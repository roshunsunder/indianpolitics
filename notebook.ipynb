On Friday, 9 November, at a Medtronic conference in Los Angeles, eminent Indian-American Dr Sampat Shivangi introduced Gabbard, 37, and said that she could be the next president of the US in 2020. The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didn’t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didn’t deny it either. Tulsi Gabbard is an American politician of the Democratic Party serving as the US Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district since 2013. Gabbard, who represents a constituency in Hawaii, is not of Indian descent and neither of her parents are Hindu, but she practises Hinduism. Gabbard was born in 1981 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children born to Carol and Mike Gabbard, a State Senator. In 2002, Gabbard became the youngest person ever to be elected to the Hawaii State Legislative, and in 2012, she was elected to the US House. She went on to win the general election by nearly 80 points. She is one of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, and she was deployed with the Hawaii National Guard to Iraq in 2005 and Kuwait in 2009. According to a report in , Gabbard became one of the most popular political figures after she broke with the Democratic Party establishment and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016, even resigning as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to be able to do so. In 2004, Gabbard volunteered to join the 29 Brigade of US soldiers when they were called to war in Iraq. According to Gabbard’s website, “She (Gabbard) felt it was more important to stand in solidarity with her fellow soldiers than to climb the political ladder.” However, Gabbard’s critics have questioned her views on foreign policy and her tolerance of dictators like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard came under attack after she met Assad in 2017. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Trapper, she said that she hadn’t planned on meeting him but when the opportunity arose, she did, because she felt it was important. Democratic leaders maintained silence on one of their leaders meeting a head of state who has been dubbed a war criminal by the US. Then, in April 2017, Gabbard’s stand on the chemical attack in Syria raised eyebrows again. According to an article in  , in 2015, Gabbard was among the Democrats who voted for restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She had also expressed “skepticism” about the widely held assertion that Assad’s government was behind chemical attacks in Syria. After the 2002 Gujarat riots, the US government had denied a visa to Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Gabbard was one of the few to criticise the US government’s decision. According to an article in  , five months after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India, Gabbard opposed a resolution which called for “religious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials,” saying that it would weaken India-US relations. In August 2014, Gabbard made it a point to meet Modi in New York after his Madison Square Garden speech and presented him a copy of the  that she swore by when she was elected.

It is extremely unfortunate for the bureau, as it hosts officers of impeccable integrity. They would indeed feel disturbed and so would the citizens who frequently demand CBI investigation in complicated, sensitive and controversial crimes. Criminal cases against its former directors – Ranjit Sinha and AP Singh – to say nothing of the unceremonious transfer of its past Special Director Rupak Dutta, tipped to be the director in 2017 – are some of the recent instances that have cast a shadow over the bureau. But more so, on the procedure followed for selecting the top boss of the agency. In the process, merit is relegated to the back burner, as was in the case of the untimely transfer of Rupak Dutta to ‘accommodate’ the current incumbent Alok Verma, and the controversial induction/promotion of the Special Director Rakesh Asthana. The high-powered panel for the selection of the director of the CBI has as three members ie the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. Yet, two of its past directors have been tainted – they have been accused in criminal cases. It is thus a poignant comment on the selection procedure, and a travesty of the highest order. The CBI comes under the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), thus directly under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It has a presence in most states in the country. The Bureau has also been notified as the Interpol of India for the purpose of liaison with police organisations of other countries, and to facilitate cooperation in international cases. There are two types of officers in the CBI – directly recruited officer investigators / support staff, and investigators and supervisors inducted on deputation from outside. The leadership lies with the Indian Police Service (IPS), with officers selected from all over the country. The CBI does not have a policy like the Intelligence Bureau (IB) or Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wherein the officers on deputation can get permanently absorbed. At any given time, there are about 20 percent and above vacancies, for various reasons like state police officers being unwilling to come on deputation etc. As per the CBI manual, the superintendent and above have specified powers for registration of cases, and the CBI follows it scrupulously. An officer of a particular rank can register an economic offence of a particular magnitude at his / her level, and to go above that, they need the permission of the rank above them. Similar guidelines on the basis of ranks exist for registering offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. There are legal advisers at each stage of investigation, and a follow-up of cases in courts is quite good. However, on occasion, the quality of its investigation and prosecution have been criticised by the courts as in the 2G spectrum allocation case recently. At other times, the courts have come down heavily on the CBI’s decisions, with the Supreme Court terming it as ‘caged parrot’ and ‘His master’s voice’. The internal vigilance wing has often nabbed some of its corrupt officers and prosecutors, proving that the CBI has its own black sheep. The pendency of cases however is mounting, despite special courts designated to handle CBI cases. These are issues of serious concern. In most cases, the investigation is of high standard, and the investigating officers are encouraged to pursue the collection of scientific evidence. The conviction rate is higher in CBI cases, as the investigating officers do not have to handle other departments like law and order / security/ VIP duties. They devote their full time to investigation. When I joined the Bureau in 1999, I was impressed by the depth of discussion and focus on investigation. I also found that the investigating officers took much longer to complete an investigation – some in the hope that more cases would not come their way if they go slow on the earlier ones! But by and large, the work culture and environment had been highly professional. During the '90s, the Bureau was given more resources, and the millennium saw special allowances – 25 percent of the pay for ranks up to the Superintendent of Police, and 15 percent, for ranks above it. The officers also feel that they do not have the facilities and amenities of local police investigation units. Still the conviction rate (of above 65 percent), is one of the best in the country. The more recently created National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take decades to come up to the benchmark set by the CBI. In most of the cases, the investigators work independently, but in some cases, there are pressures from different quarters. Most officers are able to withstand these pressures, as documentation is very strong within the CBI. If you are able to justify your stand on paper, it is difficult to be overruled. However, some officers do find cunning ways to bypass these, including taking legal opinion in their favour. Courts intervene occasionally and initiate direct supervision with clear direction not to transfer/shift the investigating officers and the supervisors – as was the case with the investigation of the 2G spectrum allocation case, and coal scam cases. With a professional work culture, a strong internal vigilance wing, and an internationally-acclaimed training set-up, the Central Bureau of Investigation holds its head high – more often than not. On the whole, having worked in the CBI, I can safely vouch for its professionalism, and fervently hope that the current director and special director resolve their differences for a higher cause, that is, the ethos of their organisation. Both officers being from the Indian Police Service, should stand up for the ‘service of the people’ and NOT for ‘the service of the party in power’.

But it is also equally true for the filmmakers themselves, who are often stuck in the past, unresponsive to the present environment, reacting to it only through memories. And then there are those filmmakers who receive an instant emotional blow from the socio-political situation of the present and hurl away the burden of the past to deliver a message for the present. His cinema can be divided into distinct periods, etching out the contemporary sensibilities of the times they were made in. My first experience of a Mrinal Sen film was of    which shows a young boy dying of suffocation on a winter night, in a middle-class Bengali household’s kitchen. I had seen   only too often — working in the houses of some of my friends, whom I would visit after school. Mrinal Sen’s    , which shows a film crew attempting to make a film based on the Bengal famine (set in a village of the day), fuses the horrors of history with the struggles of contemporary life. The classical structure of a ‘film within a film’ has been used by Sen to show how fiction and reality often converge. Durga, an ordinary village woman, who witnesses the film shoot, begins to empathise with a character portrayed in the film. The hardships faced by Durga in real life, and this character, are very similar. Mrinal Sen also depicts the exploitation of the innocent, ignorant villagers at the hands of the privileged film personalities. Sen made this film at a time when he wanted to study characters through a socio-political lens — understanding their responses, moral dilemmas, self-corruption and exploitation, which can then provoke the spectator to start a discussion. In dramas like   and  Sen sheds light on the moralities of the society of the day, especially exposing the so-called Bhadralok (gentleman) culture. In  , a middle-class family’s fate hangs in the balance as their eldest daughter, the sole breadwinner, fails to come home one night. Similarly, in  , the father, the family’s patriarch, goes missing. My understanding of Mrinal Sen completely changed once I went to college and got involved in the politics of the day. I had a lot to say, and I was ready to shout over the burst of other voices. Mrinal Sen started ‘shouting out his own politics’ with his cult-classic   at a time when the Naxalite movement was at its peak, and world cinema was highly influenced by the French New Wave and Czech New Wave. The film is highly stylised with use of freeze frames and stop-motion animation. An animation sequence builds up the character of Shome (who is mostly engrossed in office work) through pens, books, files, sheets, but without actually showing him. Thus, Sen developed a new language for Indian filmmakers, giving birth to the Indian New Wave. The period demanded that Sen shout out his views over ear-blasting bombings and cries of mothers of youths shot dead by police. Mrinal Sen’s   trilogy, a set of overly political films narrated in the new vocabulary of the day, also emerged around the same time. Sen breaks the fourth wall in  , and directly speaks to the camera.  and   the other two films in the  trilogy – both deal with questions of leadership and exploitation by the higher-ups. Sen used ‘juxtaposition’ as an important cinematic tool to jar the spectators out of the illusion of cinema. Mrinal Sen’s cinema has not only inspired other films, but also compelled other filmmakers to document his life and work. The creation of a new wave in Indian cinema, which was subsequently continued by the likes of Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Shyam Benegal, can be credited to Sen. Sen completely distrusts Ramani’s presence and his sensibilities — Sen’s aura, comes out with an absolute honesty in the final documentary, which in the last sequence, cuts to Sen watching himself on screen as Ramani shows him the footage for approval. Mrinal Sen, the ‘master’ smiles at his ‘other self’, jarred out of illusion into realism through his most favourite cinematic device of all — the ‘cut’. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 3 July 1995, Delhi woke up to a crime that was less gruesome in execution but was brutal enough when it came to removing evidence, including the victim’s body. In the post-liberalisation era, even as blaring 24*7 news channels were yet to arrive on the scene, few newspapers made sure that the readers had every salacious bit on their platter daily. The accused Sushil Sharma, a former Youth Congress leader, someone who was known for his proximity to senior leaders, had shot his wife dead and then tried to burn her body.  It was perhaps the sheer grit and dogged effort by Pereira and his team which ensured that Sharma was behind bars. But it wasn’t so easy for the Delhi Police that faced many challenges during investigation, as explained vividly by Pereira in his book,  . This observation was contrary to the claim by the police that Naina Sahni's death was caused due to injury caused by a bullet wound with the shot being fired from a very close range. The police had retrieved bullets and empty cartridges from Sushil Sharma's flat at Mandir Marg where traces of blood were found on the mattress in the bedroom. Just because the X-ray machine at the Lady Hardinge Medical College was non-functional and the body was burnt beyond recognition, the first autopsy report had overlooked the injury mark in the corpse caused by the bullets. It was the second autopsy report that favoured the sequence of events as was established by the Delhi Police in its probe. Pereira feels that such procedural hassles are part of the job for investigating officers: Speaking to  , Pereira also shared how important it was for the police force then in 1995 to win back the confidence of people. Sharma was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2007. On 8 October 2013, the Supreme Court commuted Sushil Sharma’s death sentence to life imprisonment. In its judgment, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, P Sathasivam had  : The Court was of the view that chances of reformation of Sharma can’t be ruled out. Sushil Sharma has already served 23 years behind bars. So should he now be allowed to live a normal life outside jail on grounds of good behaviour? It was this question that resulted in a fierce debate between the author and audience at the book launch. A counselor at the Tihar Jail, who was present at the book launch, shared her experience of interacting with Sharma, as she claimed, “he regrets his action”. In 2016, the Supreme Court   that “a sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years”. Which means that the release of Sushil Sharma would be tough “unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentence”. According to Maxwell Pereira, “the police had done its job and now it’s up to the institutions who take decisions on such matters”. What happened to Constable Abdul Nazeer Kunju, the man, who was on night duty at the Connaught Place police station on 2 July 1995? It was Kunju who had rushed inside the Bagiya restaurant after a woman came out shouting,  It was Kunju who first spotted Sushil along with his friend Keshav as both were busy throwing pamphlets and posters into the fire. ‘He left the police service’, Pereira told the audience, when he was asked about Kunju. After his stint as the hero, who had helped in unravelling a gruesome crime, it was the slow pace of promotion in the hierarchical setup of the police that led to Kunju calling it quits. While Kunju was able to resist all the efforts of Sushil Sharma to intimidate him, the poor guy found it difficult to overcome disillusionment that dawned after years of performing his duties with utmost sincerity. Lack of motivation is perhaps among the many ills ailing the police force. Pereira still reminisces the ability of Kunju to react fast to an unwarranted situation, which in this case, led to the discovery of a charred body:       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 23 November 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were travelling by bus from Hyderabad to Sangli in Mahrashtra. While on the way, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) stopped the bus and abducted the couple. Three days later, on 26 November, Sohrabuddin was shot dead in what the police called an encounter, but it was later found to be fake by the investigators. In total, several prosecution witnesses have deposed before the court since 29 November 2017. The same day, the special CBI court passed a gag order restraining media from reporting the case based on an application by the defence lawyer. On 24 January this year, the Bombay High Court struck down the gag order. According to sources, all hostile witnesses are crucial, and some of them are also eyewitnesses in the case. Among these, five of their statements were recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, while others had theirs recorded by the investigating agency. Below are details of the testimony/statements of 13 crucial witnesses: , the sister of Kalimuddin, an associate of Sohrabuddin, had stated to the investigating agency that her brother hosted Sohrabuddin and his wife in Hyderabad in mid-November 2005. It is from their house that Sohrabuddin and his wife left for Sangli. Kalimuddin was also wanted in several criminal cases by the Andhra Pradesh Police. But during cross-examination, Saleema denied even having met Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi. Saleema’s retraction of her earlier statement will impact the case because this raises questions over whether Sohrabuddin and his wife went to Hyderabad or boarded the bus to Sangli. Here are the names of some other hostile witnesses: According to the prosecution, key witnesses turning hostile is a major setback for the case. According to a legal expert: Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had boarded a luxury bus from Hyderabad to go to Sangli in Maharashtra at around 9 pm on 22 November 2005. But while they were on the way, a group of policemen from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh allegedly kidnapped them. A passenger inside the bus told the investigator that an SUV blocked their bus and three policemen with guns abducted Sohrabuddin and his wife. Kausar Bi refused to allow the police to take him, and so she too was abducted by the police. Based on the statements of some witnesses, Sohrabuddin and his wife were brought to Ahmedabad’s Disha Farm where both of them were illegally detained and later killed, according to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI. According to the Gujarat ATS, Sohrabuddin was a sharp shooter and had underworld connections. He had come to the city at the behest of the Lashker-e-Taiba and the ISI to assassinate a political leader. The Gujarat Police acted on the basis of an intelligence input from the Rajasthan Police, who were also part of the encounter team. The Gujarat Police also claimed that Sohrabuddin was wanted in an arms case in Madhya Pradesh and in a murder case in Rajasthan. According to the Gujarat police, Sohrabuddin was operating from Narol area in Ahmedabad, when the police spotted him riding a bike near the Vishala circle, they tried to intercept but he didn't stop. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sohrabuddin shot at policemen and in self-defence police retaliated, killing him. They offer no explanation for how Kausar Bi was killed. Some key witnesses who are yet to be cross-examined in court are:  once a close associate of Sohrabuddin, turned hostile from his earlier statement recorded before the CBI. In an affidavit before the designated CBI court, witness claimed that the statements attributed to him against the former Deputy Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, Abhay Chudasma, and others, were “taken by the investigating agency under duress.” He also charged the CBI with “acting on the instructions of Congress leaders of Gujarat.” In 2006,  the IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was made the supervisory officer of the Sohrabuddin case before it was handed over to the CBI. Solanki’s investigation revealed that apart from Sohrabuddin, Kausar Bi was also killed as a coverup. This revelation led to the arrests of Gujarat-cadre IPS officers DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian, and Dinesh MN of the Rajasthan cadre. Later, the CBI, in its findings, charge-sheeted Geetha Johri for allegedly botching up the investigation. The agency accused her of projecting that the third person abducted along with Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi was a person named Kalimuddin and not Tulsiram Prajapati. The first investigating officer of the Gujarat Police gave a statement to the CBI against  , saying she was working under pressure from now Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah. She botched-up the case by giving a false report stating that third person on the bus was not Tulsiram Prajapati. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Raje’s government? Pilot goes on to say, “So, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara ji’s government. So it’s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Raje’s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.” From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to ‘Gaurav Yatra’, Raje should have taken out a ‘Pashchatap Yatra’. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congress’s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. It’s illegal, it’s immoral to use taxpayers’ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJP’s money to organise meetings? “Today, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,” continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congress’s counter-narrative to Raje’s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had ‘mera booth, mera gaurav’ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the ‘Shakti’ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. That’s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, “We (Congress) are doing ‘Sankalp’ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.” Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback we’ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So it’s a very positive indication, and I’m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, we’ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And that’s where I think the Congress party’s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Even as the TDP MLA was jailed, a tape was produced (and leaked to TV channels) where a voice suspiciously similar to that of Chandrababu Naidu’s, was found saying something incriminating. This was an opportunity for KCR’s Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to poach TDP MLAs who Naidu had told to fend for themselves. At the same time, to ensure that Andhra industrialists did not flee to Andhra Pradesh leaving Hyderabad high and dry, KCR appointed his son KT Rama Rao (KTR) to woo them. The savvy KTR, who is IT and Urban Development Minister in KCR’s government, was able to win the confidence of these industrialists who were at the receiving end during the Telangana statehood movement. Naidu is hailed as the father of modern Hyderabad, who got Microsoft and other IT investments. But KTR is following in his footsteps and has been able to woo many others. “Hyderabad is a boom town now,” is the refrain of investors. Although he is believed to have strategised Naidu’s victory in 1999, Naidu jettisoned KCR, relegating him to the post of the Assembly’s deputy speaker. A miffed KCR left TDP and formed TRS to fight for a separate state. The new state was created by Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the 2014 elections. Before Telangana was announced, KCR had declared his allegiance to Sonia — who he said was like his own ‘mother’ and even promised to merge his party into the Congress if ‘he was given a free hand.’ But none of this happened, and the TRS and Congress are now arch rivals. Even as KCR wants to decimate the Congress, analysts aver that he has a tacit understanding with the BJP because this is what the saffron party also wants. However, in April 2017, KCR got a bill passed in the Telangana Assembly to provide reservations to backward Muslims in colleges and for jobs. This is unlikely to be notified by the central government, because reservations on religious basis have been struck down by the courts. Moreover, with the latest proposals, total reservations will go way beyond the constitutionally mandated upper limit of 50 percent. KCR, who runs the state with an iron hand and has promoted his daughter and nephew besides his son, is seen as a wily politician with a clear game plan in mind. This is why he is being taken seriously as he unfolds the federal front plan. K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is a man known for setting his goals high. Figuring that the ‘Modi magic’ of 2014 has all but vanished and has not been replaced by a Rahul Gandhi upsurge, KCR is fancying his chances as the next prime minister of India, suggest highly-placed sources. Donning the robe of a messiah, KCR has been announcing that “People are vexed that there is no qualitative change, even after 70 years of democracy.” KCR, as has been reported, travelled to Kolkata to confabulate with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for forming a federal front. He has also met CPM’s Sitaram Yechury with the same idea. The leaders of many likely federal front partners with more seats (like Mamata with 42 seats in West Bengal) might harbour prime ministerial ambitions themselves. But KCR, with his proficiency in both Hindi and English, and being from south India, feels that he has an edge over others (What does the first-time woman voter want?

As the Legislative Assembly goes to polls on 7 December, narratives of families of farmer suicides in the prosperous Nalgonda district, highlight how little their life has changed. Nalgonda has the highest number of farmer suicides, according to data available since the state’s formation. Kathula Venkataiah, 45, committed suicide like thousands of farmers do every year in India, because of crop failure and unpaid debts. But this farmer suicide was different. A resident of Manimadde village of Shali Gowraram mandal in Nalgonda district, Venkataiah was a staunch supporter of the separate state of Telangana. He had participated in village marches and believed that Telangana’s statehood would be the best solution for the rural distress he himself faced, and witnessed around him. And yet, he killed himself 12 days after the formation of Telangana on 2 June 2014. Inability to repay debt was the main reason for Venkataiah’s suicide; he had owed Rs 4,30,000 at the time of his death, according to official documents. As Venkataiah did not own land, banks had trouble lending to him, and he borrowed from private moneylenders on an interest of Rs 1.50 to Rs 2. This dependence on private moneylenders is despite over 83 percent rural access to bank credit, according to the same report. Further, government schemes like Rythu Bandhu, are meant for farmers who cultivate their own land, and not for tenant/landless farmers who are the worst affected by distress. A report by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with TISS in 2018, finds that 20 percent of land in the state is cultivated by tenant farmers, but they account for 75 percent of farmer suicides in Telangana. The children of tenant farmers face a different challenge; there is no land to farm, and education does not lead to employment. Even with 64.2 percent literacy rate, Nalgonda district has only 49.9 percent working population, according to the 2011 Census. It is not surprising therefore, that after Venkataiah’s death, all his three children dropped out of school to earn a livelihood instead. In Manimadde village, where the family met this reporter this week, they live in a half-constructed two-room house of cement and brick. Part of the state compensation paid after Venkataiah’s death had gone into building the house, but was not enough to finish it. In another part of Nalgonda in Chandanpally village, Rupani Radha recalls the death of her husband, Janayya, in November 2014, four months after the formation of Telangana state. She now supports three children between the ages of 8-14 years, through farm labour, and by cultivating cotton on 2 acres of rain-fed land that used to belong to her husband. The land is now in the name of her 8-year-old son, transferred by her husband’s family after his death. This has proved a hurdle for getting benefits of government schemes as her son is not of age. Welfare had failed to assist her in times of need. For instance, when she had to undergo a surgery for kidney stones in June 2018, she had to borrow Rs 1 lakh from private sources. She says that the free health scheme ‘Aarogyasri’ would have taken time to come though, and she could not wait. And now, after the surgery, the loan has added to her burden as she is unable to do farm labour to repay it. Radha’s only other option is agriculture. “I must work as farm labour to pay for the cotton crop on our field. I have harvested about 5 quintals, which will fetch me about Rs 20,000, but I will make no profit,” she says. But like Narsamma, even Radha must reconcile to the indifference of the state that no longer needs the farmer, except perhaps, during elections.  ‘ ’ by        (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Founded in 1959, by C Rajagopalachari, one of India’s greatest political thinkers and leaders, as well as literary giants, Swatantra Party arrived on the Indian political scene with a bash. The archive features correspondences, office memorandums, meeting minutes, speech drafts, party literature and publications, and many personal notes shared by the party leaders, allowing us a glimpse into the life of the party as it was conceived, formed, and introduced to the larger Indian political scene. A small correspondence between Indira Gandhi and MR Masani, notes shared by Masani and Rajaji are among the many treasures housed in the archive. In the letter issued from the Prime Ministers Office on 12 March 1967, Indira Gandhi invites Mr Masani to join her in an informal meeting with parliamentary leaders, before the inaugural session of Lok Sabha. The letter reads: “I write this to invite you to an informal meeting of Leaders of different Parties in Parliament so that we have an opportunity of meeting one another on the eve of the session and to exchange views on matters of common interest. I should like to maintain similar contact throughout the session if you find the idea appropriate and useful. I wonder if we could have our first meeting at 10 am on 15th March in my office in Parliament House. I hope you will find it convenient to join.” A handwritten note by C Rajagopalachari, addressed to Mr Homi Mody, a lawyer, administrator, businessman, and social reformer is another valuable find. Homi, a moniker for Sir Hormasji Pherozshah Modi, held a variety of public offices as Chairman of Bombay Municipal Corporation (1913), a member of Indian legislative assembly (1929-1943), a member of Viceroy’s Executive Council (1943), a member of Constituent Assembly of India, and governor of United Provinces and Uttar Pradesh (1949-52). In the note C Rajagopalachari expresses his gratitude to Mody for leading the early collection efforts to establish the corpus of funds for the party. Written on 20 October 1959 – Swatantra's founding year – the note states, “It was kind of you to write and give a cheerful account of the collection work. I had intended to write to our staff about the need for active assistance but as I have just read your letter, I feel it is unnecessary. I cannot tell you how greatly I feel heartened by your continued support. Tyranny cannot be brought to an end until the victims shed fear. Our 'friends' are going to get more and more autocratic and dictatorial seeing that we are gathering strength...” The archive has been successfully restored and digitised by the efforts of the Centre for Civil Society as a part of its Indian Liberals digital archive project, and will be placed at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library for public engagement, and will soon be available on the open Indian Liberal website for visitors. According to Rajaji, a liberal democracy rests on four pillars, or feet: an active citizenry, prudent statesmen, a responsible parliament, and independent judiciary. The party was Rajaji’s response to the rise of what he saw as the ‘one-footed’ democracy—a monolithic Congress system, which had erupted due to the absence of a sustained and principled opposition, and a fractured electoral system which rewarded expensive campaigns mounted by those in power with subsequent victories. Rajaji’s greatest concern was the rise of majoritarianism, which he felt was eroding the democratic nature of our public institutions. Congress’ eclipsing victories at national and state level in the 1950s, the abuse of ordinances by the Nehru Government in the early 1950s as a means to subvert scrutiny by both houses, the misuse of Ninth Schedule to overcome judicial review, and the increase in instances of agitation and boycott by Parliamentarians troubled Rajaji, for they threatened to erode the sanctity of institutional procedures. Writing on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 1963, he argued “democracy in a pluralist society is sustained not by force of numbers but by the vital force of trust, the maintenance of which must, therefore be the greatest concern of statesmen guiding democracies.” No less than a year old, it commanded the presence of many of India’s greatest statesmen and thinkers. M R Masani, Dahyabhai Patel (son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Sir Homi Mody, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, VP Menon, Maridas Ruthnaswamy, N G Ranga, and more. The party boasted of a wide and diverse leadership, bringing together voices from the South as well as Northern India, peasant and agrarian activists and aristocrats on one platform. The party had offices and regional centres in Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Patna, with units in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It was the only national party to not have an office in Delhi, and this was done to ensure candidates and party leaders stayed close to their respective constituencies. The party also held one of the few female members of royal families to participate in electoral politics: Maharani Gayatri Devi, who campaigned relentlessly for the party in the 1962 elections. While the party performed well in the general elections of 1962 and 1967, it could not withstand the rising forces of extremism and majoritarianism in the 1970s, and floundered after Rajaji’s demise in 1974 – only a few months before the imposition of Emergency.

So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didn’t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, “Make an offer I cannot refuse.” So yeah, they made an offer I couldn’t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But don’t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I don’t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised they’ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. I’ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasn’t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? I’m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you can’t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didn’t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her – your wife, Chitra Singh – of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I don’t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

But just a few months ago, Michel had reportedly gone missing. Michel’s lawyer, Amal Alsubei had told   that Michel had gone missing from the day UAE went to the court. Alsubei also added that the middleman in the Rs 3,600 crore deal will be arrested when found, and that he is likely to appeal in Supreme Court. According to the reports, on 26 August, UAE had asked a court on the possibility of extraditing a British national, not specifically Michel, to a third country,   reported. The reports of Michel going missing came a day after reports of a UAE court ordering extradition of the middleman to India surfaced. Michel was arrested in the UAE in 2017 and was out on bail then. At the time of the Rs 3,600-crore scam (early 2013), Christian Michel was a well-known British consultant who was very active in the Indian defence sector. It was alleged that he was hired by AgustaWestland to facilitate the deal for the supply of 12 helicopters to India in 2010. Michel is one of the three middlemen being probed in the case, besides Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, by the ED and CBI. The ED had also brought on the record that the three middlemen \"managed to\" make inroads into the Indian Air Force (IAF) to influence the stand of officials to reduce the service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres in 2005, according to PTI. AgustaWestland became eligible to supply the dozen helicopters for VVIP flying duties after this change. Moreover, according to ED investigation, remittances made by Michel through his Dubai-based firm Global Services to a media firm he floated in Delhi, along with two Indians, were made from the funds which he got from AgustaWestland through “criminal activity” and corruption being done in the chopper deal, reported PTI. In July 2018, after he was granted bail in Dubai, Michel had accused Indian investigators of pressuring him to name UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and frame senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in return for a clean chit in the multi-crore scam. On 19 July, while he was in custody, his lawyer Rosemary Patrizi had made similar charges against the Indian probe agencies, although CBI had denied the allegations.

As ruling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is busy promising welfare schemes to farmers, he has competition brewing in the opposition camp. Congress leader Uttam Kumar Reddy has filed his nomination in his home ground, the Huzurnagar constituency, and many say he could be the chief ministerial candidate floated by the grand alliance. The rally saw hundreds of people dancing, flags waving, loud sloganeering and   (folk dance). caught up with the Congress leader to find out how he plans to defeat the KCR government this time. In a candid conversation, Reddy said that he hopes their party doesn’t repeat any of these mistakes. “This time, we have been far more careful and hopefully those mistakes won't be repeated. I am fairly sure that the people's front we have formed now – Congress-TDP-CPM-TJS – we will win the elections with an overwhelming majority,” said Reddy. He criticised the ruling government for failing farmers, youth and women. “He promised something and didn’t do it. He looted the state. He has been an oppressive dictator, trying to suppress people's rights. I think he has been exposed now,” he added. He alleged that the chief minister’s move to dissolve the Telangana Assembly was a conspiracy. On 6 September 2018, KCR recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for early elections. He had said that he was doing it in the interests of the state, and that he wanted to curb the state’s political fragility. However, Reddy said he suspects the early election has been a result of a conspiracy between PM Narendra Modi, the Election Commission, and KCR. He said there was no other explanation for how the schedule announced by KCR was exactly the same as what was announced by the Election Commission. Reddy was a former fighter pilot and served as the Comptroller of Security, Protocol, Administration, Foreign Trips of the President at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. He is a four-time MLA and a former minister of Housing. Reddy said his agenda, if elected to power, would be to introduce farm loan waivers, unemployment toll, financial incentives to women’s self-help groups, and remunerative prices for farmers to purchase crops. If Congress wins, Reddy could become the chief minister – but when asked, he chooses to leave it to Rahul Gandhi. “I have no such ambitions. My limited role is to lead the Congress party this election. And I think I will do that successfully. The next step is in the hands of Rahul Gandhi,” he said.

Tasked with guarding borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, the force has a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of nation. 53 years ago, policy makers conceived of a force capable of guarding borders during peace, and to assist the army as the first line of defence during hostilities, because of the inability of the disparate State Armed Forces to stand up to even minor threats from Pakistani forces, and lack of uniformity in dealing with its counterparts. The force has grown from about 25,000 in 1965, to about 2.5 lakhs now. This mammoth growth has been in spurts, causing many problems of human resource management. The policy planners erred in ensuring a smooth phased expansion to prevent the personnel management dilemma that the force is now faced with. However, the one-time benefits of such rapid expansion has reached its saturation point, and the personnel are now stagnating for long periods, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralisation. A  takes anything from 20 to 24 years to earn his first promotion. The situation of the cadre officers of the force has always been precarious, with most of them retiring at the middle rungs. Efforts to address the problem of stagnation have lacked vision, and amounted only to fire fighting. For example, in order to bring parity with the police, the ranks of Lance Naik were abolished, thus disturbing the rank structure of a “section” which is the basic sub-unit. Similarly, the introduction of the rank of assistant sub inspector has disturbed the structure of “platoon”. The cadre review exercise for officers has, without aiming for long-term solutions, resulted only in one-time postponement of stagnation through proliferation of ranks in the battalions. Avenues created at higher levels do not accrue to cadre officers because of the rule position, and these have been usurped by IPS officers. He frequently encounters life-threatening situations, but is now not entitled to pension which his counterpart in defence forces get. Large numbers of BSF units are deployed on the Line of Control, and perform the same duties as the Army. Yet, he gets almost 25 percent less than his Army counterpart. Further, in case of an unfortunate death in the line of duty, the family of a deceased BSF soldier is deprived of many benefits available to the family of an Army Jawan, because there is no provision for a BSF soldier to be declared a martyr. BSF personnel spend most of their life on BOPs where the extended duty hours – sometimes 16 per day, enable only an interrupted sleep. To make matters worse, the living conditions at most of the BOPs are unsatisfactory. A recent report stated that out of the 66 BOPs in Barmer sector of BSF, only two had facilities for piped drinking water. The rest depended upon water tankers. The above conditions coupled with the inability to meet urgent family obligations, cause a lot of stress, resulting in a high rate of attrition. As per a reply to a parliament question, 11,192 BSF personnel have either resigned or proceeded on voluntary retirement from 2015 up-to Jan 2018. The prevalent security environment now – both internal and external – is vastly different from that in 1965. The proxy war by Pakistan has kept our western borders troubled, requiring aggressive border management practices. The Bangladesh border grapples with a threat of a different kind, with armed cattle smugglers attacking BSF soldiers, when intercepted. Heavy population density, lack of development and employment opportunities makes these borders highly crime prone. The BSF is thus faced with the policy dilemma of averting use of force to conform to the national objective of maintaining good relations with Bangladesh, and ensuring the safety and security of soldiers, while preventing crime. Man-power intensive border guarding practices are no longer adequate, and suitable technology has to be introduced to assist border men. Technological interventions in the shape of first and second generation NVDs have had a rather limited effect, and the situation on ground remains unchanged. These devices, besides having out lived their life, are cumbersome and  user-friendly. The organisation also has not invested in familiarizing troops with the usage of these devices, which is another reason for reluctance on the part of troops to use them. The technology sought to be introduced is generally vendor-driven, which more often than not, fails on ground. Trials must be carried out over an extended period in operational conditions before induction. Aspects of training in their use, maintenance etc must also be built in the contract to prevent long turn over time for repairs. Proper facilities should be created at BOPs to derive optimum advantage from devices like Thermal Imagers. Annual competition to encourage innovation remains just an event, and none of the projects have been taken up for large scale production to ease the burden on troops. The mindset of the commanders therefore, requires a generational change, as the constabulary now is educated and well-informed. To be able to adopt “smart border management” practices they should be encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and adequate training in use of technical gadgets introduced in the force. The training philosophy also needs to orient itself with the present day operational environment. While western borders need aggressive domination and “Ek goli ek dushman” type of training is still relevant, the eastern borders require troops to exercise restraint. This must therefore be incorporated in the basic induction training, and also when troops get deployed in those areas. Frequent deployment in counter-insurgency operations also necessitates incorporation of these aspects in the training. As mentioned above, border guarding is rapidly transforming into integrated border management where several agencies are equal stake holders. Borders will, in the near future, transform from barriers to bridges between nations. A smart border man therefore has to be aware of the developing scenario and understand the functioning of different agencies involved with the functioning of “integrated check posts” and “land custom stations” to facilitate the hassle-free movement of personnel and goods across the borders. Trained in policing duties, they are unable to come to grips with the complexities a large organisation like the BSF, and the dynamics of border management. The government has to give a serious thought and rectify this anomalous situation by handing over the baton to cadre officers, who, over the years, have acquired enough experience and maturity to take up the responsibility.

On Monday, 26 November, Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone at the Indian side at Dera Baba Nanak, three kilometers from the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak spent the last 17 years of his life. If this project reaches fruition by next November, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, it could mark a seachange in relations between arch rivals India and Pakistan. It could also set a precedent for the role religion can play to bring peace among erstwhile enemy nations and become a clarion call for peace in South Asia. Perhaps the most common critique of all religions is Karl Marx's phrase: opiate of the masses. The fact is that this phrase follows a longer sentence in which Marx describes the value of religion in human society. “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opiate of the people.” Since Marx’s utterance, while bashing religion, we often forget the value of religion and pick only its negative consequences. There are good reasons for it. There are umpteen examples of how communalism spreads, how politicians use religion to divide society, how competitive one-upmanship leads to violence, pogroms, riots and sectarianism. The Partition of India and Pakistan is considered the greatest exile in human history. It caused one million deaths and 14 million displacements. Ordinary people turned looters and plunderers. Even neighbours turned against each other – all in the name of religion. For the Hindu and Muslim populations, the Partition caused loss of a sense of belonging to their birth and natural environments and devastated their economies. For the Sikhs, who opposed Partition, the event also caused separation from some of their most significant religious places, including the place of birth and passing away of their founder, Guru Nanak. The Sikhs prayers include the  performed in the presence of the  or for various small and big ceremonies. The  has three parts. The first and third part are fixed but the second part can be changed to suit the occasion. After 1947, the Sikhs included the following text in the second part of their  : “ ” entres of religion, from which we have been separated.” For 71 years now, in spite of how New Delhi and Islamabad define the relationship between India and Pakistan, the Sikhs have been making the prayer to unite with their Gurdwaras. The developments this week seemed impossible just three months ago when Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan and hugged their Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had proposed the corridor. The nationalist television studios, ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), called him a ‘traitor’. Sidhu was abused and mocked. Today, the same Indian government is supporting the corridor. The BJP, which has made ‘hate Pakistan’ its major agenda, would have never agreed for such a project, but came in to glorify its beleaguered alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal. The cynical propaganda against the corridor shows how far the national narrative is from both east and west Punjab whose people share language, culture, deep bonds and have always aspired for peace. The national discourse does not get a simple fact: when two Punjabis meet, they hug as a way of greeting each other. It does not get it that former cricket stalwarts Imran Khan and Navjot Sidhu seek to re-write history. Guru Nanak says: “ ” “If you yearn to play love/enter with your head on your palm.” It is that moment for India and Pakistan. The call is whether we – both nations – want to play love, in this context with our neighbour. To fall apart, the proposal just needs: The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was freely accessible until the 1960s. In the early 2000s, Pakistan made an attempt to open access, but was thwarted by the Indian government. The SAD was in power, and SGPC was in control. That is why, since then, people have been having the   through binoculars at the Border Security Force post at Dera Baba Nanak. It is set to change now. If this project succeeds, it may lead to access to other 194 Gurdwaras included in the Sikh Ardas. It may lead to better trade and cultural ties between the two Punjabs and nations. Most of all, it would lead to demilitarisation of two poverty-stricken nations and better spending on education, health-care and employment. Certainly those are what people of both nations seek from their governments. It is a razor’s edge. As we say in Punjab:      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Well-informed sources say there has been much criticism within the government, even at the highest level, of the way things have been handled. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and some in the national security establishment are said to be most displeased. Governor Satya Pal Malik, who is in the eye of the storm, even said on Wednesday, 28 November, that he might be transferred. If that indeed happens, it would be the result of his frequent public statements. Malik’s stating that the Centre wanted him to install Sajjad Lone as the chief minister, has been damaging to both Lone and those in charge at the Centre. Associates of Lone, whose People’s Conference party has two MLAs in the house, have even said that this could get him killed. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is the putative strategist who seems to have miscalculated. It was his plan that there should be a period of governor’s rule in J&K, during which the state’s administration should be cleaned up, and then a government of his choice would be installed. Amid the heartburn and criticism within the government over the past few days, top leaders have apparently made it clear that they were not party to some of the more sordid aspects of what has transpired. For instance, Mufti has alleged that central agencies such as the NIA have been misused to coerce MLAs. Lone’s associates have been very hopeful that he would be installed with the support of the BJP’s 25 MLAs and breakaway groups from the PDP, the Congress, and the National Conference. Their hopes were on a roller-coaster since July, but remained intact until last week. Their plans were overturned by the surprise move by three of the four substantial parties in the house (the other being the BJP) to form a government together. The move, which had been in the works over the previous few days, became public last Wednesday, 21 November. The house was dissolved that evening. Given the unseemly haste, it is unlikely that anyone focussed on the fact that the proposed alliance of three major parties would have been just short of two-thirds majority in the house. But the fact is that, with the help of a couple of single members, they could have attempted to amend the state’s constitution. On the other hand, the claim by the three parties acting in tandem could not be faulted. Yet, the governor initially described it as an ‘unholy alliance’. Pointing out that no formal claim had reached him, he asserted that he had played fair by not inviting either group.

Gandhi’s statement was made at the Kisan Mukti March organised by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) in collaboration with over 200 other farmers’ outfits. The rally, that began on Friday, 29 November, was organised to push for the demands of the farmers, including debt relief and remunerative prices for their produce. “The farmers are not asking for a free gift, they’re asking for what is their due,” the Congress president added. In the run-up to the 2019 general elections, Gandhi says there are two major issues in the country – the farmers’ future and the availability of jobs for the youth. With leaders from several political parties present at the protest, Gandhi said, “Though of different ideologies, all political parties are united for farmers.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The protest, which will go on for two weeks will see party members from each of the 14 districts coming to the Secretariat to protest each day. Some of the demands that BJP will be putting forth during the protest will include lifting of restrictions in Sabarimala and strict action against the police officers for allegedly foisting false case on K Surendran, the general secretary of the party. The BJP state president said that the decision to shift the protest from Sabarimala to the Secretariat comes after women between ages 10 and 50 have stopped attempting to enter the shrine. “Only if women between these ages try to enter the temple, will we begin protesting at Sabarimala again. Now that some of the restrictions are lifted, we will receive backlash from the devotees (if protests inconvenience them),” said Sreedharan Pillai. Reacting to this, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that he welcomes the BJP’s decision to shift their protests to the Secretariat. “This decision by the BJP shows they have understood that the people have started to grasp the stand of the state government regarding the Sabarimala issue,” said Pinarayi Vijayan. “It is not possible to stand straight if you take a stand that is not acceptable by the society,” said the CM. Pinarayi Vijayan also stated that the cases filed against the BJP leaders were not because of the stand taken by the state government. “All of this is a part of implementing the law. There is no point of protesting demanding the withdrawal of the case,” said Pinarayi Vijayan, who went on to add that his office has nothing to do with the cases on K Surendran. “There is nothing wrong in conducting protest in front of the Secretariat, but the BJP should introspect if the demands raised can be accepted,\" the CM said.

Is this a mere coincidence or there is something else going on here? Here’s a little philosophy around electoral bonds: On 1 February 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley declared that the donations received by political parties henceforth will not be in cash, but in the form of electoral bonds. However, the details of the donor and the receiver of this bond will be confidential. It's commonly believed that the party predicted to win the elections receives the maximum funds, in anticipation of the benefits that will accrue once the party gains power. This is the very basis of the corruption that takes place in government. An   by  ’s Poonam Agarwal revealed that electoral bonds have a hidden alphanumeric code printed on them to track down the link between donors and political parties. This apparent manoeuvring by the government poses a critical question – in the name of increased ‘transparency’ in political funding with the introduction of electoral bonds, are we being subjected to unprecedented levels of secret surveillance? Electoral bonds were promised to be anonymous as no one other than the donors themselves are supposed to know which political party they are contributing to. ’s investigation reveals that while the public will remain clueless about who has donated to which party, the government has access to those details, collated through alphanumeric codes on the electoral bonds, which are invisible to the naked eye. This adds to the government’s already burgeoning repository of data, which now may not only have details of our bank accounts and financial transactions, but also our likely political preferences.

This is how the BJP candidate Yoonus Khan is pitching himself in his electoral fight against Rajasthan Congress Chief Sachin Pilot for the Tonk seat in the state assembly polls. Khan, Transport and PWD Minister in the Vasundhara Raje government, has been fielded by the BJP in the Muslim-dominated Tonk assembly constituency, replacing the party's sitting MLA Ajit Singh Mehta after the Congress gave a ticket to Pilot in Tonk. Talking to PTI while campaigning in the rural areas of Tonk, Khan said the decision to field him was based on strategy and equations, and not on his religion. Asked about being the lone Muslim candidate of the BJP and if his nomination marked a departure from the party's strategy to not field any candidates from the minority community, he said: \"I don't know about elsewhere, but in Rajasthan, Yoonus Khan and (late BJP leader) Ramzan Khan have been fighting polls since the 80s.\" Khan said he has been the party's lone Muslim candidate once earlier also. Asked if Tonk having a large number of Muslims was one of the reasons behind his candidature, the BJP leader said the election here will be on the basis of performance and agenda. \"The election will be on who can serve Tonk better. I have given my vision... As a minister I connected Sawai Madhopur road to a two-lane road. I have given a bypass.”, he said. He also vowed to solve the problem of drinking water faced by the residents of Tonk. Pitching himself as an underdog in the high-stakes electoral battle, Khan took a swipe at his Congress rival and said, \"He (Pilot) has come for the first time, I have been a minister for long...I know the workers here.\" \"For Sachin   it is a new place, people are new and apart from his dream to become an MLA and chief minister, he does not have any other dream. I am a people's servant. You can make me serve in Deedwana (his earlier constituency) and you can make me work in Tonk,\" Khan said. Khan said Pilot was the one who has been switching constituencies, while he has been fighting from the Nagaur district (under which Deedwana falls) and has come here now on the party's instructions. While addressing a gathering in Chironj village, Khan again pitched himself as a small worker of the party who is here to serve. \"I am a sevak, not a 'pilot'. Tonk also needs a sevak not a 'pilot', he said. In another jibe at the Rajasthan Congress chief's surname, Khan asked the crowd: \"Do you have an aeroplane. Do you have a helicopter?... No, then you don't need a pilot.\" Talking to PTI, he acknowledged both he and Pilot were outsiders in Tonk, but there was one difference – \"through the power that I had in my pen (as a minister), I have given roads worth Rs 2,000 crore.\" On the Congress' charge that Khan's ticket was cut from Deedwana and was finally given one from Tonk because of his religion, he said the opposition party gives statements according to its convenience. Asked if the contest in Tonk was as keen as the one in Jhalrapatan between Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress candidate Manvendra Singh, who was earlier with the saffron party, Khan said it was on-sided contest there and \"Vasundhara ji will defeat him by about 1.25 lakh votes.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Dr Ajay Pal Sharma, Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar district has confirmed to  that the stolen data is related to Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s personal life.

Noida Police has claimed that a CD was recovered from one of the accused which allegedly contains stolen data. The CD has been sent for Forensic examination.

A small part of the ransom money was transferred into Chomwal’s bank account in two tranches, Rs 67 and Rs 2 lakhs, on 10 and 15 October, respectively.

Is Chomwal so foolish that he will agree on the transfer of the ransom money to his bank account which can act as an evidence against him in the court?

Why did Vijay and his brother transfer Rs 2 lakh to Chomwal’s bank account and then file a complaint? Was it to create evidence? Well, the FIR says that they already had Chomwal’s WhatsApp calls and messages as evidence. Sonia’s lawyer said that she was regularly attending office between 20 September and 22 October, during the period when Chomwal was blackmailing Vijay. Her lawyer claimed that there would be enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage to prove her presence in the office.

There has never been an urgent need to address this crisis more than now, and the hundreds of country’s farmers want the parliamentarians to listen, he points out. Sainath, a renowned journalist known for his ground reports that focus on the plight of the farmers, has been participating in protest marches organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). “The message behind this march is that people expect Parliament to work for the people and not just for the corporate world. When a special session of Parliament can be called for the rollout of GST, with virtually no notice, then why can’t one be called for the farmers’ issues,” he asks. He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 – and the last in 2006 – which means that “in 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.” We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. “Senseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,” Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers – both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously “the middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.” “Be it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,” he says. Sainath has been mobilising support for the farmers' march to Delhi, which has been organised in collaboration with over 200 farmers’ outfits. Hundreds of farmers from different locations marched to Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan on Thursday, 29 November. On Friday, 30 November, the farmers will walk from Ramlila Maidan to the Parliament Street to demand a Joint Session of Parliament to discuss the agrarian crisis.

Data from the   submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission of India (ECI) further substantiates this assumption. BJP was the beneficiary of 95 percent of the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. The electoral bonds scheme was notified in January 2018. March 2018 was the   when these bonds were available for purchase from four different branches of SBI (Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai & New Delhi).  using the Right to Information (RTI) revealed that a total of 520 electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were purchased in March 2018. Hence in the year 2017-18, these were the only bonds that were purchased. Most bonds (in terms of number) were purchased in Kolkata where 212 bonds were purchased. In terms of value, most bonds (worth Rs 122 crore) were purchased in Mumbai. As per the   submitted by the BJP to the ECI, the party received Rs 210 crore worth contribution in the form of electoral bonds.  This is a whopping 95 percent of all the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. Since the design of the scheme does not allow for the disclosure of names of the contributors, it is impossible to find out who contributed these Rs 210 crore to the BJP. Out of the total voluntary contribution of Rs 989.7 crore received by the BJP in 2017-18, more than 21 percent or Rs 210 crore is through electoral bonds. Even in terms of the total income of the BJP in 2017-18, more than 20 percent is through electoral bonds. 45 percent of BJP’s income in 2016-17 was from unknown sources as per  . This would further increase in 2017-18 because of the anonymous nature of electoral bonds. None of the national or state parties that have   their annual audit report for 2017-18 have declared any income from electoral bonds. It also has to be noted that the Congress and NCP are the only two national parties that are yet to submit their annual audit report for 2017-18. It is possible that the rest of Rs 12 crore worth electoral bonds have gone to either the Congress or NCP or other state parties. It is also possible that a large part of these electoral bonds may not have gone to any party since   using RTI also revealed that bonds worth Rs 11 crore were not encashed by July 2018.  purchased in all the cycles till October 2018 clearly indicates that there is no demand for bonds of lower denomination. In terms of value, bonds of Rs 1 crore denomination accounted for Rs 782 crore or 89.6 percent followed by bonds of Rs 10 lakh denomination that accounted for Rs 89.6 crore or 10.3 percent. Together, they have accounted for close to 99.9 percent of total value of bonds purchased till date. Even in terms of the number of bonds purchased, 1678 out of the 1795 or 93.5 percent electoral bonds purchased till date are in the denomination of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Though there is no concrete information on the type of purchasers since SBI has refused to share such information, it is highly likely that the Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore denomination are purchased by corporates than individuals.

The controversy comes months after Sidhu was criticised for embracing Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa while the Punjab minister was attending the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Chawla, who heads the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, is a prominent pro-Khalistan voice.

Defending himself, Chawla told  Chawla also added that he clicked pictures with almost everybody present at the event. However, on being asked about the “terror activites” in Punjab, Chawla said, “We don’t support terror.

Singh said that Sidhu did not get back to him on the matter. Earlier in August 2018, when the Punjab Minister hugged Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa, on the sidelines of Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s swearing in, it created a furore, and the Punjab CM criticised Sidhu. The Punjab CM stated, that at a time when the Pakistan Army was killing Indian soldiers, Sidhu’s hug was uncalled for. Sidhu who left the BJP due to his strained ties with the Badal family has been far more aggressive on Sukhbir Singh Badal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, an ally of the BJP) and his brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia, a former Minister in the erstwhile SAD government. Sidhu sought the arrest of Majithia for his alleged links with drug peddlers (the Punjab minister stated that a special task force report set up by the Congress government had sufficient evidence, which pointed to Majithia’s involvement in drug peddling). The Punjab CM, who in his previous tenure went hammer and tongs against the Badals, has been less combative, with many, including his own party men, alleging that he has a tacit understanding with the Badals. Even when the Ranjit Singh Commission report (set up by Captain Amarinder Singh to investigate the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, as well as the death of two peaceful protesters who died as a result of police firing) was tabled in the Punjab assembly, Sidhu took a far stronger line against the Badals, arguing that the report stated that the former CM Parkash Singh Badal had issued firing orders. Captain Amarinder is being hailed for his decision to decline the Pakistani invitation for attending the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Sahib. Captain Singh has cited terrorism emanating from Pakistan, as well as the role of the Pakistani Army in the same as the reason for his decision. Elahi’s family is known for his proximity to the Pakistan Army as well as the ISI. Captain Singh visited Pakistan in 2005 and held the all Punjab games in December 2004. Significantly, during the 1980’s, the Elahi’s had links with a number of Khalistani activists and some analysts had criticised Captain Singh for going overboard in his outreach to Pakistani Punjab inspite of the above factors. Captain Amarinder Singh during his Pakistan visits has also cultivated strong personal friendships with individuals known to have close links with the Pakistani ‘Deep State’. The reasons for Captain Amarinder Singh’s decision to decline the Pakistani invitation thus are not driven solely by any principles or conviction. While Captain Singh’s decision and aggressive statements do no harm to burnish his nationalist credentials and his tough stance when it comes to national security, it is a bit naive to overlook other factors for Singh’s latest moves. One important factor could be that Navjot Singh Sidhu has stolen the limelight in the context of the Kartarpur issue.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals – why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of ‘tribal tourism’ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own ‘Ongan’ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an “Andaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute – ANTRI” in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to “hands off” to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed ‘Restricted Area Permit’ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands which  are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyone’s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

This is a curious call to action because, hopefully, the BJP and RSS know that no law can bypass the Constitution or judicial challenges in courts. And this law in particular – assuming the ruling party will have it passed in both houses of the Parliament – will most certainly be challenged in the Supreme Court. Unless the government seeks to build religious centres for all communities –which, given the political and ideological proclivities of the ruling dispensation, is unimaginable – the law to not only acquire the disputed land for a temple, but also to build it, would run into the headwinds of the constitutional guarantee of  . Gandhi and Sardar Patel supported the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, but not by the government and not by using state funds, despite the fact that the Somnath temple was not disputed in the way the Ram temple is. Secularism of the Indian state approximates more to proximity to all religions, rather than equal distance from all. The state is involved with a number of existing religious practices and institutions, but to pass a law that not only favours the faith of one community over another, but also legitimises retrospectively the assault committed on the faith of a minority community by the destruction of the Babri Masjid, would be to go too far beyond any possible definition of a secular state. We have been here before. The last time the government sought to acquire the land to settle the dispute between territories through the Acquisition of Central Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993, it took the matter (itself) to the Supreme Court in a reference, and declared before it, that it was committed “to the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque”, without specifying exact locations. The matter, at the heart of it, is a land dispute – a fact that is easy to forget in the political and ideological heat that surrounds it. (It is pertinent to remember that what was destroyed on 6 December 1992 was not only the Babri Masjid, but also the Ram Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi, whose existence is historically parallel to the Babri Mosque.) In  , the Supreme Court struck down the aforementioned 1993 Act saying that it was unconstitutional, as it overrode the property rights of the Muslim litigants, acquired according to the latter’s pleadings, through the simple fact that the Babri Masjid had stood on the disputed land at least since the 16th century. In addition, the government would also have to demonstrate that any such acquisition is in public interest – not an easy task, given that acquiring the land to build a Ram temple would favour one religion over another. If the government were to pass another such Act (this time with no proposal to build a mosque, presumably) it will also have to contend with the Places of Worship Act (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of any place of worship, including of course a mosque, as it existed on independence – a fairly fundamental safeguard for a secular state. Until that date, around when Muslims were forcibly stopped from using the mosque, Babri Masjid was a place of worship for the latter, barring the Ram Chabutra, which of course was a Hindu place of worship. It  also easy to forget that there is a criminal case winding its way through the judicial system given that it has been progressing at a pace that would put glaciers to shame. A law of the nature demanded by senior RSS leaders would only further abuse that the trust, and provide state approval and sanction to the demolition. If it comes into force, then the Supreme Court will have to answer if a criminal act can create property and other rights. Given the context, and our institutional and constitutional structure, it is baffling that the RSS is pushing the government to come up with a law to bypass the judiciary. The worst they can do is to keep mounting all kinds of pressure on the judiciary – including, for instance, the sort of vitriolic and personalised attack that Indresh Kumar launched on ‘2-3’ judges in a speech that he delivered on 27 November – and hope that the courts will buckle under pressure. But they cannot stop the law they are demanding from being brought to the courts, and challenged. Further delay means that the issue will remain emotive and eminently exploitable for elections to come but if the RSS’s real intent is to see a Ram temple built on the disputed land, a law passed by the government cannot help them bypass the judiciary. The only way to bypass the judiciary at first pass is to build the temple illegally, and the only way to bypass it altogether, is to change the Constitution to suit their end goal.

I donated it to those families of the farmers that committed suicide. While that went on for a number of years, I realised that the number of people I was benefitting was very small in proportion to the amount of distress there was. So I felt like, why not start a political movement! Something on a larger scale. Now, with the help of the district administration in UP, we identified such farmers and started crowd-funding in those areas. We worked with around 4,300 farmers across districts like Allahabad, Balrampur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur-Khiri. We were very particular about keeping the rate of recidivism low. It should not be like that a person takes the money, reduces or eliminates his debt, and goes on to spend it on his daughter’s marriage and gets back into debt again. This movement gave me a sense that we could see things to their logical conclusion. But again, this scale was very small. I realised that to effect a social transformation, we need to change things at the policy level because that’s the only way things are going to be systemically solved. That’s when I started working on this book. This book has taken me to 11 states, 60 districts to talk about things like water, labour, textile, energy access, agricultural marketing etc.” “You always find a very urban bias towards the fact that the farmer loan waivers have been given. If you look at total farm loan waivers in the country versus industry subsidies, the total farm loan waivers today are exactly 3.6% of the industry subsidies. When we are talking about people who are 70% of the total population, just 3.6%! So exactly which sops are we talking about? The conversation on agriculture these days is almost as if we are doing the farmers a favour, which is completely the other way round. A farmer doing a hectare of paddy or wheat farming earns about Rs 2,500-2,800 per month from that. An agricultural labourer earns about 5000 rupees a month. So a farmer is doing worse than the labour working on his field. How can it be sustainable? No wonder 30 million people in the last five years have left agriculture. 50 million people before that in the last ten years. That’s a lot of people. If it continues down this road, our food security will be threatened. My point is not simply about agriculture. My study is an academic critique of how the village as an economic unit can be viable a 100 years from now. Because if the village doesn’t remain viable then frankly India as a country is going to collapse. The cities cannot bear the burden of internal migration. We need to look at non-farm income, we need to look at textile, handicrafts. India has over 300 handicraft clusters. Why are we not ramping those up? In India one sustainable job in steel costs 24 lakh rupees; 24 jobs are created in textile for 1 lakh rupees. As a country, which one should we be looking at? We have an army of unemployed people, what are we doing?” “When Bombay Presidency was created, the British focused on irrigation in the southern Bombay Presidency, which is the present day Gujarat, and in western Maharashtra of today. But they did very little in what is now Vidarbha because it was largely seen as jungle. Now look at the consequence of something as basic as irrigation. The farmers of Vidarbha have 4% irrigation and they have been reduced to total pauperisation and this region sees the largest rate of farmer suicides in the country. The problems are there but the solutions are not terribly difficult.” “It’s not about the government only. It’s also about the channels in the middle. There is a historical study done in 1972 in then Calcutta, which said that just 2% of the end-user price of an orange reached the farmer because the marketing channels had consumed the majority of the value. Just look at our APMCs, the mandis. Unpaved roads, open spaces. Even today there are no storage facilities, there is no cover. A lot of stuff gets rotten. When you go there it’s almost like a mafia is running it. The farmers are at their mercy. The farmer goes there from his village 7-8 km away in a tractor trolley. Sometimes he stays there for 3-4 days awaiting good price. And then in desperation he sells at whatever price. Even if we do nothing else and just fix the mandis in our country that itself will alleviate and mitigate a lot of farmer distress. “These are very good solutions. Communication and information revolution will help the farmer. The point is, however, how many farmers have the smartphone? Even if they have smartphones they have cheap ones that don’t have enough battery power to run them. The electricity situation is not the best so their phones are not charged half the time. One of the projects that I undertook in Banda was with a group that was doing a lot of great work with information disseminated from Mandya in Karnataka via the mobile. Initially we took 4 villages in Banda and we started sharing this with them and we found that they were resistant. They said, “ ” But when I visited again after three months they were literally looking at their phones for one hour a day to educate themselves. Digital solutions will certainly work but please remember that in India we have gone from medievalism to post-modernism in a record period of time. So, we are living in, simultaneously, two different time zones.” “When talking about dairy, my mother takes the animal rights approach and I see it from purely economic perspective. Now a person engaged in dairy farming will eventually take the animal to the slaughterhouse after its milch phase is over because they can’t afford to keep them. What we need to look at is different systems to keep those creatures relevant for the farmer. In India, we have a desperate need for energy. When LPG cylinders—which are made from crude oil—spike in price they become unaffordable for the last man in society. So, if we can look at gobar gas plants many of our issues are solved. A bovine creature gives about 30-40 kgs of gobar everyday. If we can build localised gobar gas plants in every village and connect them to every house we’d have increased electricity, the tyranny of distance would be less and it would be cheaper. And those animals would always be relevant and therefore lead the life of some dignity.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

These were the words of the   when he promised to personally lead the global body towards greater gender equality. As the world observes the start of ‘16 Days of Activism’ against gender-based violence (from 26 November 2018), an independent United Nations system-wide survey on sexual harassment is taking place around all UN country offices. It is the first of its kind, and it demonstrates the UN’s resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all personnel across its offices. The UN initiative is in lock-step with the theme for this year’s ‘16 Days of Activism’ – ‘Orange the World; Hear Me Too’. The aim is to raise awareness about violence against women and its impact on a woman’s physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The #MeToo movement heralded the coming out of women across various professions and work forces, against their (primarily) male perpetrators, breaking a decades-old silence that they were previously compelled to live with. Statistics indicate that more than one in three women across the world have experienced physical or sexual violence, usually perpetrated by an intimate partner. In a   by Edison Research and Marketplace on sexual harassment, 27 percent of women and 14 percent of men reported that they had been harassed at some time at their workplace. Despite the progressive policy commitments and institutional frameworks on gender equality and women empowerment, implementation remains slow and inconsistent. While the   campaign has gained high momentum since its launch in September 2014, a lot still needs to be done to bring men on board in addressing sexual harassment towards women in public and private spaces. Such campaigns have brought considerable gains towards raising consciousness and self-assurance for women. Increasingly, they are speaking out against the indignities of work-related sexual advances and intimidation. This is the cost that countries are paying when women and girls are denied the chance to live to their full social and economic potential. Consider the aspect of employment: according to a World Bank   released this year, countries are losing USD 160 trillion in wealth because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men. This amounts to an average of USD 23,620 for each person. In India, reports indicate that every 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of domestic violence. In a country where physical and psychological abuse is all pervasive and rampant, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has done little to alleviate gender-based discrimination and violence. The Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office that has more than 10 employees of any gender. However, a   done some years back found that 7 in 10 working women did not report workplace harassment, demonstrating a disturbing lack of confidence in the system. By one  , gender inequality may have reduced India’s economic growth by almost 4 percent annually over the past 10 years. . It is estimated that 27 percent of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. It is said that the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25 percent increase in wages. In addition, ensuring that all girls get at least secondary education in India, would reduce child marriages by more than half. All these demonstrate the cyclical benefits, from one generation to the next, of education as an intervention strategy. However, while evidence abounds that parity with women is the best driving force for economic growth, wealth creation and poverty eradication, women’s rights are being “reduced, restricted and reversed”, according to UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres. There cannot be any illusions about the enormity of the task ahead. Misogyny is a deep-rooted expression of male entitlement that often excuses sexual harassment and violence, even at times by the survivors themselves. Women shouldn't have to feel 'grateful' for opportunities, says the UN DSG Amina Mohammed in a  . So true. Ultimately, countries need to begin breaking structural barriers, not just with gender equality as a lofty ideal but as a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. ’s (What does the first-time woman voter want?

I have requested that voting time in these polling booths should be extended to compensate for the delay,” he said. He also took to Twitter to appeal for non-partial voting. According to CNN-News18, Congress leader Kamal Nath wants re-polling to take place in some constituencies. Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat, commenting on the faulty EVM issue, said that there are provisions in place for such matters which do not necessarily need the Commission’s intervention. “There are provisions for the extension of time, the local officers can take the call as they see fit. The matter does not need to be handled by the commission,” he said. While two faulty EVMs in Ujjain were replaced, 11 VVPAT machines in Alirajpur, five VVPAT and two EVMs in Burhanpur were also replaced, according to ANI. Voting took place across 230 constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, where the Congress is looking to topple the incumbent Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government. As many as 1.80 lakh security personnel have been deployed to maintain peace and ensure free and fair voting during the polls.

Hluna also flagged BJP's 'Hindutva' image as a big liability. In a candid interview with  , which was published on the day the state went to polls, on Wednesday, 28 November, Hluna said that from Modi to Shah, no national BJP leader had put in the slightest effort in the pre-election campaign. He also said that they didn’t give the state enough importance. Adding to this, he said, the biggest problem the party faced in the state, was carrying the tag of  . According to Hluna, people in Mizoram – a predominantly Christian state – have in the past opposed the BJP, as they believe that the party would persecute Christians, should they be voted to power, the  report read. Despite this, Hluna told the news agency that he was fairly confident of the BJP bagging the highest number of seats in the Assembly elections, voting for which began on Wednesday, 28 November. He said the people wanted change and development, which the BJP could give them, the report added. Hluna told the news agency that he didn’t think that Modi, Shah and the party’s other central leaders had made enough of an effort for the pre-election campaign in Mizoram, as they had only sent one lawmaker and not visited any constituency themselves. He further said that since Hindi or English isn’t the first language of the Mizo people, the party’s central leadership did not have that much effect on them. Another point he brought up, was the lack of funds and lack of power that the state party was being given by its central leadership. “They should give us more money so that we can run things on our own. But there is no money, we are very poor. If there is a lot of money, we can do well,” he told  . To Hluna, the BJP’s greatest challenge to coming into power, was being perceived as a pro-Hindutva outfit, which would persecute those belonging to the Christian faith, the report stated. However, he added that it would be a Christian BJP candidate from Mizoram, who would come to power, if the BJP won the elections. Hence, he said, this is why people shouldn’t think against voting for the BJP, the report stated. Despite his problem with the central leadership of the BJP and the party’s “Hindutva” image in the state, Hluna told  that he was fairly confident and optimistic about its win in the elections. The reason, he said, was because people were fed up with the Congress rule under Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla and that they wanted change and development- which the state party under Narendra Modi’s guidance, would be able to give them. He also said that if the Congress, MNF and other parties were unable to form the new government independently, he was confident that their lawmakers would join the BJP, which, he claimed, would win the maximum seats in the elections, the report said.

The possibility of a “weak and unstable” coalition would be a matter of concern for foreign investors, Jonathan Schiessl, fund manager at Ashburton, said in an interview with BloombergQuint.

Ajay Srivastava, managing director of Dimensions Consulting, said it doesn’t matter which party comes to power as investors are the lowest priority for political parties. Moreover, he said, coalition governments are more likely to take responsible decisions because survival is at stake. People across 679 assembly seats (66 Lok Sabha constituencies) will vote in multiple phases and results will be out on 11 December. Marketmen said it will be like a report card for Modi’s performance in the last four-and-a-half years.

He had supported the idea of joint polls before suddenly declaring early polls in Telangana and, as recently as August 2018, KCR had sent out indications that he is even open to a possible post-poll tie up with the BJP. But there seems to be a twist in that “friendly” tale with the BJP, and in the last three days, the Telangana campaign has been dominated by an acerbic  , in an exchange of statements and allegations. Hitting back at Modi, KCR, speaking at a rally in Mahbubnagar, alleged that the prime minister was “spreading lies for votes” and even referred to him as a “foolish” prime minister. He further stated that he was “not scared” of the prime minister like his political rivals. Firstly, KCR’s principal rival in the state is the Congress party and hence it is necessary for him to have a cordial equation with the BJP. Further, Telangana as a newly-formed state is heavily dependent on the Centre and hence, he needs a good equation with the prime minister. This population is not just centred around Hyderabad city where it even has a majority in some assembly seats, but is spread across the state and can be decisive in districts like Nizamabad or even KCR’s bastion Mahbubnagar. KCR and the TRS seem to have a friendly equation with the most powerful voice of the Muslims in the state, the All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, but there is no open alliance with the MIM and there are fears that Muslim voters may alienate the TRS as it is being seen as close to the BJP. There are also serious doubts over KCR’s gamble of calling for an early election. Ground reports indicate that the Congress has regrouped itself, and the alliance it has formed with the Telugu Desam Party, Left and the Telanagana Jana Samithi has formidable arithmetic on the ground. The combined vote share of the allies was nearly 40 percent in 2014 when the TRS managed to win just over half the seats with 34 percent vote share. The political dynamics seem to lend weight to the Congress’s allegation that the rivalry between KCR and the prime minister is ostensible. However, the fact that the TRS has an alliance with the MIM, which is formidable in Hyderabad, is a headache for the Congress. TRS leaders also point out that the TDP had an open alliance with the BJP before shifting sides, and hence, the Congress’s grand alliance (Maha Kootami as it is called in Telugu) is an alliance of opportunity and not one of values. But, in all this, what’s there for the BJP? Firstly, the Bharatiya Janata Party clearly hopes for a Congress defeat in Telangana. As a party, its stakes are minimal in the assembly polls, and hence, its ideal result would be a TRS win. However, in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP desperately needs allies in the south of India, and TRS is a potential candidate. But BJP leaders insist that they want to create an independent identity in the state and the prime minister targeting KCR is a message, that the party cannot be taken lightly by regional players. Finally, the nature of the attacks the two leaders made against each other was fierce and personal, and the language suggests that it needs to be taken seriously. But then, real life politics is stranger than fiction, and the sharper an exchange, the stronger the perception of being rivals!         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

For a western mind hooked on the idea that all parts of the planet including the remote polar regions can be penetrated and conquered easily, the idea seemed preposterous – almost archaic – that a handful of men could kill an individual with just a bow and arrow. But here’s what the headlines are not telling you. This incident is in fact symptomatic of some of the broader changes being initiated on the island to overthrow a decades old ‘hands off’ policy, and open up the chain of islands like a box of chocolates for real estate and tourism sharks to bite into. Earlier, permission had to be taken for tourists to travel to these areas, most of which were off-limit in the past. And there are other plans afoot, courtesy a special committee appointed to review the current laws related to India’s coastline, that will introduce a slew of policy measures endangering not just the tribal islanders, but also stress the fragile ecology here. First, it’s important to understand why the islands are so special and why the Indian government followed a policy of protectionism in the past. Just 37 of the group of 572 islands, are permanently inhabited, by a mix of indigenous tribes and Indians (the latter were brought here as prisoners of the British, after the First War of Independence in 1857). The Nicobar Islands are home to two 'Mongloid' tribes – the Shompen and Nicobarese. The 'Negrito' tribes are believed to have arrived in the islands from Africa up to 60,000 years ago. All are nomadic hunter-gatherers, hunting wild pig and monitor lizard, and catching fish with bows and arrows. They also collect honey, roots and berries from the forest. Some of the Nicobarese people do some form of cultivation, and are also involved in what are considered ‘mainstream’ jobs. Each of these tribal groups have faced an onslaught from outsiders;  Great Andamanese for instance today number just 43. The tribe that has suffered most from contact with outsiders: 99 percent have been wiped out since the British first colonized the islands, the Onges number just 100 – their forest home has been plundered over the years by poachers and loggers. Then there is the Sentinelese, the ones that Chau sought to ‘befriend’ – their population estimated at 50-100. They are the most isolated of all the tribes – they have no peaceful contact with outsiders, and it is said – they fire warning arrows at those who approach. The islands also boast of a rich biodiversity. Of the 9,000 species recorded here, over a 1,000 are endemic, which means they are found just here and NOWHERE else in the world. A great example is the majestic Narcondam hornbill found on the island by the same name, the Andaman Day Gecko and the Andaman woodpecker. The islands themselves are considered a global biodiversity hotspot but threats are always looming large from ill-planned developers and commercial interests. Now take a look at the plans in store that will most certainly flatten out biodiversity as well as endanger the tribal groups here. The Draft Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2018 was introduced based on recommendations from the ‘Shailesh Nayak Committee’ report. This new draft permits the opening up of ecologically important inter-tidal zones, to destructive and polluting activities. A conglomerate of scientists and lawyers working on coastal issues wrote to the Environment Minister Dr Harshvardhan in October, red flagging some of the decisions being taken, along with sending a detailed critique to the policy makers. Sweeping changes have been made in the earlier law referred to as the Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2011, that now allows developers of shopping and housing complexes, hotels and entertainment complexes to walk in, thus diluting safeguards in place before. These are broad and open-ended phrases that are open to interpretation, thus opening the floodgates for the entry of many detrimental activities as ‘permissible’ ones. Another concern that has been red flagged by biologists is the arbitrary classification of ecologically sensitive areas. “Eco-tourism” activities have been allowed in the ecologically sensitive areas of what is referred to as ‘ICRZ I-A’- these include areas such as coral reefs, mangroves and sand dunes, which are not only ecologically sensitive, but are also critical for the survival of the islands as they buffer the islands against socio-ecological pressures and disasters. Many ecosystems such as rocky beaches, areas with high biodiversity, fish breeding and spawning areas etc. have been left out of this notification even though they are crucial for the islands. The Andaman and Nicobar and the Lakshadweep have unique geological history, and their coasts are influenced by a combination of tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric and ecological processes. Not only are they different from the coast of the mainland, they are also particularly fragile and vulnerable to climate change. The draft ICRZ notification 2018 does not take into account these particularities of the island ecosystem. Even habitats frequented by the critically endangered species like the sea cow or the Dugong has not been spared. Inter-tidal areas are also important feeding sites for dugongs, as they may contain sea grass species that are preferred. Dugongs are highly endangered species, with less than 50 individuals left in the Indian Ocean, and facing a rapid decline of population, and their conservation must be a priority. Disturbance of such areas through activities permitted above or accidents such as oil spills may be the death knell for these animals and may lead to local extinction. Biologists working on the islands have urged that the protective safeguards in the 2011 Notification should be retained. With these sweeping changes being introduced in government policy, the ethereal beauty and uniqueness of the Andaman and Nicobar islands could be lost forever. It is but sad that the Sentinelese had to take it upon them to protect their island. In this day when social media is the beast, this ‘primitive’ tribal group has managed, with just a bow and arrow, to send a message to the entire world – leave our land and forest alone.

The torpedoing of Manafort's plea deal, disclosed in  on Monday, 26 November, also results in special counsel Robert Mueller's team losing a cooperating witness from the top of Donald Trump's presidential campaign who was present for several key episodes under investigation. That includes a Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer he was told had derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton. The move signals a return to the acrimonious relationship Manafort has had with the special counsel's office since his indictment last year. Before his plea agreement, Manafort aggressively challenged the special counsel's legitimacy in court, went through a bitter trial and landed himself in jail after prosecutors discovered he had attempted to tamper with witnesses in his case. Prosecutors said they will detail the \"nature of the defendant's crimes and lies\" in writing at a later date to the judge. Through his attorneys, Manafort denied lying, saying he \"believes he provided truthful information\" during a series of sessions with Mueller's investigators. He also disagreed that he breached his plea agreement. Still, both sides now agree they can't resolve the conflict, and US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson should set a date to sentence him. Manafort, who remains jailed, had been meeting with the special counsel's office since he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He cut that deal to head off a second trial after being convicted last summer of eight felony counts related to millions of dollars he hid from the IRS in offshore accounts. Both cases stemmed from his Ukrainian political work and undisclosed lobbying work he admitted to carrying out in the US in violation of federal law. As part of his plea agreement, Manafort pledged to “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly” with the government “in any and all matters” prosecutors deemed necessary. That included his work on the Trump campaign as well as his Ukrainian political work, which remains under investigation by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors there are   the conduct of longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and former Republican congressman and lobbyist Vin Weber to determine whether they violated federal law by failing to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. None of the men has been charged with any crimes. But with prosecutors saying he breached the agreement, Manafort now faces serious repercussions such as the possibility of prosecution on additional charges including the 10 felony counts prosecutors dropped when he made the deal. Manafort already faces up to five years in prison on the two charges in his plea agreement. In his separate Virginia case, Manafort's potential sentencing under federal guidelines has not yet been calculated, but prosecutors have previously said he could face as much as 10 years in prison on those charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in that case in February. His co-defendant Rick Gates, who spent a longer time on the campaign and worked on the Trump inaugural committee, has not had a sentencing date set yet. He continues to cooperate with Mueller.

They will seek this mandate at a meeting in Patiala next month, a press release said. Khaira and seven other Aam Aadmi Party MLAs rebelled in July when the party replaced him as Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly. Bholath MLA Khaira and Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu were then suspended from the party. Khaira said they will start an eight-day long 'Insaaf' march from 8 December to seek justice in cases related to the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. The 180-km long march from Talwandi Sabo will end in a huge public meeting in Patiala on 16 December, he said. They will seek a mandate then from the people to form a third alternative in Punjab to contest the Lok Sabha elections, Khaira said. The Insaaf Party headed by Bains has two MLAs in the assembly. Khaira also lashed at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, accusing him of denying justice in the sacrilege case and the police firing in Faridkot district in 2015. Not even a constable has been punished for killing two people in the Behbal Kalan firing, he said.

When she was born, India was under British occupation and World War 1 had just concluded. You might say, look at how the imagination of the world has changed in this time. Gandhi was only just getting his non-cooperation movement started. People in her part of the world in rural Maharashtra didn’t have bicycles or electricity or cameras. She would tell you, in these hundred years, what has altered most significantly is this: When she was a child, if you grew food, it was an absolute guarantee you would not starve. Now, in 2018, if you are a farmer, it is almost certain you will. And so, it is that at the age of one hundred that she walked from her village Baradi in Nandurbar district for ten kilometres to get to the nearest town from where she got into a shared taxi. From there to the train in the next town, and then another train, and after nearly twenty hours of continuous and taxing travel, she arrived in Mumbai, to join thousands of protesting farmers demanding many things, but essentially one thing — the right to live. It’s ridiculous that they grow food for the rest of the country to eat but are so consumed by debt from crop failure and no means to buy expensive fertilizer or even more expensive diesel for their tractors. “Enough is enough,” Jijabai and many others from her village said. This year has been a particularly bad crop in her district. The yield was half what it was from last year. Her children and grand-children all work as daily wagers on other farms and on road and building projects and still it’s hard to find enough to eat. Things are in fact so impossible that Jijabai decided to put herself and her tired body though this agonizing journey to make her voice count. Even though she was just a speck – one of the thousands of people to have arrived at Mumbai’s Azan Maidan on 21 November, ahead of the long march to Delhi – she considered it vital enough for her to be there. On that day, Sachinbhai — a leader from the Lok Sangharsh Morcha in Maharasthra said Jijabai woke up at 4 am with the others. And since the participation was entirely voluntary, most people, including Jijabai didn’t have anything to eat all day. She had her first cup of chai after noon. But there was fire in her belly. With the system weighed so heavily against them, farmers across the country are preparing to be in Delhi’s Ramlila maidan on 29 and 30 November, demanding that a special session of parliament be convened to raise crucial survival issues. Her voice was barely audible after a day at the rally. “Sorry, I’ve lost my voice,” she said, apologetic, but happy to see the issue get some traction. At the other end of the country, K Balakrishnan from the ‘Jai Kisan Andolan’ and Convener of the Tamil Nadu farmers’ agitation, said even rich farmers are in distress with cyclone Gaja having destroyed their crop. This is why crop insurance, the guarantee of a minimum support price from the state, and the allotment of land promised to tribals is crucial, he explained. And in the case of farmers reeling from the effects of the cyclone, compensation that hasn’t still been given. Ramesh Chander from Jind in Haryana, echoes these sentiments. He also added that this government has been particularly harsh on farmers. Until 2014, there was at least a minimum guarantee of 50-55 days of daily wages under the MNREGA scheme. Now, in the non-agricultural season, there is no guarantee of getting daily wage work. And the supplementary income from the sale of cattle once it’s past its prime has stopped, thanks to the cow vigilante groups, he added. “The rate of purchase of milk has dropped and I can’t sell my buffalo either,” Chander lamented. Adding that farmers groups – 200 of them were also being strategic in the timing of their agitation. “Yeh election ka saal hai, this is an election season.” He’s lost 30,000 rupees this agricultural season, and if he doesn’t join the tidal wave of voices now, it will be a big opportunity lost. His survival could be at stake. Avik Saha, Organising Secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination group or the AIKSCC summed it up in a catch-phrase he has coined for the march – “Modi Ko Harao, Rahul Ko Darao” (Remove Modi, Scare Rahul). “Our job,” he clarified, “is to make it impossible to ignore farmers.” The politics of the movement is absolutely transparent. They would like to build pressure on the Modi government at a time when they are aware it is facing the heat on every front. And they would like to extract these basic promises ahead of the 2019 elections. The long-term goal is to build the 200 farmers groups that have signed on into a collective block. Lingraj, a farmers’ activist from Odisha, said his organisation doesn’t have money. So about a thousand farmers from that state will travel by train, unreserved. “You can classify the farmers by the routes they take from different parts of the country,” Avik Saha remarked. Farmers from Bihar and Odisha can only travel unreserved, but in Karnataka, there are some who will be flying in. For now, they have nothing to hold onto but their dissent. Farming is all that Jijabai knows. At a hundred plus years, she would like to be able to hold on to that one basic thing – the right to grow food and for it to be sustainable.  ‘     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Most likely not. But apparently, as per the doctor minister, the same may not be true for forest cover, especially the type of forest and forest cover density — important parametres for assessing the health of our forests, the country’s veritable lungs that keep us alive. On Monday, February 12, 2018, the doctor and his team that released the India State of Forest Report 2017, patted their backs for an apparent increase in the forest and tree cover only and largely chose to ignore the weak points as large parts of India lost very dense forests, as was evident from comparison with the previous assessment.   ** The total forest cover as per current assessment is 7,08,273 sqkm, which is 21.54 per cent of the geographic area of the country. ** The tree cover is estimated to be 93,815 sqkm (9.38 million ha), which is 2.85 per cent of the geographical area. ** The total forest and tree cover is 8,02,088 sqkm (80.20 million ha), which is 24.39 per cent of the geographical area. ** There has been an increase of 6,778 sqkm of forest cover at the national level. (After considering the changes during two assessments – 2015 (updated) and 2017). ** Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala have contributed by an increase of 2,141 sqkms, 1,101 sqkm and 1,043 sqkm, respectively. ** There is an increase of 1,243 sqkm in tree cover compared to the 2015 assessment. But a closer look at the  tells us that not all forests are healthy. It sounds more like number jugglery. Even when very dense forest (VDF), that is all land with tree canopy density of 70 per cent and above, increased by 9,525 sqkm from 2015 to 2017, the moderately dense forest (MDF), that is all lands with tree canopy density of 40 per cent and more but less than 70 per cent, decreased by 4,421sqkm. States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have shown decrease in the VDF category. In the MDF category, it is the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Uttarakhand, West Bengal that have shown a negative change. A footnote for Jammu and Kashmir in all cases and for Odisha at another place just add to the gloomy picture. For Jammu and Kashmir, the note reads “includes Jammu and Kashmir area outside LoC that is under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China”. For Odisha, in the table showing “Recorded Forest Areas (RFAs) in States and UTs”, a footnote mentions: “RF (reserved forest) in Odisha includes 9,175 sqkms of proposed RF, PF (protected forest) includes 15,117 sqkms revenue forest/deemed forest and 191 sqkms of private forest.” Bah! So much for quality of forests! As rightly pointed out by this June 2016  titled “Why Defining a 'Forest' in India Is Harder Than It Sounds (And Why That Matters)”, the “Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has been involved in a tussle with the Tribal Affairs Ministry over the question of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) as well as the rights of forest-based communities. The Environment Ministry has been an instrumental part of this battle by reinterpreting the FRA and paving the road to doing away with consent, on multiple levels, from ‘gram sabhas’ (village-level governments) before chopping down India’s traditional forests”. The debate is not settled yet. What is more is minister Harsh Vardhan said, “We are 10th in the list of top forest cover countries. When the world over, there has been a decreasing trend in forest cover, India has witnessed an increase. The other nine countries have a population density of about 150 persons compared to India’s 350 (population density). This is important.” But as is very clear from a   by D Venkateswarlu, an IFS officer from Jharkhand, as part of his assignment for his course at TERI University, each country has its own definitions of what constitutes forests. The European Commission has defined forestland as having at least 20 per cent canopy closure (10 per cent in the Mediterranean forests) and a minimum area of 0.5 ha (1 ha = 0.01Sq. KM); Brazil defines forest as an area of land greater than one hectare, with more than 30 per cent canopy cover and a minimum tree height of five metres; USA’s Forest Service says forest land includes land at least 10 per cent of which is stocked by trees of any size, or land formerly having had such tree cover that will be naturally or artificially regenerated; Canada says forest land is constituted by areas of land where tree canopies cover more than 10 per cent of the total area and the trees, when mature, can grow to a height of more than five metres. China, on the other hand, says forest is “a land having a minimum area 0.67 ha, minimum crown cover of 20 per cent and a minimum tree height of two metres”. Clearly, even when India finds a place amid the first 10 countries, by definition, our forests do not compare qualitatively with other forests. But this fact about what is it that they call a forest does not find mention in the current report. Most worrisome is the situation in high altitudes and northeastern areas: ** The total forest cover in the northeastern region is 171306 sqkm, which is 65.34 per cent of its geographical area in comparison to the national forest cover of 21.54 per cent. ** The current assessment shows a decrease of forest cover to the extent of 630 sqkms in the NE region. ** All altitude zones above 1,000 metres (approximately 3,800 feet) have registered a small decrease in forest cover as against those below 1,000 metres, which show an increase. As many as six states of the northeastern region showed a negative change as compared to 2015 assessment. Arunachal Pradesh (-190), Meghalaya (-116), Mizoram (-531), Nagaland (-450), Sikkim (-9) and Tripura (-164) showed negative change while only Assam and Manipur showed positive changes. When it came to the alarmingly decreasing numbers from the northeastern states, Dr Harsh Vardhan said: “The NE already has 70 per cent of forest cover. We will go into the nitty-gritty and look into the reasons and all positive, corrective measures would be taken.”He also said, “We will treat it as a blessing in disguise and deal with it accordingly.” But then, neither did the minster nor the Forest Survey of India (FSI)  have a clear idea as to what could be the exact reason. Saibal Dasgupta, DG, FSI, said, “Jhoom cultivation can be one of the reasons for the decrease in forest cover in the NE. We will try to increase the livelihood options (for the people of the NE).” When asked if the increasing rate of development projects in the northeast that need cutting down or drowning of forest – such as highways, hydropower projects or industries, could be a reason – the officer, however, said the department did not have segregated data on diverted forest land and land under jhoom cultivation. The picture is especially scary as most of the forests in the hill states of northeast belong to indigenous communities, leading to the obvious question: who is usurping them? Now, to understand what “a small decrease in forest cover” means: (Forest cover in Altitude zones (Area in sqkm)) Clearly, what the report and even the minister termed as “small decrease” for areas above 1,000 metres (3,800 feet and above) is not as small as they want you to believe. The areas above 4,000 feet are the Himalayan ranges that give birth to the majority of our rivers. Forests are vital for the survival of these rivers and the negative decrease (- 217, -193, -76 and -99) for all ranges above 1,000 metres should set the alarm bells ringing in the Himalayan states. They are already bearing the brunt of climate change witnessing decreased snowfall in winters, increased temperatures and drier atmosphere every passing year. Water bodies inside forests and bamboo find a separate mention in the India State of Forests Report 2017 for the first time. Acknowledging that “forests play a vital role in water conservation and improve the water regime in the area”, different state forest departments besides plantation and protection also undertake steps to improve water conservation through different interventions such as building check dams, vegetation barriers, percolation ponds, contour trenches etc under various central and state government schemes. As per the latest assessment based on comparison of satellite images from 2005 and 2015, water bodies inside forest cover have increased by 2,647 sqkm during the last decade. Maharashtra (432 sqkm), Gujarat (428 sqkm) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sqkm) are the top three states that have seen a spike in water bodies within forest areas. Nearly all the states have shown progress in terms of the growth of water bodies, the report said. After recently changing the definition of bamboo as “grass”, compared to the earlier definition of “tree”, the government plans to emphasise more on bamboo’s ecological and economic value. For the first time, bamboo finds mention as a separate chapter of India State of Forest Report 2017 even though it was always an integral part of National Forest Inventory. Instead of regular comparison with 2015 data, as done in other cases, for bamboo, the report compares earlier estimates of 2011. As per those estimates, the total bamboo bearing area in the country has increased by 1.73 million ha. At the national level, the total number of culms has been estimated to be 28,103 million. As compared to the estimate of ISFR 2011, there is an increase about 19 million tonnes equivalent green weight of bamboo observed in the present assessment.","date":"2018-02-13","tag":"Ecology,India,Forests","title":"How the quality of India's forests — especially in hills — is suffering","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-forest-report-climate-change-ecology-ministry-of-forests-and-environment/story/1/22336.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15275},{"author":"Arindam De","content":"So Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks that north Indians are \"scum of the earth\"?

The north Indian states are responsible for the problems that Goa has today. The people coming from those states actually want to recreate Haryana in Goa. “Today we have almost six times population of Goa coming as tourists... Those tourists are not top-end tourists, they are also the scum of the earth.\"  According to Sardesai, the heavy influx of north Indian tourists was making it difficult for the state to address the issue of garbage. Well, the only thing infuriated north Indians and Goa aficionados can say is that the   shows the minister needs to clear the cobwebs from his head. Ruling coalitions across the country, in their bid to cling on to power, often enlist individuals or organisations that show scant respect for the country and its citizens. Nor do they respect the ideals that define the leading party. Such elements are neither friends nor allies, but opportunists. (Sardesai's Goa Forward Party is a coalition partner in the BJP-led government.)    It's true that on an average, a foreign tourist does spend almost two-and-a-half times the amount spent by an ordinary domestic tourist. But ministers blaming fellow countrymen or even foreign migrants for ruining their state is not just unfair but uncalled for. In June 2016, the then deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza had said that migrants are responsible for the  . Of course, he was echoing the feelings of the then CM Laxmikant Parsekar who blamed Nigerians for their lifestyle and attitude. Their statements had seen the opposition calling out the BJP-led government's bias towards Africans. It is not a secret that the foreign drug lords have been operating with impunity in Goa. Once limited to the north, the drug menace has spread to south Goa too, and intel reports suggest that the drug net is only expanding in the area. Of course, this is not to say that all   are responsible for it, but the fact that   himself has spoken on the issue deserves some attention. But can people like Sardesai blame north Indians for \"all the problems that Goa is facing today\"? What about his \"foreign and high-end tourists\"? As for the minister's other statement that north Indians are gobbling up everything - land and properties - I have this to say. Well, they indeed are because everything is up for grabs. Goa is a beautiful place and whatever is on sale - land and property - will be bought. Domestic tourists are not   land from Goans. No one from Haryana is pushing Goans out of their properties. On the contrary, people are buying properties in Goa at prices usually higher than what the locals would pay.  That an NDA ally deems it right to say that \" \" coming to Goa are ruining the paradise that Goa is, it is not just an insult to the poor but north Indian members of Sardesai's coalition partner, BJP, too.","date":"2018-02-10","tag":"Vijai Sardesai,North Indians,Tourists,Goa","title":"Why Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks poor domestic tourists are ‘scum of the earth’","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/goa-minister-vijai-sardesai-domestic-north-indian-tourists-scum-of-earth-parrikar-drugs/story/1/22295.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15276},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"There was a reason why  , without making any direct reference to actor-turned-Congress leader Divya Spandana's tweet on the prime minister, made his point clear by saying that character assassination of any individual was not right. At a public meeting in Bangalore last week, Narendra Modi had said farmers were his \"top priority\" and went on to expand \"TOP\" as tomato, onion, potato. In response,  , alias Ramya, took a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on \"POT\", which was seen as a reference to cannabis. (She is the head of Congress social media cell.)  A subsequent clarification that she meant \"POT\" - potato, onion, tomato - understandably did not find many takers, and the BJP went on the offensive claiming the tweet was derogatory to the PM. Siddaramaiah said, \"I have countered Modi's allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally.\"  Ahead of the elections in Karnataka, this is one of the main worries for the Congress. It wants to avoid any Congress leader doing a Mani Shankar Aiyar and give Modi the opening he is looking for. In Aiyar, Modi has had a dependable electoral \"ally\". During the Gujarat election campaigning, Modi exploited the dinner Aiyar had hosted for his Pakistani guests and suggested that the Indian guests, which included former prime minister Manmohan Singh, were hatching a conspiracy. When Aiyar called Modi a \"neech aadmi\" to accuse him of playing dirty politics, Modi said it was a casteist slur and alleged Aiyar had gone to Pakistan to offer \"supari\" for him. In 2014, Aiyar had inadvertently helped the BJP to go on the offensive when he smugly offered space for Modi to set up a tea stall. Modi went to town, interpreting it as an insult to his past vocation, and the arrogance of the party [Congress] in power. Ever since he took charge of the party, Rahul Gandhi has maintained that he and his party will follow a certain propriety even when mud is thrown at rivals in the heat and dust of elections. There is no booklet available that lists out the dos and don'ts, but it seems in the Congress book, everyone but Modi is fair game. So the name of Arun Jaitley can be changed by Gandhi to  . The BJP has returned the compliment by branding the Siddaramaiah government a 10 per cent government, insinuating that it is corrupt. This reluctance to attack the PM at a personal level is more to do with fear factor than real respect. Political strategists point out the example of Arvind Kejriwal who at one point in time, would not tire of dragging Modi into just about every issue concerning Delhi. So much so that it started to look like the Delhi CM suffered from a Modi-phobia. And the more he attacked the PM, his own stature started diminishing with even those who had voted him to power in Delhi, asking why he does not let his work do the talking instead of venting his spleen through Twitter everyday. Which is why it will be interesting to note how the Siddaramaiah versus Modi battle plays out on Twitter. For the past one week, the Karnataka CM has taken on the PM, countering his allegations with facts. This has BS Yeddyurappa, the BJP's chief ministerial face, feeling left out as he expected Karnataka to be a Yeddyurappa versus Siddaramaiah fight. On numerous occasions, he has tried to draw the CM into an argument by responding to his tweets. Siddaramaiah's effort to target Modi directly runs the risk of going wrong for two reasons. One, people like to see a battle between equals, and it would seem that Siddaramaiah is punching above his weight by taking on the PM. Two, it will take just one slip by Siddaramaiah for his rivals, including Modi, to use that to counter attack him. Similarly, the approach of actor Prakash Raj is fraught with risk. For the past many months, Raj has been speaking out against both Modi and Amit Shah, accusing them of being anti-Hindu. If Raj campaigns against right-wing hardline elements in Karnataka, as he may do, it will obviously be seen as helping the Congress. It is a double-edged sword as any kind of vitriol that is seen as a personal attack, could boomerang. It is here that the Nitish Kumar strategy is spoken of as a better template. He made the Bihar 2015 election as a \"Bihari versus Bahari\" duel, positioning himself and Lalu Yadav as sons of the soil versus the two outsiders in Modi and Amit Shah. So Siddaramaiah's emphasis on Kannadiga pride as a counterpoint to the nationalistic approach of BJP, would be a better electoral ploy. Karnataka has always been seen by the BJP as its gateway to south India. The party made a mess of the chance it got in 2008, with Yeddyurappa who was the CM, getting embroiled in corruption cases. It would now want to make amends. With Karnataka being the largest state under Congress control, the stakes are high for both the parties. Enough reason for politicians to stoop as low.  ","date":"2018-02-10","tag":"Karnataka,Divya Spandana,Rahul Gandhi,Congress","title":"In Karnataka, no one dares to upset Modi, not even Congress","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-congress-rahul-gandhi-karnataka-siddaramaiah-arun-jaitley-divya-spandana/story/1/22296.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15277},{"author":"Omair Ahmad","content":"The recent Gujarat state elections were marked by the BJP and its supporters campaigning against Muslims, and the Congress  . The one candidate who did speak on this issue was  , an independent candidate supported by the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, fighting for a seat reserved for Dalits. Weeks ago in  , Uttar Pradesh, as rioters disrupted a Republic Day hoisting of flags by Muslims and called them “Pakistanis”, the one legislator to raise the issue as one of fundamental rights was  , representing a regional party with one MP in the Lok Sabha. His ability to influence national politics is next to non-existent. The marginalisation of Muslims in national politics is almost complete. Their position is that of the eternal stuffed toy, to be vilified at will, with almost no legislator willing to speak of the fundamental right to life of more than 170 million people in the world’s largest democracy. The virtual political disenfranchisement of Muslims in India is a corrosive problem, with potentially catastrophic impact on Indian democracy, but there are no Muslim political leaders of note to address this. At such points, there is the usual lament about the fact that Muslims have not been able to produce a leader of the calibre of Abdul Kalam Azad, India’s first education minister, and who was elected to the post of President of the Indian National Congress, on par with Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. What these lamentations ignore is that Azad was a politician of pre-Partition India. The loss of the large Muslim population in Punjab and East Pakistan/Bangladesh meant that the national base of Muslim politics was vastly reduced after Independence. The Muslims who would have voted for the Congress and a Congress Muslim – bear in mind that in the 1937 elections, the Congress won 25 of the 59 seats reserved for Muslims, including all 15 from the then-North West Frontier Province – were gone (the Unionist Party in undivided Punjab won 101 seats, almost on par with the Muslim League total of 106, and its base was largely the part now in Pakistan). They had to, and still do, navigate politics in different states. With the loss of large mass bases, Partition meant that there was literally no state in the Indian Union where Muslims accounted for a majority, apart from Jammu & Kashmir. Given that J&K accounts for one per cent of the Indian population, and the role of Chief Minister of J&K has basically been reduced to asking, “How high?” when the Centre says, “Jump”, its impact on national politics is hardly worth considering. In the rest of India, the chance of a Muslim party dominating a state, or even playing a major part in its politics, was doomed from the start. In the first-past-the-post elections that we have (we can see from Germany or South Africa that proportional representation better manages diverse polities), a candidate usually needs between 30 to 35 percent of the vote-share to win. There are almost no constituencies in India where Muslims have that much of the population, even if they were not factionalised among themselves to begin with. Lastly is the issue of finance. After Partition, not only did Muslims no longer have a mass base, they lost many of their most prosperous community members, with only a very few of the elite remaining. These were deeply disconnected from the conditions and concerns of, and often in exploitative relationships with, their poorer brethren. Today, if Muslims are found on the national landscape, their wealth is largely tied to the arts – and the  like Aamir Khan or Shah Rukh Khan when they question anti-Muslim rhetoric or actions highlight exactly how precarious their position is, despite their fame or success. Given these conditions, post-Independence Muslim politics has been dominated by two types of Muslims, the “sarkari mussalman”, who kowtowed to the ruling dispensation in return for a share of the spoils, or the “unlettered mullah”, who spoke of Muslim concerns as religious difference, as distinct from the national agenda. In both these cases, what these politicians offered to the ruling parties is a vote base that they could energise, whether by patronage or polarisation. Neither offered an investment in the principles of the Constitution, in fundamental rights, in the life of the nation, in issues of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, in deepening democracy, and the importance of federalism and the identity of regions. Why would they? They were in the business of being doorkeepers, and if doors were easily accessible to all, their own value would plummet. This corrosive failure is most clearly seen in Kashmir, where Muslims have largely adopted a “nationalistic” line that is deeply at odds with Constitutional values. The cost of this has been that a political issue has been handled as a communal issue. Today, as many of the same features of misgovernance in Kashmir find their way into the national agenda, Kashmiris snarkily comment to Muslims – who ignored these very same issues of the degradation of democracy, the gutting of institutions, of impunity and murder – that they have got what they deserved. And frankly, it is true. Too busy fighting little turf wars to protect their “privilege” to serve the rulers, or in highlighting their difference from mainstream debates, Muslims have found themselves completely on the sidelines of democratic debate. In many ways, the failure of the elite is far greater than that of the mullahs. Most of the community members who attend madarsas, or are trained as ulema, come from under-privileged families who have few options, and have not had the depth and breadth of education or experience to engage well with politics. The elite do not have this excuse. If there is hope for Muslim leadership, it lies in the fact that the prosperity of the nation as a whole has allowed a wider educated middle class to emerge. While the Sachar Commission report highlighted the woeful socio-economic condition of Muslims, what should not be forgotten is that Indians as a whole are far better educated and living in better conditions than at the time of Independence. As part of that progress, Muslims have benefited too, if not as much as others. This rising base of capable young men and women are the ones in the frontlines of the battle for Constitutional values, it is on their shoulders that the future of Muslim politics in India rests, and the future of India as a whole, because there is no good future with such a large part of the body politic going unrepresented.","date":"2018-02-11","tag":"Hindutva,BJP,Communal politics,Muslims in India","title":"The failure, and hope, of Muslim politics in India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/muslims-in-india-communal-politics-bjp-hindutva-kasganj-asaduddin-owaisi/story/1/22300.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15278},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"Our history and mythology are full of women punished for laughing. Laughing in an open court at the king’s follies, when everyone would rather please the emperor, is blasphemy, a written and/or unwritten code. Laughing at untruths peddled as fierce rhetoric, combatting willful instrumentalisation of historical ignorance to farcical and fearful ends is a heroine’s job. Standing out is a heroine’s way of being, laughing at the powerful whom no one dare displease is what she does for a living. , Congress MP, 63, laughed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday (February 7), when he was delivering a speech in Rajya Sabha. He was going on and on about how Gandhi wanted a “Congress-mukt Bharat”, just like hours back in Lok Sabha he had claimed without Sardar Patel, Kashmir wouldn’t have been divided. These historical distortions, fraudulent claims, these lies, that PM Modi utters in Parliament, the highest legislating body in the country, in the garb of “roaring”, or “declaring war on the Nehru-Gandhis”, as much of the media would have us believe, are enough to drive anyone with a secondary school sense of history into peals of hysterical laughter. On Twitter, historian Srinath Raghavan tweeted out the obvious “facts” of 1947 and the case of Kashmir, and many shared his words with a hearty laugh at the PM. Chowdhury laughed inside Parliament, in Rajya Sabha. While she was laughing, she was breaching “etiquette”, written down rules of good conduct, usually reserved to maintain order in the House, but also to preserve equality among the representatives. Yet, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu interrupted PM Modi to chastise Chowdhury, saying he needed to report such “loose talk and unruly behaviour”. Naidu didn’t interrupt Modi once, or contradict his claims of counterfeit, his downright disgusting humiliation of the most luminous star in India’s historical firmament, Jawaharlal Nehru. Naidu interrupted to reprimand Chowdhury instead, give her sermons of discipline, egging on PM Modi in his act of hysterical fraudulence.  It was then PM Modi, in a matter of pointed rebuke, said the chairman mustn’t say anything to Chowdhury, because it was after a long time since Ramanad Sagar's   serial was aired, did they get to hear such a laughter. MoS home Kiren Rijiju tweeted out the clip, describing Chowdhury’s laugh as “vexatious”. Some headlines called it  , others reported how BJP national president and Rajya Sabha MP Amit Shah burst out laughing after Modi’s rebuke, along with the men and a few women in the upper House, laughing along, because they dare not laugh at. \r\n \r\n There are many Ramayanas, but in the version most pleasing to the north Indian patriarchy that has a fetish for the warrior king Rama, the laughing women are not the female protagonists. Surpanakha, Ravana’s sister, supposedly laughed at Lakshmana, and had her nose cut off. Manthara, the hunchback aide to Kaikeyi, the middle queen, the muddle queen, of Dasharatha, perhaps laughed while whispering the lure of power and the throne into the queen’s ears. Laughing in Ramayana is akin to evil; laughing is dangerous because it liberates women from the rib cage of patriarchy. In turn, patriarchy, its scribes, retellers, turn them into deformed minds and bodies, monstrosities stinking of deeply racial stereotypes, making them responsible for what’s ultimately a challenge to the inevitability of primogeniture - eldest male succession - and male control of everything around. In feminist rereadings of Ramayana,  , as she sings the blues, controls her womb, makes decisions. In male fantasy version of Ramayana, Sita immolates herself for the sake of her husband, to prove her chastity. However, in the superior epic that’s Mahabharata, the female protagonist Draupadi laughs a lot, menstruates, has sex with five men at least. Draupadi laughs at Duryodhana when he falls into a pool thinking it’s a crystal floor in a palace at Indraprastha. Duryodhana takes his revenge by having his younger brother try disrobe Draupadi in the court of king Dhritarashtra, before a manel of royal loyalists, some tied to the throne, some to sycophancy, turning away their gaze from the injustice. The Kuru clan gets decimated in a “just war”, desired by the Kurus themselves. Laughing women appear in Greco-Roman myths. Helen (before she was of Troy) had laughed at the uncouth Menelaus, whom she was wedded to. She eloped with Paris, and Homer made her the peg on which to hang the male imperial and sexual insecurities. In  , French feminist Helene Cixous wrote how the laughing woman is always the outlier, the biggest challenger to patriarchy’s self-replicating tropes. So, she must be turned into a demon, a gorgon. The laughing woman is seen as a castrator, an antithesis to the power of the male pen and the penis. Laughing women are punished by gods everywhere, turned into stone, raped, turned into animals, cast away, chained, imprisoned, rebuked, called a witch, bitch. Laughing women’s agency makes the gods shiver, so they take to collective punishment. Even Milan Kundera, the great Czech writer of  - weaponised the male laughter at the powerful as worthy of his writerly attention, critical engagement. Female laughter deflated even men like Kundera; so characters like Zedna laugh but also complain, nag. Female solitude was erotic - but female laughter too challenging, too uncomfortable, in fact “emasculating”. Men laughing at men, or men becoming victims of the political consequences of their unscheduled laughter, men refusing to join in the chorus of orchestrated laughter, the theatre of cheerfulness at a totalitarian time - they happen to people Kundera’s universe of laughing men in a laughable world. But women are either props of that laughable world, or outliers incinerating the self-worth of these leading men, prompting the writer to scavenge the myths in search of a bogus salvation. Renuka Chowdhury laughed at Narendra Modi, in Parliament. It’s the laughter of powerless at the powerful, the laughter that momentarily inverts the order, as it were. Chowdhury’s laughter resembled that of Baubo, the Greek goddess of mirth and laughter, whose liberation is bundled with her wisdom, for she knows she must laugh at the powerful, and heal the powerless. And that solitary laughter at power is incredibly more powerful than a court laughing at its single female challenger, the harbinger of the imminent fall.      ","date":"2018-02-08","tag":"Patriarchy,Parliament,Modi,Renuka Chowdhury","title":"Why Renuka Chowdhury’s laughter is more powerful than that of Modi coterie","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/renuka-chowdhury-laughter-modi-parliament-patriarchy-bjp-ramayana-mahabharata-draupadi/story/1/22262.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15279},{"author":"Geeta Mohan","content":"The  administration, in what is being termed as \"bold\" and a \"historic\" visit, has decided to de-hyphenate   and engage with both nations separately. While many believed that the Indian prime minister and his government will shift course, after the BJP came to power in 2014, from the traditional line that India always took on Palestine, the decision to vote in favour of Palestine at the UN and now the visit has infused hope and confidence in Ramallah. Not only has a strong foreign policy decision been made, but also the highest level of the Indian leadership has “belled the cat”, taking on the daunting task of visiting Ramallah. \r\n \r\n For many years, India’s visit to Israel and Palestine at the highest level were given a miss keeping in mind the \"sensitivities\" involved. And then in 2017, breaking away from past trappings, Prime Minister Modi took the bold decision to visit Israel - visit Israel alone without touching Palestine, which made many question India’s stand. Have we given up on Palestine? Is this a shift in India’s foreign policy? These were the common refrain. Clearly not. Certain sections in India hailed the Israel visit as one where India has charted out a new course for itself without pandering to the “appeasement” brigade and reaching out to Muslims... Until reality set in. India understood the importance of balancing ties and accounting for the important role Arab nations play in India’s economic growth story which led to the announcement of his “stand-alone” visit to Palestine. But many still ask, will Modi stay the course on India’s support to the Palestinian cause? India’s defence and security ties with Israel is growing exponentially. And the strong Jewish lobby certainly can help India’s case against Pakistan in the United States. But then again, Israel also has great relations with China. A nation that sides with Pakistan even if all odds are against the latter. Either Israel can be an influencer or despite strong Sino-Israel ties, China can continue to support Pakistan. The Arab world, on the other hand, is a stabilising factor providing jobs and is a major source of energy for India. But here again, terrorism and security matters sometimes adversely impact India’s interests. If India is trying to be transactional in its dealings with the nations of this region, then the decision to stay the course works in India’s favour. There is a strong opinion growing in Palestine that with the disruptive role that the US has played on the issue of Jerusalem and with the closeness that Modi shares with Benjamin Netanyahu, India could be an influencer rather than a disruptor. But both Israel and Palestine also realise that the Modi era is finite. Hence, what is important is to ensure a continuum in the foreign policy rather than a hasty shift that could spoil India’s equilibrium in the region. Interestingly, both Israel and Palestine are calling the outreach a “love affair”, neither unable to fathom why is Modi giving the time of day to the other.","date":"2018-02-09","tag":"Gulf,Narendra Modi,Israel,India-Palestine ties","title":"National interest over ideology, but will India stay the course on Palestine?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-palestine-visit-gulf-israel-mahmoud-abbas-ramallah-benjamin-netanyahu/story/1/22269.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15280},{"author":"Nikhil Wagle","content":"There is a new spring in Sharad Pawar’s step ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief has already managed to cobble up an informal alliance, and we saw a glimpse of that at the January 26 \" \" march in Mumbai. Even though the rally was organised by MP Raju Shetty and MLC Jitendra Awhad, Pawar was the one pulling the strings. He personally made calls to the main Opposition leaders, ensuring the presence of the likes of Sharad Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Omar Abdullah, D Raja and so on. More importantly, the senior state Congress leaders too were present at the rally. If there is any chance of an Opposition unity, Pawar knows it isn’t possible without the backing of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. He was in touch with them from the beginning. On top of that, he even tweeted saying that the next moves would be decided after consulting Rahul Gandhi. Later, the Opposition leaders held two more meetings, one at Sonia Gandhi’s residence, and the other at Pawar’s. \r\n \r\n Known for his astuteness, Pawar’s strategy should be seen in the context of the dramatically changing political climate in India. According to an IndiaSpend analysis published recently, the BJP could be down to   from its unprecedented 282 seats. In the last four years, 15 states have witnessed Assembly elections. Those 15 states had fetched the BJP 191 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. But considering the downward popularity of the BJP in those states, along with trends in Gujarat Assembly elections and Rajasthan by-polls, the ruling party looks set to lose considerable vote share in 2019. In such a scenario, the non-BJP and non-Congress parties can make a considerable difference. If the BJP is restricted at around 225, and the Congress at 125, the remaining 193 seats could be crucial, and that is where Pawar comes into play. He enjoys excellent rapport with parties across the board, irrespective of their ideologies. And with BJP’s current allies such as the Shiv Sena, the TDP and the Akali Dal upset with Modi, Pawar could easily exploit the situation. Moreover, more than 100 BJP’s MPs are Congress turncoats. Smelling an opportunity, Pawar seems to have rekindled his dream of becoming the prime minister. He has been trying his luck since Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, however, only in vain. In 1991, Pawar took on PV Narasimha Rao in the leadership race. I was witness to these happenings in New Delhi. Pawar’s Man Friday, Suresh Kalmadi, tried his best even as  his industrialist friends extended their full support. But Narasimha Rao was equally shrewd and knew the Congress party better than Pawar. He defeated Pawar, made him defence minister and sent him back to Maharashtra after the 1993 blasts. Since then Pawar’s close associates have tried their best to revive his dream during each Parliament election except the 2014 battle. The Modi wave had seemingly demolished Pawar’s dream even before the race began. Pawar admitted this publicly several times. But now in a changed political scenario, the NCP veteran has become active once again. Of course, if you ask him that, he would deny it immediately. However, there are several impediments in the way of his PM dream. The biggest of them is his own credibility crisis, not just in Maharashtra, but across the country. Even Opposition leaders around him concede the fact that he cannot be trusted. Not too long ago, his party unconditionally supported the   government in Maharashtra from outside in 2014 and kept the minority BJP government afloat after the Assembly polls threw up a hung verdict. Also, his friendship with Modi is looked at with suspicion. And even though his relationship with Rahul Gandhi has improved in the recent past, to what extent will the Congress president repose his trust in Pawar is anybody’s guess. Further, how would the big Opposition leaders with even bigger egos work with each other? The TMC is currently the third-largest party in Lok Sabha. Mamata Banerjee’s hold over West Bengal is comfortable. Even though she sent her representative to Mumbai for the rally, she later said it is just a formality. Why would Banerjee accept Pawar’s leadership, who doesn’t even have 15 MPs? Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav will also ask the same question. Within a week of the Pawar-led march, Akhilesh Yadav conducted his own rally in Mumbai. Moreover, Akhilesh and Mayawati haven’t joined hands either. Even in Mumbai, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh chief and Dalit stalwart Prakash Ambedkar is not ready to repose his trust in Pawar. On top of that, leaders from the southern states remain unpredictable as ever. The ego battles between regional parties are historic and the country has seen it closely in 1977, 1989 and 1996. There is another possibility that cannot be neglected. If the BJP’s seats go down to a level where Modi cannot hold the allies together,   within the NDA could emerge as a preferred candidate to lead the country. The late PA Sangma’s son and NPP chief Conrad Sangma, has recently said that in as many words. (For the uninitiated, the National People's Party was formed by the veteran PA Sangma after he left the NCP, which he, along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar, founded in 1999 following their expulsion from the Congress for opposing Sonia Gandhi's leadership over her foreign origin. Pawar and Sangma later fell out after the NCP refused to back Sangma's candidature for President of India in 2012. An ally of the NDA, the NPP's influence is mostly concentrated in Meghalaya, which is going to Assembly polls on February 27.) Notwithstanding the ever-changing equations, Pawar in all likelihood will continue to play an important role.

Sheikh is the man behind the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul case in which a huge cache of arms and explosives to target political leaders were procured. Leads from Sheikh’s sustained interrogation have already helped the National Investigation Agency (NIA) make two vital arrests from Bihar’s Gopalganj district. The latest arrests were on Thursday when the premier investigating agency picked a suspected operative of terrorist outfit LeT from Gopalganj district for his alleged involvement in creating a sleeper cell of the banned organisation in Bihar. An NIA team from Delhi picked up one Mahfooz Alam from his house at Khajurbanni locality of Gopalganj, around 145km northwest of capital city Patna. Alam has been taken to Delhi for interrogation. Incidentally, this was NIA’s second arrest the same district in last two months after the agency picked one Bedar Bakht alias Dhannu Raja on December 1.  Both Alam and Bakht have been found to have assisted Sheikh, and provided logistic, financial support and shelter to him. The two also collected funds for Sheikh through international money transfer services. All these arrests have revealed an uncanny terror link to Gopalganj district, as Sheikh too had spent two years in this district from early 2015 to March 2017. These arrests have raised a flag about Bihar, as the intelligence agencies are said to be assessing what drew the terrorists to Gopalganj district. While he was in Gopalganj, Sheikh ran a private coaching institute in the Bihar town, where he indoctrinated youths and built sleeper cells of the banned terror outfit. Prior to making Bihar his base, Sheikh was arrested in West Bengal in 2007 while infiltrating into India from Bangladesh with two Pakistanis and one Kashmiri. He escaped from judicial custody in 2014 while being taken to Mumbai to the MCOCA court there. Investigations have revealed that while government agencies frantically searched for him after his escape, Sheikh was relatively safe, teaching spoken English at his Gopalganj-based coaching institute called Smart Learner. Sheikh, considered close to 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Abu Jindal, had obtained Aadhaar card, passport and PAN (Permanent Account Number) under a pseudonym of Suhail Khan alias Mohammad Ali. Incidentally, Nayeem’s story bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Md Tauseef Khan, the 30- something mastermind of the July 2008 Ahmedabad blast, who was arrested from Bihar’s Gaya district in September last year. Tauseef too had taken shelter in Bihar’s Gaya district and was working as a school-teacher after triggering explosions in Ahmedabad, which killed 56 people and injured over 200. Nayeem is also believed to have obtained fake certificates of secondary school to get his passport issued from the Patna regional passport office. The NIA is also questioning a number of district-level officials to find out how Abdul Nayeem Sheikh, a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, succeeded in getting a domicile certificate, driving license, matriculation certificate and passport issued in the assumed name of Suhail Khan. Incidentally, Bihar has its old connections with terror outfits. Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and another operative, Abdul Karim Tunda, were arrested from the Raxaul border in East Champaran district.

Let’s do the electoral math by placing the country into four clusters: 1) north and west; 2) south; 3) east; and 4) Northeast and union territories.  This comprises 12 states (Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh). Together they offer 259 seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 205 seats out of its overall tally of 282 seats from this 12-state, 259-seat cluster. This is therefore the make-or-break cluster for the BJP. In 2019 though, it can realistically expect to win only around 150 seats from these 12 key north-western states. That’s a fall of 55 seats over 2014 due to strong anti-incumbency, the Congress’ resurgence and the   across the region. Can it make up this large decline in the other zones?  The five are unlikely to provide a cushion. The BJP won 21 out of 129 available seats in the south in 2014. Karnataka provided 17 of these. Again realistically, the BJP is unlikely to increase its tally significantly in 2019. Kerala may offer the odd extra seat. Karnataka could even slip a little, leaving the BJP with around 20 seats in the south. Together in the first two clusters, the BJP’s tally could therefore total around 170.  The four key eastern states of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand could prove crucial for the BJP. In 2014, the BJP won 37 seats in these four states from 117 seats on offer. In 2019, it will rely heavily on seat-sharing with ally JD(U) to sweep Bihar. Odisha promises a rich harvest too with dissent at the top of Naveen Patnaik’s BJD giving the BJP an opening. West Bengal remains a distant prospect though the BJP is likely to make inroads as the Left continues to lose traction. Meanwhile, with Jharkhand, where the BJP won 12 out of 14 seats in 2014, still a safe bet, the BJP could increase its tally in the 117-seat east cluster from 37 seats in 2014 to around 45 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP’s overall tally in the first three clusters rises to around 215 seats.  The   has been a special focus for the BJP. In 2014, it won just eight out of 25 seats in the seven northeastern states and Sikkim - seven of them from Assam. The BJP-backed North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) has changed the situation dramatically. The party can expect to raise its tally to around 14 seats in 2019. The seven union territories (UTs), including Delhi NCT, contributed 11 out of 13 available seats to the BJP in 2014. That total is unlikely to change much, though Delhi could swing partially towards the Congress, giving the BJP around 25 out of 38 seats on offer in the fourth cluster. Thus, the four clusters, in a best-case scenario, are likely to provide the BJP with 240 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election (150+20+45+25). Caveat: a Mayawati-Mulayam-Congress mahagathbandhan, however unlikely, could significantly reduce the BJP’s tally in Uttar Pradesh, cutting its Lok Sabha numbers to the low 220s. Unpredictable events such as a positive verdict by the Supreme Court in the Ram Mandir case and escalation of a conflict with Pakistan could in turn change the electoral math in favour of the BJP. Clearly, the BJP with 220-240 seats will not be able to form a government without the support of NDA allies. The Shiv Sena, TDP, LJP, SAD and others have varying degrees of problems with the BJP. To form a stable NDA coalition, the BJP would need at least 50 seats from its allies, taking the alliance’s tally to around 270-290. With the JD(U), but without the Shiv Sena, even that may prove difficult. The Rajinikanth factor in Tamil Nadu though could play a decisive role if he allies with the NDA, making Shiv Sena support redundant. Now turn to the Congress. To win power, Rahul Gandhi will have to rely heavily on old and new UPA allies. Across our four clusters, the Congress will be lucky to win 85-90 seats overall. To be a credible challenger to form a UPA 3 government, the Congress will need the following eleven key allies: TMC, the Left, DMK, SP, RJD, BSP, JD(S), AIMIM, NC, NCP and TRS. Defections from the NDA’s disgruntled allies would be welcome. Again, taking a best-case scenario, despite the unlikely prospect of the BSP and SP as well as the Left and TMC cohabiting in UPA 3, the 11 key allies together with smaller Congress-leaning parties are unlikely to garner more than 120 seats. Even if the Congress doubles its own tally to 90 seats, a putative UPA 3 would have only 210 Lok Sabha seats in all (90+120) - far short of a working majority. The way forward for the Congress therefore is to win at least 150 seats on its own as it did in 2004. Then only will it be able to cobble together a workable UPA 3 coalition in 2019 with over 270 seats (150 Congress plus 120 allies). In 2004, the Left with 60 seats supported the 145-seat Congress from outside. Other UPA 1 allies made up the numbers. In 2019, though relatively weakened, the BJP will still win far more than the 138 seats it won in 2004. At our estimate of 220-240 seats, the BJP can effectively thwart a potential UPA 3 - unless the Congress nearly quadruples its 2014 tally of 44 to well over 150. There just aren’t enough UPA allies to make up the slack as there were in 2004 with the Left’s 60 seats plumetting in 2014 to just nine. In 2019, the largest UPA ally will be the TMC with 30-odd seats. For the BJP, the message is clear. Five consecutive mediocre Budgets have alienated the middle class. They count for little electorally, but have a disproportionate influence on the political narrative. The BJP’s policies over the past 45 months have been a mixed bag: in sum, it has failed to deliver maximum governance and minimum government. It has less than a year to reverse the slide. The Lok Sabha election may well be advanced to December 2018 along with the key state polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in order to mask strong anti-incumbency. The BJP though does have one trump card: a still-anaemic Congress. But it can’t rely on that forever. To win re-election, the BJP will have to perform. Or perish.","date":"2018-02-07","tag":"NDA,Congress,BJP,Lok Sabha elections 2019","title":"Why Modi faces rocky road to 272 in 2019 Lok Sabha elections","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-2019-lok-sabha-elections-bjp-nda-allies-disgruntled-272-mark/story/1/22234.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15283},{"author":"Harsh V Pant","content":"Crisis in the Maldives escalated this week after President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of Emergency and asked the military troops to arrest two top judges and detain former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition. Last week the nation’s Supreme Court had ordered the release of nine imprisoned Opposition politicians on the ground that their trials were politically motivated and flawed. The government refused to implement the ruling which led to widespread demonstrations in Male and clashes between the police and protesters. Calling President Yameen’s announcement “unconstitutional and illegal”, exiled former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed, the country’s first democratically-elected leader, has urged India to “act swiftly” to resolve the crisis. In some ways, Yameen’s actions are understandable as his options after the Supreme Court ruling were limited. The court verdict not only paves the way for Nasheed to return from his exile in Colombo and run for the presidency this year but also makes Yameen’s impeachment potentially plausible. Yameen must be calculating that with help of friends of like China, he would be able to ride over the crisis that would emerge with his declaration of Emergency. The alacrity with which the Maldives embraced China seems to have caught India off guard. But New Delhi’s engagement with Male has been hesitant of late and China has made the most of it. During Yameen’s China visit last year, the two nations signed 12 pacts, including a free trade agreement. Yameen also fully endorsed China’s ambitious Maritime Silk Road initiative. President Xi Jinping declared that “China deems the Maldives as an important partner” in this initiative and Yameen repaid the favour by claiming that the Maldives viewed China “among (its) closest friends” and that “the Belt and Road Initiative has greatly helped the development of many small and medium countries”. At a time when China’s belt and road initiative is beginning to attract scrutiny around the world, with even erstwhile supporters calling for a reassessment, such an endorsement is much sought after by Beijing. The Maldives became the second country in South Asia, after Pakistan, to enter into a free trade agreement with China. The Yameen government pushed the FTA through the nation’s Parliament, the Majlis, stealthily, with the Opposition not attending the parliamentary session. The principal Opposition party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that it was “deeply concerned over sudden and rushed Free Trade Agreement with China, without any disclosure of details to the public or to the MPs”. The concerns of the Opposition centre around a possible increase in the trade deficit, already tilted in favour of China, and the strategic direction of the country. The MDP has argued that it is worried “that further entrenchment of the country into a Chinese debt trap will result in additional stress on strategic national assets and increasing instability in the Indian Ocean region”. But that is where Yameen wants to take his country, it seems. On the one hand, he has been flirting with Islamist extremism and on the other, he wants to use closer ties with China to shield his government from global criticism. After the first-ever visit by a Chinese President to the Maldives in 2014, it officially became a part of the \"21st-century Maritime Silk Road.\" China quickly expanded its economic profile in the Maldives by building mega infrastructure projects, including the development of Hulhule island and a bridge connecting it to Male as well as the country’s main international airport. A constitutional amendment allowing foreign ownership of freehold land was passed in 2015, which can potentially enhance Chinese military presence in the island nation. Already, Chinese naval ships have become regular visitors to Male. During his 2016 visit to Delhi, Yameen had said his country pursues an “India first” foreign policy, describing it as the Maldives’s most important friend. But that was just after India had shielded the Yameen government from punitive action by the Commonwealth’s human rights and democracy oversight body. New Delhi’s recent policy of engaging with the Maldivian Opposition, especially the former President, Mohammad Nasheed, may be causing heartburn in Male and so the outreach to China has intensified. The Maldives remains the only country in South Asia which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to visit. There were many in India who had been critical of the Modi government’s light touch approach vis-à-vis Yameen over the last few years as he systematically worked at destroying the foundations of democracy in his country. But New Delhi had other interests to preserve in the archipelago nation. Now the moment of reckoning has come for both New Delhi and Yameen. India’s suggestion that the Supreme Court’s ruling should be promptly implemented was clearly given a short shrift by Yameen. New Delhi will have to intervene cautiously. A coordinated response with other like-minded regional and extra-regional players will be the first step. But like in the past, New Delhi should not be shy of using coercive diplomacy if only to underscore that ignoring India’s warnings comes at a price. The logic of geography dictates that India’s role will be critical in determining the trajectory of political developments in the Maldives.

So do nations. Nothing manifested that better than the congregation of the super rich, their global affluence evident as their private jets swooped into the Swiss Alps at Davos, an annual bash of eclectic celebrity capitalists where India was supposedly doing a showstopper-walk, and the tragic suicide of  , an 84-year-old beleaguered farmer from Maharashtra who committed suicide amid the hustle-bustle of Mumbai's non-stop irrepressible energy. There could not have been a more apposite paradox to explain India's inherent contradictions. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made another of his highfalutin speeches to hard-sell India (even as India Inc palpably serenaded him on bent knees, despite the snow), but appeared blissfully unaware of some hard economic data that had surfaced concomitantly from the organisers, the World Economic Forum itself. India's ranking in the Inclusive Development Index had slumped to 62; an appalling commentary on the skewed policies of the last four years of Mr Modi's government which has increased social disparities. Not surprisingly, it seemed to synchronise with the astonishing fact that  . US President Donald Trump followed Modi to justify his America First pitch to the august gathering of essentially free-market fundamentalists. Like India, America has seen an escalating income inequality, ironically electing a tax-evading, anti-free trade, ultra-nationalist avatar in a billionaire businessman with a dubious track-record as its man in the White House. Politics is indeed weird. Even as India's stock markets breached stratospheric levels crossing 35,000 levels prompting pink papers to go into uncontrollable euphoria, Dharma Patil lay dead at JJ hospital. The state government of Maharashtra had refused to respond to his several entreaties for help after it acquired his land for a pathetic pittance. It was unconscionable. The opposition blamed the government of Devendra Fadnavis for culpable homicide; in effect, it was callous nonchalance to a desperate cry for help. It was a stark reminder of one Gajendra Singh from Rajasthan who hung himself from a tree while an election rally proceeded with much fanfare in New Delhi. It was an ugly manifestation of a society that had forgotten its once revered creator of the rice bowl. Evidently, we have chosen to turn a blind eye to the hapless farmer, once deserving of a national call; Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. Arun Jaitley, India's Finance Minister, who famously declared that India will double farmers' income in five years, has been extraordinarily silent on his progress report. Perhaps that is understandable given that after four years of the Modi government , the average agricultural growth is just 1.9 per cent. To achieve the ambitious growth levels projected with profuse showmanship by the government, a minimum of 12 per cent is needed. The target is ridiculously off the curve, but ask any policy wonk and he will tell you that it is always a preposterous kite-flying exercise. That begs the question, have we become so politically immoral that we make even suffering farmers dream of bountiful profits when in fact it is nothing more than a mirage, a chimera? Or are Indian politicians, once elected, decoupled from ground realities? In his farewell budget on February 1, 2018, Mr Jaitley made another grandiloquent claim; that his government had successfully provided for minimum support price of 50 per cent over cost-of-crop production as it had promised in its 2014 manifesto. It seemed like a stunning apocryphal story, because the definition of the cost of production had been deliberately left ambiguous. The convenient formula was adopted, but based on that measure, the farmers were getting 50 per cent over MSP since the UPA days. In that case, what was Modi promising during the 2014 election campaign? At the time of writing, very few in the mainstream media have even questioned this brazen inconsistency. Mr Modi also magnanimously laid out the red carpet for foreign investors citing India's charming hospitality and tranquil environs. But back home it was anything but. The release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's   was meshed in  , and agitating Karni Sena supporters had become official non-state actors, as several BJP state governments happily catapulted to their intimidating threat to not release the controversial film. Chopping off heads of those who were related to the film was publicly broadcasted by these insidious hate groups, but the prime minister did not think a strong condemnation was necessary. Despite a scathing indictment from the Supreme Court, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh refused to screen the film, citing law and order risks. It was tantamount to acquiescing that they were incapable of ensuring governance, despite having the full police force under their authority. The world could see the farcical melodrama turning violent, but India's elected leaders did not budge. What was once classified as right wing fringe was now a legitimate mainstream disruptor, courtesy official umbrage. Their poisonous footprint is on the rise, as punitive action has not been taken. At last count the film was headed for blockbuster box-office collections, and the Rajput community had not found anything offensive enough about it. So what was the purpose behind the belligerent posturing? And why did Indian politicians play ball? But on the day of the hugely hyped budget, something remarkable happened. Even as Mr Jaitley gave his budget speech, from nearby Rajasthan, people spoke in collective unison, condemning both the wilful neglect of the farming community and the senseless mayhem over a commercial film. The BJP got a   in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat. The voters had seen through their forked tongue that sells stardust dreams even as it deliberately ignores solving the real issues. February 1 was a reminder that Indian democracy was still alive.

At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ","date":"2018-02-04","tag":"Tamil Nadu,Hindi,MK Stalin,Tamil","title":"Hindi is becoming a rallying point in Tamil Nadu politics again","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tamil-mk-stalin-hindi-tamil-nadu-karunanidhi-madras-high-court-anti-hindi-agitation/story/1/22178.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15286},{"author":"M Reyaz","content":"One of the top trends on Twitter on Saturday was #AnkitSaxena, a 23-year old young photographer from Delhi   by the family members of the 20-year old girl he was allegedly in a relationship with for three years. No, Ankit's case was not trending merely to demand justice for the victim's family or as a debate over the law and order situation in the national capital. Not even because some custodians of culture and tradition are supporting the murderers or because Twitterati are outraged over the \"honour killing\". Ankit's case has instead given the right wing and their whole politics grounds to demonise and target the community they love to hate. Ankit's girlfriend Shehzadi was a Muslim. His killers, the girl's father, mother, uncle and a minor brother also come from the same faith. She had allegedly locked her family members in the house and fled after an argument. The enraged father, accompanied by other family members, came out with a knife in his hand and found Ankit, who lived nearby in west Delhi, on a scooter. A scuffle started. According to the police, as the family members held Ankit tightly, the father of the girl slit his throat. All accused have already been arrested, and a case has been filed at the local police station in west Delhi. One hopes that the law will take its course and the aggrieved family will get justice. What is troubling is that instead of asking for justice certain media and the right wing forces are using the case to bash the entire Muslim community and they are being forced to condemn the gruesome incident. So far only in terror cases guilt by association was raised to target one community, but even though not one person has spoken in support of the murderers, the whole community is being demonised and bashed. Imagine for a moment that the boy was Muslim and girl a Hindu, the right wing would have justified the incident in the name of a purported case of \"love jihad\". On the contrary, I have not come across any Muslim on social media justifying the murder; rather they have all expressed shock, some have condemned it and demanded swift action from the police. It is rather ironical that the same people who are targeting the Muslim community would be asking people to celebrate on February 14, the Valentine's Day, as \"Matri Pitri Poojan Diwas\", and have called Hadiya a victim of love jihad. Religion must have played an important role in the decision of Shehzadi's family to not accept their daughter's choice, but it is more of a patriarchal problem than anything else. I have written earlier, how families find any pretext under the sky to  . Our society at large has still not come to terms with the fact that adult men and women can themselves make a better decision in choosing their life partner, and would rather get them married to people of their choice. The so-called   is one of most dishonourable things for any society that claims to be civilised, irrespective of religion or creed or caste. Professor Dibyesh Anand of Westminster University rightly pointed out after the incident, \"The lethal concept is not a religion but proprietorial-patriarchal-family-honour that afflicts many Hindus, Muslims, and others alike.\" Killing a daughter or her partner for defying them is not unique to any one community but is a larger malaise in our part of the world that sadly often has sanctions from religious leaders as well as community formations such as khap panchayats. Only in January, there was a report of a (Hindu)   as he had dared to marry the girl from another caste. And ironically on the same day Ankit was murdered, I saw a  , of a woman being savagely flogged for an alleged extramarital affair.

The Opposition has claimed that Patil consumed the poison outside chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s office at the sixth floor of Mantralaya as the government failed to deliver justice to him. Patil had received compensation of Rs 4 lakh for his five-acre farm whereas his neighbour Kisan Girase got Rs 1.98 crore for one-acre farmland, though both of them had planted mango trees. The case has exposed the chinks in the state’s administration as well as the unholy practices adopted while granting compensation to land. Girase stands accused of paying a bribe of Rs 1 crore to the officials from land acquisition department to get higher compensation. At the same time, a nexus between officials and land-selling agents also has come to fore. Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar admits that the nexus exists. “The government does not make any discrimination between the beneficiaries. It is the officials who misinterpret and take disadvantage of the government schemes,” he told me. It has become a trend over a couple of years to plant mango trees in farm land to increase its value at the time of land acquisition even though the climate does not suit the trees. Water resources minister Girish Mahajan points that agents purchase land from poor farmers at throwaway prices, “import” mango trees from Konkan and demand higher price at the time of acquisition. The mango trees are literally “replanted” to create an impression that they exist in a particular farm land for many years. As per rules, if a farm land has mango trees its values grows multifold. In some cases, the government has given Rs 1 crore for one acre farm land when the actual price was Rs 10 lakh because of the mango trees. “This is not possible without the direct involvement of government officials,” Mahajan admitted. “They know it better which land would be acquired for which project.” He pointed that the government had carried survey of the proposed super communication highway between Nagpur and Mumbai, known as Samruddhi Corridor, using Google maps to count the number of trees on the patch before the project was announced. “If we had not done that the agents would have replanted mango trees everywhere on the corridor making the project economically unviable,” Mahajan said. The government has reserved Rs 10,000 crore only for compensation to land acquisition. The nexus exists for a long time. Patil’s case has given the government an opportunity to break it once and all.  (Courtesy of  )","date":"2018-02-02","tag":"BJP,Dharma Patil,Devendra Fadnavis,Mango Scam","title":"It's rotten.

A grand scheme intended to tackle an incredibly serious policy issue with almost no details of know-how in the public domain. Yet, it was celebrated as if the outcome it sought had already been achieved. Yesterday (February 1) seemed no different. Once again we forgot what   was good at: fooling us with lofty goals with a tinge of morality added to it. “Modicare”, as it’s now being touted, seeks to provide health insurance to about 100 million “vulnerable” families across India. About 40 per cent of the country’s population (or 500 million beneficiaries) will be \"protected\" under the scheme. Yet somehow its being touted as a system of universal healthcare. A universal scheme should generally cover all citizens, but that’s a matter of separate debate. Unsurprisingly, it overshadowed pretty much everything else in the discussions around the Budget (including a higher fiscal deficit, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax and changes to custom duties for about 50 items). It was supposedly the \"aha moment\" of the  for many TV news anchors and commentators. The general consensus was that the poor and the destitute end up spending a large portion of their income on secondary and tertiary healthcare and that the government is right in providing a helping hand. Imagine if they don’t need to save for a rainy day? Imagine if they are free to use that money to consume goods and services? Imagine what would it do to accelerate growth, and thereby generate greater revenue? Undoubtedly, all of these instances are possible, but it requires a rock-solid combination of detailed plans, smooth execution, a big pot of cash and a ton of luck. Unfortunately, the way our governments are designed, its hard if not impossible to hit such a sweet spot. In this case as well, no basic plan has been charted out yet. The current plan is to draft a plan in the next six months. In terms of execution, it’s best not to glorify government’s notoriously poor record in implementation of schemes. As for cash, the government could easily end up spending thousands of crores of rupees (maybe a lot more depending on premiums). Where will the money come for it is anyone’s guess. But what seems eerily similar to demonetisation is that no cost-benefit analysis of the scheme seems to have been done. And just like demonetisation, this will most certainly become BJP’s major talking point during elections. Leaving aside these minor technicalities, one has to seriously ask if 500 million individuals in India need mandatory insurance from the government? Sure, no one is arguing against not providing subsidy to those below poverty line (and maybe others). But what about those who can? Wouldn’t they be better off left alone in deciding their choice of insurance and allow the government to use the valuable tax revenue for an alternative purpose? Choice matters as that will allow greater competition amongst private/public insurance companies and not just benefit those who are contracted with the government. India has only so many resources at hand and it would have been ideal to allow states to chart their own course (health is a state subject) rather than initiate a massive scheme from the top. Secondly, most debates moved around the ifs and buts on the health coverage. Not many offered a view from an ideological and principled standpoint. It’s rather easy to get bothered by questions around the government’s ability to fund or implement the project, but its far more important to ask if the government should sponsor such a scheme at all. A similar scheme was proposed in 2016 which offered a coverage of Rs 30,000 per family. That has now been raised to Rs 5 lakh per family. Those in Opposition can always offer another substantial hike until we will reach a point of no return. What are the chances that the government will do away with such a mandate even when most Indians will easily be able to afford it? Third, instead of focusing on drafting policies (reforming land, labour and capital) that would eventually pull people out of poverty and allow them to make enough money to pay for their own and family’s health/education, the government is creating another tax-payer funded entitlement. Yes, both (growth and redistribution) can go on simultaneously, but there is just not enough noise and movement on the former. What looks probable right now is that we will go through another loop of good intentions and bad outcomes. But considering how lucky PM Modi is (and was through the execution of demonetisation), it may just work in his favour, of course electorally.","date":"2018-02-02","tag":"Modi government,Union Budget 2018,Health insurance","title":"Budget 2018: How achievable is Arun Jaitley's promise of health cover for 500 million poor Indians?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/health-insurance-union-budget-arun-jaitley-demonetisation-november-8-2016-modi-election-promise/story/1/22143.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15289},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"Going into the last full Union Budget of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only bet on the farmers, but bet the farm on his rural voters. Articulating his vision for the general election of 2019 quite clearly, he has recognised the existence of rural distress, amplified by a string of farmer protests and suicides last year provoked by falling commodity prices and increasing debt. Hoping to deliver on his promise to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, the Budget has shown every intention of boosting farmers’ incomes by raising the minimum support price for crops to 1.5x the cost of production, liberalising export of agri-commodities, and modernising agricultural markets. This comes in the wake of agri-GDP registering an insipid average annual growth rate of 2 per cent in the first three years of the Modi government - in the last three years of the UPA rule, it was nearly twice this figure. The second clear narrative in Modi Vision 2019 is the creation of jobs. The Budget has seen a push to small businesses, which were badly hit both by demonetisation and the initial implementation of GST. The corporate tax reduction for firms with turnovers below Rs 250 crore as well as Rs 3,794 crore in credit support to MSMEs could help. The continuing push to infrastructure, with expected investments in excess of Rs 50 lakh crore in roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways, is also of a piece with this strong effort - unemployment emerged as the biggest concern among respondents to the India Today Mood of the Nation Poll last week, along with rising prices. Equally clear is the government’s belated recognition of the importance of healthcare and education. As Amartya Sen says, no developed country in the world has progressed without investing in these key areas. On education, the Budget has announced Eklavya schools for tribals as well as 24 new medical colleges and 1,000 new fellowships for doctoral students. In healthcare, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an ambitious National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide up to Rs 5 lakh per year to 100 million families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. Impressive as this sounds, I am not sure the mechanisms or details of funding have been worked out. The expense could be monumental. There is a disconcertingly familiar sense of too many announcements and too little implementation. Take the example of the Smart Cities Mission, announced in 2015, which aimed at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-the-art amenities. So far, 99 cities have been selected with an outlay of Rs 2.04 lakh crore. But projects worth a mere Rs 2,350 crore have been completed. The rest remain \"in progress\". That’s a pathetic strike rate, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the government’s ability to deliver. Given the additional spending, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019 will require disinvestment and the highest ever gross taxes as a percentage of GDP. It is a tough ask, according to Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi, one of the eminent economists in our panel of commentators, but not entirely unachievable. The Budget has nothing for the middle class and large corporates, who in many ways are the bulwark of the economy. The big question is, whether all this will be enough - especially given that the GDP growth rate is expected to fall to 6.75 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to 7.1 the previous year. So far, the economic environment was conducive, but now oil prices have crossed $70 a barrel internationally, and retail inflation has breached the RBI’s target, hitting 5.21 per cent in December. Also, there is nothing to spur the investment rate which has fallen from a peak of nearly 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 26.4 per cent in 2017-18. Unless the government is able to move the needle on this, it is difficult to imagine the accelera­tion in economic growth so necessary to finance its ambitious schemes. My own nagging concern is an old one: I am not sure how much of government expenditure actually reaches the intended beneficiary. In 1985, on a visit to drought-affected Kalahandi in Odisha, the late Rajiv Gandhi said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reached the intended recipient. Has that leaky bucket been fixed? If not, the electoral benefits this government is hoping  for after this Budget may not materialise. Elections are not won on grand announcements or manifestos, but on real development on the ground which people can feel.

And when she’s not working, meaning governing the state or minding politics, she is into creative pursuits — writing books, penning lyrics, composing songs, painting and doodling. Mamata Banerjee has been recently awarded the prestigious DLitt by Calcutta University for her versatile contribution in the field of literature and language and for her gigantic footprints in social work. There was much hue and cry, storm over tea stalls, debates dragging into court as to whether she merited the honorary degree. Ultimately she got the degree and she accepted it teary-eyed and her voice choking, partly for the love and appreciation of a section of people, who considered her eligible, and partly for the insult, humiliation and barbs she had to face in the process. Without going into the sanctity of the awardee, the literary merit of her work, which can be purely subjective (depending on who are judging it, on what basis, under what condition and who are conferring the title), one cannot deny the sheer numbers she has added to the world of printed letters. Half a dozen books a year is child’s play for her and she has been spewing such volume at every Kolkata Book Fair. And for all her detractors crying foul, the books are published by a leading publishing house of Bengal and they are always bestsellers — well at least as per the records of the publishing house. This year too, as the city warms up to another book fair, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is coming out again with not less than half a dozen new publications. She has a volume of already 70 published works and this year it will increase to 76. And think of the range, she has something for everyone: names of babies for would-be or new parents, rhyme-books for toddlers,   for children,   (voice of heart) Urdu shayaris for the youth,   — something about personality development of the young generation, and   (exhorting the young brigade to consider politics as a noble profession) to travelogues ( ) for the trotting community. Her memoirs on struggle —  , the tidbits of bitter-sweet memories of life —  , her youth, desires sacrificed at the altar of politics — Bikel Hnariye Geche (a personal note on how the sweet spring has slipped by), and   — a compilation of quotable quotes on the philosophy and ideology of her life, an allusion to Kathamrita — quotes of Ram Krishna Dev for the spiritually inclined, are her other book. Not to be missed is the historical documentation of important landmark events from the political work — Nandi Ma (the land movement in Nandigram), Singur, Kutshapokksho (Rumour Mongers), a commentary on how the Opposition and the BJP-led Centre were engaged in a slandering campaign to malign her on the eve of 2016 Assembly, Notebandi (Demonetisation) and this year its   (intolerance). Though the majority of the political memoirs are political campaign on her sweat and labour and the string of achievements she has been weaving in, Asohishnuta is an interesting record of the environment of hatred, fear and intolerance unleashed by the saffron party both in the country and her state. The diversity of subject and magnitude of work apart, one should not miss the proficiency of language, the ease with which she nimbly moves through languages, Bengali, English, Urdu and Ol Chiki, some of her books are being translated into Ol Chiki. So if these are not grounds, solid enough to confer her the D.litt, what are? As for the sceptical and high-browed critics, especially those who are deprecating, the Calcutta University as the conferring body chose to seal all probable leaks. The award has been given by virtue of her literary works and her social welfare activities, which have been acknowledged internationally and she has even got the prestigious UN Public Service award for Kanyashree — the scheme for empowering women. The DLitt debate has been dismissed by the court perhaps because it realised that wisdom lies in closing the chapter. After all, there is nothing new in conferring titles and awards to political personalities, great administrators and statesman and it has been the practice all over the world. When men of letters like Dr Mammohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and legends like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi get awarded, the country bursts into euphoria, and rightly so. But the feeling definitely cannot be the same when Akshay Kumar (University of Windsor in 2008) and Shilpa Shetty Kundra flaunt one or godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim claims a doctorate title from some little known UK university. The fact that PM Narendra Modi declined to be awarded a doctorate by BHU in 2016 at the peak of his popularity in recognition of him being a reformer and an outstanding leader in public service and governance is a rare, pragmatic thing. Had he accepted he would have invited similar muck throwing as happened in the case of Mamata.

At least, that was his poll promise of \"na goondaraj, na bhrashtachar (freedom from goons and corruption)\" to the state. However, this year's Republic Day clashes tell a very different story altogether. As residents of Kasganj, belonging to different communities, began preparing for the 69th Republic Day celebrations, a group of ABVP and VHP cadres set out on a bike rally. Passing through every mohalla, they finally reached Baliram Gate. This group, which had no police permission, was also carrying saffron flags - enough to instigate a communal outburst. As they approached the minority-dominated area, their slogans grew louder. Soon, what started out as a verbal spat turned into a violent clash with both sides throwing stones at the other. One man reached for his gun and fired in frenzy which hit 20-year-old Chandan Gupta, killing him two hours later. Another man, Naushad, was also hit in the leg by a bullet and is now recovering at an Aligarh hospital. This was enough to trigger the mob, which went on a rampage across the town. The district police force was in Etah for the Republic Day parade as the town erupted into flames. A mosque was set ablaze and the police, in an FIR, said stones were hurled and bullets fired on them as they tried to quell the commotion. By afternoon, Yogi's promise of \"na goondaraj\" was blown into pieces as shops and buses burning to cinders became the image of Kasganj. The police, unable to control the situation, imposed curfew to restrict mob movement. One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and five companies of Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) along with police forces from adjoining districts were deployed in Kasganj. The district magistrate, inspector-general of police, commissioner of Aligarh and at least half a dozen other IPS officers from adjoining areas were deputed to control the surging violence. But all these measures had no bearing on the rapidly deteriorating condition of Kasganj. Around 9.30pm, Lakhimpur resident Mohammad Akram, unaware of the violence, was on his way home with his pregnant wife in a Tata Safari. As he reached Kasganj, the mob attacked his car. They broke the windows with bamboo sticks and almost gouged out his left eye. \"They saw my beard and attacked me. My wife is expecting and the delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,\" Akram said, his face covered in blood. Akram was attacked in the middle of the town, Agrasen Gate, and the police was absolutely unaware of the situation. Fortunately, the local correspondent of Aaj Tak, Devesh Pal Singh, who was present there informed a senior police officer even as he recorded a video on his mobile phone. By this time, the mob had already put kerosene on Akram and his pregnant wife in an attempt to burn them alive. The senior officer responded swiftly and sent his forces just in time to save them. Akram is now recuperating in a hospital. Just 50 metres from here, BJP MP Rajveer Singh, along with a few other legislators, district magistrate and police officers were at the residence of Chandan Gupta, requesting them to cremate Chandan's body, but the family was struck to their demand of \"status of martyrdom\" for their dead son. The deadlock ended around 2am after the family was given verbal assurance of a government job to a family member and Rs 50 lakh as compensation. However, three days after his death, Chandan's family has received a cheque of Rs 20 lakh. On January 27, Chandan was cremated in the morning and even as his mortal remains were set on the pyre, Kasganj continued to burn. Around 200 meters from the cremation ground, one bus and a shop were set on fire while some locals vandalised a garage. Minutes later, three more buses and three shops were set ablaze by them. All the shops and vehicles were owned by the local Muslim population who till one day ago were living peacefully with the Hindus.  What was shocking was that these incidents were taking place within a range of 500 metres from where hundreds of policemen and two companies of paramilitary forces were standing guard.  As we witnessed, it appeared that a section of the locals belonging to a particular community were given a free hand by the local administration, allowing them to go on a rampage against the minorities.   Parliamentarian Rajveer Singh in a statement to us blamed the Muslims for the clashes. \"Muslims are responsible for this incident. It was pre-planned and they will be dealt with strict action,\" he said. Virendra Tomar, VHP leader, said, \"It's time for us to give a fitting reply to \"love jihad\". If they kill one of us, we will kill 10 of them. The police is our servant and they will work on our instructions.\" After several incidents of violence since the morning of January 27, the mob, led by a local VHP leader, took on the policemen. With no courage to face the crowd, a senior police officer called a VHP leader and requested him to ask their cadres to vacate the streets. The VHP leader agreed to the officer's request, but while walking away, he warned the police that within 48 hours, they will ensure that Kasganj is on fire. The political conspiracy was quite clear following the clashes which started on January 26. Now, there was only pressure from the innocent locals and media on the administration and police officers to act.  On January 28, when we confronted the suprintendent of police, Sunil Singh (who has now been transferred), as to why they failed to control the situation, he categorically said, \"This is being done on the instructions of a few people (higher-ups) and I cannot rule out any political conspiracy.\" His statement on camera probably cost him his job as he was transferred from Kasganj. Politics over Kasganj violence is at its peak with BJP and VHP leaders making controversial remarks, and parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party blaming the BJP for polarisation for the upcoming elections. In this political tussle, the ones suffering are the common people. Situated on the banks of Kala Nadi (Black river), most of the population in Kasganj is dependent on daily business for their survival. With a population of little above one million, Kasganj district has approximately 66 per cent Hindus and 33 per cent Muslims. And in last one decade, there has been no incident of any communal violence. Five days on, Kanganj continues to simmer while politicians are busy trying to cash in on communal sentiments.  ","date":"2018-01-31","tag":"Republic Day,Mohammad Akram,Yogi Adityanath,Kasganj violence","title":"How politics is fanning the communal flames in Kasganj","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kasganj-violence-mohammad-akram-pregnant-wife-district-magistrate-sunil-singh-transferred-yogi-adityanath/story/1/22090.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15292},{"author":"AVM Manmohan Bahadur","content":"Technological asymmetry has been an understated cog that goes into deciding victors in interstate conflicts — for, it is finally the image of a victorious soldier, sailor or airman that lingers — on in human memory. While the \"man behind the machine\" is important, there comes a stage where the superiority of warfighting implements overcomes the prowess of a warrior. We have witnessed that when the bow and arrow overcame the mightiest of land warriors only to be overcome itself by the lance; the bow, lance, sword, shield et al were steamrolled when gun powder came on the scene. And so has been the story over centuries leading to tanks, submarines and now air power, whose instruments have become deciding factors in winning battles and affecting the way war progresses. Adverse technological asymmetry has been fatal down history; India is in the dangerous position of getting on the wrong side of the tech asymmetry curve vis-a-vis its neighbours, especially China — this should be lighting up red bulbs in South Block. The Chinese military-industrial complex has matured to a point where it has become the world’s third largest major arms exporter. Though this is especially true in the field of air defence systems, UAVs and mid-capability fighter and transport aircraft. While the J-20 stealth aircraft has been inducted (production rate being ramped to 36 aircraft per year) and is going through its operational paces, there are reports that the J-31 is being converted to become a carrier borne stealth fighter. This would affect Indian naval power adversely as there are no reports of a corresponding development for the Indian Navy, which is still debating after the shelving of the Naval Tejas programme, whether to get more trouble prone MiG-29K for the indigenous aircraft carrier or some other foreign aircraft. The Chinese have produced the sixth Y-20 Very Heavy Transport Aircraft which will become the mainstay of long range airlift as well as the base aircraft for AWACS and inflight refuelling. They have tied up with the Russians for making a new Advanced Heavy Lift helicopter for the Tibetan plateau and have bought from Ukraine, lock stock and barrel, rights to the world’s biggest transport aircraft, the An-225. The massive airlift capability that will accrue to the PLA can well be imagined! Secure communications, that are so vital in war, will become their forte with research being done in quantum technology. Similar advancements are happening in the land and naval armament arena but the advantage that India presently has with its superior aircraft and aircrew over its Northern frontiers may be slowly slipping away. Air power assets do not come cheap and it is necessary that a nation, vying for a seat at the table of the powerful, commits enough monies towards their acquisition. While the depleting squadron strength of the IAF is being regularly debated, it is the other equally vital aspects too that merit government’s attention. We have only three AWACS and six Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and no additional ones on the horizon. This writer is witness to the selection of a new FRA in 2009, but the proposal was shot down on \"high\" costs. The reshoot of the project met a similar fate five years hence and now we have floated another tender last week! Will this be cheaper now? No way! Reports from HAL about the ramping up of Tejas are not encouraging and prototype testing of the Tejas Mk1A, eighty-three of which will be bought, is some distance away. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft seems a mirage while the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft project is still on the drawing board. The real silver lining is the transport aircraft and helicopter fleets of the IAF that constitute a very potent airlift capability, but these aircraft too are all imported – hopefully, their maintenance contracts are being addressed in time to have adequate availability on the flight line. A healthy combat-ready flight line demonstrates the deterrence that air power affords a nation. The forthcoming national budget is awaited with great anticipation by the armed forces. Technological asymmetry should not be allowed to handicap our first-rate war fighters. : The Economic Survey for 2017-18 brings out the startling fact that India spends only 0.7 per cent of its GDP on Research & Development while China spends 2.1 per cent, the US 2.8 per cent and Israel 4.3 per cent. If the R&D spend is worked out in monetary terms the huge difference between China and India would be abundantly clear as Beijing’s GDP is five times India’s. It is a no-brainer that this is a clear indicator of the fact that technological asymmetry would only increase unless some radical steps are urgently taken by the government to ameliorate the imbalance.

After all, pooh-poohed its strategic experts, the first iteration a decade ago was short-lived and fizzled out. The Quad’s second coming, however, has so far appeared more robust — or robust enough to concern Beijing. Two top officials who travelled to Delhi in December — state councillor Yang Jiechi and foreign minister Wang Yi — both made oblique references to the danger of “small groups” getting together with the aim of containing others. They both also referred to what they saw as unhelpful meddling by the US in the South China Sea and hoped India would continue its “independent” foreign policy. So, when four top naval officials of the Quad countries took the stage together in Delhi in January’s Raisina Dialogue, Beijing duly saw red. Especially when the commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, openly called China a disruptor, and Japan’s naval chief Admiral Kawano called for countries to come together to counter Chinese naval expansionism amid muscle-flexing in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The hawkish Chinese tabloid   wrote that “the Raisina Dialogue was elaborately planned to serve as a platform for countries like the US, Japan and Australia, to show their tough stance towards China and Russia, and meanwhile demonstrate India’s position of trying to balance between Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region, in addition to India’s independent major power status and dissatisfaction with China.” The unprecedented joint attendance of 10 ASEAN leaders, days later at the Republic Day parade in Delhi, further deepened the angst in Beijing, with the same newspaper in an editorial raging that “some members of the Indian elite enjoy engaging in geopolitical bluster. But they cannot truly gauge the reality of India’s comprehensive strength and diplomatic experience. They are beginners playing at geopolitics.” “New Delhi is not Beijing’s major trading partner, and, despite border disputes, is not an imminent security threat to us Chinese,” the editorial said. “However, some Indians keep pestering us, asking us to acknowledge that India is developing better than China.” New Delhi, with a GDP that’s only one-fifth of China’s, has been striving to prevail over Beijing in almost all aspects.” It concluded, “Honestly speaking, Chinese people are not occupied by India.” But apparently occupied enough to warrant a stream of concerned editorials in the state media.

Both Dalit leaders - one from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the other from Gujarat - they are charismatic young men who offer possibilities of a new and vibrant Dalit movement in a national landscape as riven by caste as ever. Both are lawyers, both are Ambedkarite - Azad more than Mevani - and both are modern rationalists in the Ambedkarite tradition. To be sure, they are not Dalit Panthers. Azad, despite the fact that he calls his group an army, spends most of his efforts on ensuring education for Dalit children. Mevani works to ensure land officially belonging to Dalits is returned to them. Both are constitutional leaders, believers in the rule of law, anti-violence and careful to defuse any situation that has the potential to turn violent. Despite widespread claims that both either incite or actually preach violence they have been against stoking of conflict between Dalits and Muslims or retaliatory actions against upper caste violence. It is symptomatic of our times that despite this, both are seen as terrifying threats to the Indian state, the media and the right wing middle and upper castes and classes in India - all of which amount to the same thing really.  chief Azad is in jail under a battery of false cases since June 2017. More recently the UP government has   under the National Security Act, an absurd law to invoke in his case. Mevani is constantly attacked in the media, especially since he joined electoral politics and won a seat in Vadgam, Gujarat. Recently he came under fire for refusing to entertain Republic TV in Chennai and for offering a critical appraisal of BR Ambedkar which was predictably and deliberately taken out of context. Why are the two such threats despite being no more than militant liberals? Part of the answer lies in the fact that they have an Ambedkarite pride in their Dalit identity and are very clear that it is their right and duty not to be quiet in the face of caste-based abuse and exploitation. In the feudal state of Uttar Pradesh, Azad and Mevani have emerged as a formidable challenge at a time the threat posed by the   lost both substance and direction. The BJP therefore considers it important to quash them and their politics at all costs. In the deeply communal Gujarat, the mobilisation of Dalits and Muslims by a dynamic leader can spell doom for the dominant BJP. The recent elections and Mevani's thumping victory was a taste of that destabilising effect for the dominant party. Both men are also articulate and not fooled by any of the smokescreen discourses of the dominant party. If Mevani is the more urbane and suave of the two, Azad has a clarity born from being grounded in his location and a compassion that gives his home-grown north Indian machismo an unusual edge. This is why both are an anathema to the mostly inarticulate, unintelligent leaders of the dominant, or indeed, any party. Both men came to prominence over democratic contestations of violence against Dalits. In Mevani's case, it was the atrocity in Una; in Azad's case the atrocity in Shabbirpur. This is really at the heart of the hatred, fear and resentment directed against the two. They are not going to remain silent about atrocities against Dalits and their responses to it are not reactive but proactive, collective and systematic. Mevani has openly spoken in support of Azad, particularly after his arrest. The combination of the two men is more frightening than taking on them individually. Mevani has the theoretical tools and a critical engagement with history, Ambedkarite and otherwise. His speech taken out of the context by the media recently shows that he is neither hagiographic about Ambedkar nor his Communist heroes and knows that historical circumstances have changed and so must theories, even as his primary commitment to their vision remains. Azad has a hands-on engagement with the community which forms the foundation of his politics but his vision is resolutely and uncritically Ambedkarite. Both have much to offer each other and what is important is that both are cognisant of the need to combine theoretical vision and grassroots politics. Mevani sees himself as a social movement activist; Azad sees himself as putting Ambedkarite thinking into action. Both have much to say to each other. But with a hostile state, media and middle class combine, things are not easy for them. The internet Ambedkarites are mostly silent about them, when not critical of them. That is the privilege of internet activists. They do not have to get their hands dirty. It is important for us to nurture these two young men. They are by no means perfect but they are the best we have. On gender, their thinking has not gone very far. On the issue of politics of sexuality, they have not thought much. Neither of them is in touch with his subconscious - both deal mainly with the rational and the legal/constitutional - but it is our duty to widen the scope of their vision. In the mindlessly neoliberal, rabidly anti-intellectual and activism-phobic times we live in, they are reminders that not all is lost. Not fooled by hyper nationalism, grounded in local struggles and unafraid to stand up for who they are, Chandrashekhar Azad and Jignesh Mevani might well be the reasons for us to start thinking again. That they are both really handsome and hot is just an added bonus.","date":"2018-01-29","tag":"Jignesh Mevani,Chandrashekhar Azad,Bhim Army,Dalit politics","title":"Why everyone feels threatened by Jignesh Mevani and Chandrashekhar Azad","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrashekhar-azad-jignesh-mevani-dalit-politics-vadgam-gujarat-bhim-army-br-ambedkar/story/1/22046.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15295},{"author":"Ashok Upadhyay","content":"Speaking at the 70th foundation day of the  (NCC), prime minister Narendra Modi said no one would be spared in his drive against corruption. Seeking cooperation of the youth in the battle against corruption and black money, the PM said, “I don’t think any youth of my country is now willing to tolerate corruption. The hate for corruption in the society is visible… I want you to help end corruption that is like a termite.\" Countering the general perception that the rich and the powerful mostly get away while the poor get the short shrift in corruption cases, the PM said, “The country used to discuss corruption in despair, the lament being 'no one catches the powerful'. Three former chief ministers are now rotting in jail. Who says there is no justice? No one will be spared.\" The prime minister was talking about the three former chief ministers who are currently in jail. While former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra have been convicted and sentenced in cases related to the fodder scam, former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala is serving a jail term following conviction in a recruitment scam. Three former chief ministers landing in jail on graft charges is certainly unprecedented in seven decades of independent India as far as corruption is concerned. It is also not the norm in a country where the general perception is that the powerful political class is never punished, and are above the law. But going by how the prime minister placed the issue in his speech, it may seem like it was his government which ensured the conviction of these powerful people. But is that truly the case? Let us first talk about the fodder scam cases. In March 1996, the CBI was brought into the case as per the Supreme Court’s order. Lalu Yadav was named as accused in six cases.  The central investigation agency filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused in 1997.  On 30 September 2013, a special CBI court in Ranchi convicted former Lalu Prasad Yadav and Jagannath Mishra along with 44 others in the case. The court had announced a sentence of five years for Lalu Yadav and four years for Jagannath Mishra. On January 6, Lalu Yadav was again convicted in another fodder scam case and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. On January 24, a special CBI court in Ranchi awarded five years jail to Lalu Yadav and Jagannath Mishra, this being the third case in which verdict has been pronounced. Barring orders by the courts in the last two cases, nothing has happened after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister of India. So his or his government’s role is certainly not a factor in sending Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra to jail. In the teacher’s recruitment scam case, in which former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala has been convicted, started in 2003. The Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe. In June 2008, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the court of special CBI judge against 62 people including OP Chautala. In January 2013, the court convicted Chautala and sent him to jail for 10 years. So Om Prakash Chautala was already in jail by the time Modi became the prime minister. It is very clear from the facts that in none of the three court cases involving the three former chief ministers did Modi or his government has a role to play. So while decrying corruption, the PM forgot to clarify that the credit for putting these powerful politicians behind bars was not his for the taking.  Is this not a form of moral corruption, or did the PM not realise what he was implying?","date":"2018-01-30","tag":"Fodder Scam,Black Money,Narendra Modi,Corruption","title":"Modi may be hitting corruption hard, but what has jail for 3 former CMs to do with him?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/corruption-bjp-modi-black-money-fodder-scam-lalu-yadav-jagannath-mishra-op-chautala/story/1/22062.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15296},{"author":"Harsh Mander","content":"Our second day of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018 was India’s 67th Republic Day. We spent this day travelling in remote rural Bengal, meeting families of three young men who were lynched, and their bodies mutilated and dismembered. This was one more lynching in the country that was celebrated by videotaping the killing and circulating the recording triumphantly on social media. It was claimed at that time, by the crowds, the police and even representatives of the ruling party, that a mob of villagers killed them because they were cow thieves. The story we heard in our travels was all too familiar, one troublingly similar to those that we have heard over and over again in the eight states to which the Karwan has travelled so far. It was the evening of the 27th roza fast of Ramazan in Eid on   midsummer last year. Three friends in three different villages in the North Bengal district of Uttar Dinajpur were enjoying the special Iftar meal to break their fasts with their families, in anticipation of the Eid celebrations that were to follow. The friends were all in their mid-twenties. Two were day labourers ready to do any work that was locally offered to them – construction work, farm labour, tea leaf plucking, and whatever else came their way; one was trying to set up a small business. All the three friends were married, with small children. Each of their families reported to us that their mobile phones rang while they were eating. Each said that the young men initially said to whoever called that they were reluctant to leave their family celebrations but finally conceded. They speculate that because the three of them often took petty construction assignments together, perhaps this was what they were called away so urgently for. But they now have no way of knowing for sure. Two of the young men left on their bikes, one walked and was picked up some distance away. They did not return that night. The next morning, each of the families was summoned to the police station. To collect their sons’ savaged bodies, dead and mutilated after mob lynching. The first family we met was in the village Dhulagoch. The young man Nasruddin’s ageing father, Yasin Mohammed, with a white beard, white singlet and blue lungi customary for men of his age, met us weeping. For the hour that we were with him, he would not leave my hand. He was joined by his mother, bent over with age and mourning, the boy’s mother, his widow Anisa and their two small children. The entire family sobbed out loud and long as they shared with us the trauma of his loss six months earlier, and the nightmare of what followed. He used to work in Delhi as a truck driver. After a road accident, his father called him back home. It did not matter if he earned less as work was uncertain and low-paid. At least he was safe and close to home. The morning after he did not return home, a policeman of the village came to their home in civil clothes. He showed them a video of a lynching. To their horror, they could recognise that one of the young men being attacked was Nasruddin. They rushed to the police station, only to be handed his bloodied and defaced dead body. The distraught families of his two friends were also there. We met their families as well in the course of our journey today. Nasirul’s mother Masida Begum and wife Marjina in the village Kutipada; and Samiruddin’s widow in the village Kandapora. Nasirul’s widow gave birth to a daughter months after he had died. Two of the bodies of the young men were lying in an ambulance, and a third on a hospital stretcher. They were disfigured and dismembered, with limbs smashed and crushed, and even their genitals stoned. The police would tell them nothing more than that villagers of a neighbouring Hindu village Durgapur had found them stealing cows. They had caught and in their mass fury lynched them. The families were enraged at the charge of their boys being cow thieves. \"Would anyone in their right mind set out to steal cows on motor cycles?\" they asked indignantly. But they reported that the police was rough with them. Two of the post-mortems were completed before the families arrived. One was done with the family present. The police then handed over the bodies to the families. The dazed and grieving families spent their own money to transport the bodies to their home before they confined each to their graves. After their deaths, some local politicians came to see them, and some people from the local media. A local politician announced that he was convinced that the men were indeed cow smugglers, without offering any proof. No senior officials, to offer help or solace. One family reported that the local block office gave them some grain and a bag of rice. Nothing else. We found the families in extreme want, with their able-bodied bread earners suddenly lost. The families were desperate to know the truth of who had killed their sons and husbands so viciously, and why. We looked at the papers of the cases, and found that the police had registered cases under Section 304, of culpable homicide not amounting to murder; and not murder under Section 302.  The faces of the killers and a large crowd of onlookers were clearly visible in the video they circulated. But only three men were ultimately arrested, and released on bail in just a fortnight because of the lenient sections of the Indian Penal Code under which they had been charged. The families went in delegations to the police station, but report that they were roughly tuned away without answers. They claim that the police threatened that they too would be locked up if they made too much trouble. The villages planned a gherao surrounding the police station. But a local representative of the panchayat – the same who said the men were cow smugglers - dissuaded them. He said that if they did this, it would anger their Hindu neighbours, and might result in Hindu-Muslim riots. It was wise, their representative advised them, to remain silent to avoid trouble in which in the end only they would suffer. They finally accepted this counsel – whether out of voluntary restraint, or despair. We decided that we should try to get some answers from the police to the grieving families. We took representatives from each of the three families with us to the Chopra Police Station. We waited for an hour before the circle inspector agreed to see us. We told him about the Karwan, and our concerns for the families whose sons had been lynched, that they were entitled to know the progress in the investigations into the lynching. I also asked if charges of murder had at least now been instituted against the killers. He said he would not speak to us until he had the permission of the district superintendent of police. He spoke to his superior in our presence and then replied that he was not authorised to give us any answers at all. I asked heatedly how as a public servant, he could turn away the families of the bereaved families. But he was adamant. We left Bengal intensely troubled about how deep the poison of communal hatred has penetrated even a part of India that has maintained greater communal peace after Partition than most others. The villagers in all the three villages to which we travelled said that apart from stray and minor incidents, there had before this been no major incidents of communal tension and violence between Hindus and Muslims of the area before this. All of this lies shattered after the lynching of the three young men, aggravated first by the charge that they were cow thieves, and then the refusal of the state administration to extend to them solace, support or justice of any kind. This is a failure also that I feel compelled to point to, of local civil liberty groups and progressive and secular political parties. My greatest disappointment was to observe that the attitude of the state administration to the victim families whose loved ones had been felled by hate violence was no different from that of the administrations of BJP ruled states. I could easily instead have been in Gujarat, or Rajasthan, or Uttar Pradesh, and not West Bengal. The betrayal of governments of political parties that claim to be secular in failing to defend their minorities rankles painfully and erodes the secular promises of India’s constitution. Today’s was a journey made even more painful because we made it on the day that the Indian government was celebrating its republic with displays of its military might and cultural pageantry. The despair and fear in the eyes of the members of the three families we met on this day in Bengal villages revealed how hollowed out are the promises of India’s republic to its most vulnerable citizens, and how weakly we all defend these.","date":"2018-01-27","tag":"Congress,BJP,Bengal,Hate crimes","title":"Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018: Lynchings expose the hollowed out promises of India’s republic","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karwan-e-mohabbat-lynchings-hate-crimes-bengal-bjp-congress/story/1/22013.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15297},{"author":"Kartik Mittal","content":"Last year, the powerful Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly announced a diplomatic and economic blockade against another regional pseudo-ally – the state of  . The four countries led the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in accusing Qatar of supporting and funding terrorism and manipulating internal affairs of its neighbouring states. Widely regarded as the most-advanced Arab state for human development by the UN, 85 per cent of the country’s population comprises expatriates, set against just 313,000 Qatari citizens in a population of 2.6 million. Qatar is also a high-income economy, with the world’s third-largest natural-gas reserves and oil reserves. Qatar, which was abruptly shunned by its immediate neighbours, and had little or no indication of the crisis that began as an extension of the Qatar-Saudi proxy conflict. The involvement of the other regional GCC nations, including Bahrain, Egypt and UAE in the blockade further complicated the position to negotiate, as the quartet had a unified and unwavering stance in dedicating the terms for appeasement. The countries cited Qatar's alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for their action, insisting that Qatar has violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the GCC. The GCC also felt threatened by the media arm of Qatar - Al Jazeera - for engaging in what they termed as a \"media conspiracy\" against the nations, and also for the country’s proximity with Iran. Now entering its eight month, the blockade by the GCC nations effectively amounts to economic sanctions on Qatar, which has rendered  , travel, trade and diplomatic restrictions. The effect of these sanctions has been widespread, crippling several companies operating out of the country, and including its citizens and expatriates. The abrupt notice and enforcement of the sanctions had also meant the country was put in a limbo, freezing several of its regional assets and disrupting everyday operations.   As a small gas-rich nation, Qatar has been balancing its trade with heavy dependence on its oil and gas exports for subsidising its food and industrial imports. With its land border with Saudi Arabia closed, Qatar’s food imports initially dropped substantially, before recovering via expensive alternatives. While the allegations against Qatar’s supposed terror-funding has been the prime focal point, in reality, it is also an extension of the regional differences, especially manifested after the network’s coverage since the 2011 Arab Spring. Al Jazeera, the state-funded broadcaster in Doha, was one of the significant nerve-points in the diplomatic blockade, as the GCC members have over the past continued to express distrust over the network’s coverage of the Arab Spring and for “negatively portraying” the local governments. In fact, the complete shutdown of Al Jazeera was one of the terms put forward jointly by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to even commence negotiations. The direct losses incurred by Qatar, along with the indirect losses, would amount to several billion dollars, and the country is already exploring legal avenues to claim compensation from the GCC countries. Several senior ministers have also indicated that Qatar has contracted a specialised legal team to study the actions taken by the blockading countries against it. The country has also been clear in its position on backing Al Jazeera, effectively ruling out any calls for its shutdown.  While the blockade imposed by the GCC is geo-political, efforts by the members in calling for a wider global support, including from the UN is far-fetched. The issue was momentarily complicated when US President Donald Trump took credit for the Saudi-led actions (which was initiated shortly after his visit to the region), but nevertheless it did not gain any traction as international consensus, including from the European Union and the United Nations, among other nations, had called for the resolution of the diplomatic crisis through dialogue. The gas-rich nation has virtually been cornered over its movements - both financially (for its current instruments/investments in the GCC countries) and physically, having to re-rout its land and sea movements via Iran.     Surprisingly, despite all the extreme measures by the GCC quartet to arm-wrestle Qatar, countries, including the UAE and Oman, continue to depend on Qatar’s gas pipeline to power their infrastructure. Qatar continues to pump around two billion cubic feet of gas per day to the UAE, showing no signs of impact from the sanctions.","date":"2018-01-26","tag":"US,Saudi,GCC,Qatar blockade","title":"US-GCC sanctions: One year on, how Qatar is weathering the crisis","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/qatar-blockade-gcc-saudi-us-al-jazeera-donald-trump-arab-spring/story/1/22006.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15298},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"In the most anticipated speech of the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, the last hurrah as it were, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, outlined his idea of America at the globalist platform, asserting that the two are not at odds with each other. Declaring that \"America First\" - the motto of his nationalist government under the Republican party banner - isn't an automatic route to \"America alone\", Trump dispelled some of the widely held fears that he would hijack WEF's overtly internationalist outlook with his nationalist zeal, upsetting the applecart somewhat.   Instead of railing against the transnational order, Trump trained guns at \"predatory trading practices\", saying each country has the right to safeguard its interests. Hinting at the wide-scale off shoring of jobs and manufacturing by American companies over cheap labour and cost, Trump said he has cut corporate taxes to make America \"open for business\" again, something that wasn't being done since the time of Ronald Reagan, Trump's Republican antecedent.  While the tax cuts are being hotly debated in the US national media, concurrent with other policies of the Trump-led White House, such as depleting medical cover for the poor and the middle classes, immigration tightening and strict regulation of previously lenient visa norms such as the H-1B, etc, the US president waxed eloquent about the stock market boom that has followed since the cuts were announced. Trump also spoke of America being a great investment destination, hard-selling his country against a resurgent Europe under the twin leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump also pitched America as an alternative to obvious Asian markets such as India and China. In fact, parts of Trump's speech sounded similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's keynote address at the opening plenary session on January 23, especially the well-oiled business-friendly pitch. While PM Modi had warned against \"protectionism\", Trump sounded a caveat, saying every country has the right to defend itself economically. However, unlike PM Modi, Trump made no reference to climate change, given his high-profile exit from the Paris climate deal in April last year. He touched upon securing America more in terms of defence spendings, as well as saying that the anti-ISIS coalition has wrested almost 100 per cent of the territories once occupied by the Islamic State.  \r\n \r\n President Trump sounded more sober than his usual bombast, though the claims that he made on employment rates among Hispanics, African-Americans and women can be attributed to the policies of the previous Obama administration with its strong affirmative action push. Similarly, the state of the political economy could be gauged from the fact that on the first anniversary of Trump's swearing-in, there was a US government shutdown because the Congress couldn't agree on a federal budget. Not to mention the bad press that Trump is still getting nationally, with some seriously considering if he can be impeached. That said, the expected grouse against \"fake news\" and \"nasty\" media at a global platform was new for the WEF, even though Trump enjoyed a full house, like always. Trump's speech and later interaction with WEF head Klaus Schwab indicate clearly that his anti-immigration policies will continue unabated, making it increasingly difficult for foreign policy experts in India to negotiate a better deal for the expats and NRIs, increasingly courted back home by all political parties. Does Trump's speech ring alarm bells already? Yes, but they are not as loud as we had made them out to be. ","date":"2018-01-26","tag":"United States of America,World Economic Forum 2018,Davos,Donald Trump","title":"'America First' doesn't mean 'America Alone': What Trump said at World Economic Forum","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/donald-trump-davos-world-economic-forum-2018-united-states-of-america/story/1/22009.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15299},{"author":"Amna Mirza","content":"Diplomatic relations with China have always been a thorny issue as far as India's global outreach programmes are concerned, especially in its efforts to reach out to neighbouring countries. At a time when the US, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has been hinting at  , China is trying to take centre stage with its globalisation plans. To understand how this Chinese stance impacts Indian interests, one must look at Beijing's engagement with neighbouring countries. It's an open secret that China is Pakistan's all-weather ally. However, of late, Beijing has been offering submarines to countries along the Indian Ocean coastlines at lucrative prices. Pakistan and China recently announced they will hold joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean regularly. Reports have also surfaced saying China's third domestic aircraft carrier is   in the Indian Ocean. It is pretty evident that Pakistan has consented to self-destruction by agreeing to be a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and trying to bypass the US' strategic encirclement policy that has a military base in Diego Garcia in Indian Ocean and includes the South China Sea. With Pakistan getting loans at exorbitantly high interest rates, imperialist loot and plunder is pretty evident. China has been pretty ruthless in this game of trying to shift the power balance in its own favour. China has invested several billion dollars in building sea lines of communication through Pakistan running far into the Indian Ocean. This is a difficult target to pursue, but that hasn't deterred China from actually going for it. China was critical of the US moving its   in the South China sea, calling it a violation of its sovereignty, and pledged to take necessary measures to protect the same. Beijing took this stand despite the fact that its ships and submarines keep surfacing near Japanese islands, near Taiwan and in the Indian Ocean. China's clout is not restricted to Pakistan, it is growing in the entire Asian region. The country's role in fomenting trouble in Maldives is well-known. Exiled Maldivian Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed termed Chinese property deals in Maldives as \"land grab\". Chinese influence actually stretches to as far as Australia. It is being said that Beijing's rising display of might in South Asia is in response to India's outings in Southeast Asia. It is indeed great that India can work closely with other nations which are joined by the common thread of Chinese aggression in the region. New Delhi can especially draw support from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Even though India has been mindful of the Chinese threat, it needs to shore up greater support given that the challenge from Beijing is growing increasingly formidable.","date":"2018-01-25","tag":"Pakistan,CPEC,Donald Trump,Chinese aggression","title":"India must forge deeper ties with ASEAN nations to counter China in Indian Ocean","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chinese-aggression-donald-trump-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-cpec-maldives-pakistan/story/1/21980.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15300},{"author":"Kaveree Bamzai","content":"That the right wing in India has no sense of history is being proven daily on the streets of cities across India as Karni Sena and its clones threaten the screening of  . They want to ban a movie they have not seen. And they want to protest the depiction of their clan though they do not know details of how it is portrayed. This is in keeping with their lack of knowledge of history. Or rather, as Audrey Truschke points out in an earlier  for  , the skewed colonial history that was taught to us all. As she notes: \"The story of how Aurangzeb became India’s most maligned king begins in the British colonial period. In brief, the British wanted to point to Indian rulers who were even worse than themselves in order to justify the horrors of colonialism. So they painted a skewed picture of Aurangzeb, often misrepresenting his alleged worst crimes. Many Hindu nationalists today think that hating Aurangzeb is a distinctively Indian feeling, but such sentiments are perhaps more aptly described as a colonial inheritance.\" For the right wing, Aurangzeb is seen as the epitome of everything evil. Not only do they see him as a destroyer of temples (though he built more temples than he destroyed), but also as the man who imposed the dreaded jizya tax and disliked music and art. In asking for the boycott of  , the RSS has shown that it is no less than Aurangzeb - they hate the very thing he is said to have abhorred. So, do we become what we hate most? It would seem so. No matter that Aurangzeb's name is sought to be erased by the BJP from Indian history (though he ruled quite successfully for almost half a century) and that no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his name when he spoke disparagingly of Rahul Gandhi recently, he has become the epitome of what a \"bad Muslim\" can be. So, if we are to believe the history that has been taught to us, and is now forwarded through WhatsApps, we should assume the RSS and Karni Sena are Aurangzeb's true heirs. That is also not quite true though - music wasn’t proscribed even in Aurangzeb’s court. The emperor’s own coronation anniversaries were marked by both musicians and dancers. Not only that, his patronisation of music meant that a number of dhrupads were composed in his name. In the  , Bahktawar Khan wrote of the Emperor having a “perfect expert's knowledge” of music. In  , Alauddin Khilji is shown as feeding those pages of history to fire that don't bear his name. If history were to be rewritten to suit those in power, we would have as many versions of it as we have had rulers. Will burning buses and protesting at cinema halls change Rajput history? The irony is that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a film that celebrates every virtue the Rajputs hold dear - including a very emotive sequence at the end when Rani Padmavati leads her army of women into the flames, choosing jauhar over falling into the arms of Khilji. Every community has its own idea of its special status. The Rajputs certainly are entitled to it - and, in fact, the movie celebrates that, with Ratan Singh saying \" ,   Rajput;   Rajput;   Rajput.\" If their objection is that the film portrays a sort of \"love jihad\", they couldn't be more wrong. Arjun Appadurai speaks of the \"fear of small numbers\", the idea that a small minority is standing in the way of a great people from fully embracing their nationalism. It is exactly what is happening here. Khilji's existence is supposed to stand in the way of Rajput's embracing their idea of who they are, or ought to be. Now if that is not a majoritarian mindset, what is?

The National Defence Strategy (NDS) is an important document which encapsulates the Trump administration’s defence policies in one place for the first time. The NDS bluntly describes a US military that is losing its edge over potential competitors, and urges “increased and sustained investment” for “long-term strategic competitions specifically with China and Russia”. The NDS also identifies three theatres of engagement for the US: the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the West Asia that is consistent with what the Obama administration had been doing towards the end. While the NDS specifically points out that “China is a strategic competitor which is using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours while militarising features in the South China Sea”, the document blames Russia of violating the borders of nearby nations and pursuing veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbours. The unclassified synopsis of NDS 2018 acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment, characterised by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations. The NDS states in clear terms about growing Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and states on China \"continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to pursue a military modernization programme that seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future”. The Trump administration had also released its first National Security Strategy (NSS) last month on December 18, 2017. In principle, the strategy which has been outlined in the NSS document charts out the strategic objectives of Trump’s administration and also the ways to meet those strategic aims. The NSS document describes the Indo-Pacific region as the most populous and economically dynamic part of the world and maps it as a stretch from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States and reinforces its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance with international law in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS reflects a growing consensus in the US that China is an adversary. The document is a frank acknowledgment of widely shared concerns about China’s rise. It is important here to note that the approach of Trump administration is a far cry from the Obama administration’s 2015 NSS which had welcomed the rise of a “peaceful” and “prosperous” China. In future, a sharp deterioration of China-US ties cannot be ruled out, especially if Washington perceives Beijing as a hindrance when it comes to resolving the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. The Trump administration’s complaint of China’s bullying of other States using “economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats,” echoes fears spreading from Asia to Europe. In the Indo-Pacific region, as far as New Delhi is concerned, the NSS “welcomes India’s emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic and defence partner”. On the future course of action in the bilateral partnership between the US and India, the document mentions that the US will expand its defence and security cooperation with India which is a major defence partner of the United States, and will also support India’s growing relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific region. There is a specific mention in the document of the much-talked and debated “quadrilateral partnership” among the US, Japan, India and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region, and the NSS puts its stamp on it by mentioning the “Quad” for \"free and open Indo-Pacific\". On the issue of maritime cooperation, Washington has time and again shown its willingness to deepen its strategic partnership with New Delhi and support India’s leadership role in Indian Ocean security and throughout the broader region which is reflective in the cooperation in the Malabar naval exercise. Terrorism in South Asia is one of the biggest challenges among other geopolitical issues and in a direct reference to it, the NSS states that “the US will press Pakistan to intensify the counterterrorism efforts, since no partnership can survive a country’s support for militants and terrorists who target a partner’s own service members and officials”. Overall, the hypothesis of the NSS is based on the principle of realism in international relations as it defines the international system as one of great power competition in which the document specifically points out about Russia and China and portray them as “revisionist powers” challenging the status quo and identifies both the nations as strategic competitors or opponents of the United States. The NSS also criticises past several decades of US foreign policy approach and points out that in past it was shaped by the misguided belief that \"engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners\". This kind of realist framework in the conceptual context needs to be welcomed because it was long overdue departure from previous and successive administrations of the US. Interestingly, the NSS neither makes any mention of China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative nor mentions about the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together has the potential for a parallel Sino-centric sphere of influence in future. The US needs to shed its obsession with zero-sum trade reciprocity and should come out with a coherent and comprehensive geo-economics strategy if it wants to preserve the US-led rules-based order and counter China’s grand strategy to carve out a parallel Sino-centric order or sphere of influence.  ","date":"2018-01-25","tag":"Defence deals,India-US Ties,US defence strategy","title":"What Trump's new national defence and security strategies mean for India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/us-national-defence-strategy-security-india-us-ties-defence-trump-obama-administration/story/1/21979.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15302},{"author":"Minhaz Merchant","content":"The   between the chief justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and four Supreme Court collegium justices - J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph - gets curiouser by the day. Despite several meetings to reconcile their differences, the gulf between India’s seniormost justices has not narrowed. What precisely are those differences? At their press conference and in their seven-page letter, the four collegium justices were vague in their demands. For those who want linguistic clarity and brevity from our finest judicial minds, the letter gives little indication of either. Sample this: “ But if all Supreme Court justices are equals, why shouldn’t cases, sensitive or not, be assigned to benches led by “junior” Supreme Court judges? No clear answer has been forthcoming. So what do the four rebel justices really want? First, they want the case relating to the death of judge BH Loya reassigned. That wish has been fulfilled. Justice Arun Mishra was hearing the Loya case. Rattled by the events of last week, he recused himself. The CJI, in a show of authority, reassigned the case to a bench headed by himself. He was under relentless pressure to reassign the Loya case to a bench headed by one of the four collegium justices. He did not. Instead, he even transferred the two PILs related to the case pending in the Bombay High Court to his own bench. Last week, the petitioners’ senior counsel Dushyant Dave had pleaded “with folded hands” against the CJI doing that. The CJI brushed aside Dave’s plea. A group of lawyers and politicians are using the  , as they had earlier used the  , to target BJP president Amit Shah. The confrontation between the Maharashtra government’s counsel Harish Salve and Dave in the CJI’s court on January 22, brought this out into the open. Dave claimed that Salve had defended Shah in the past and should not appear in the Loya case due to conflict of interest. The charge was summarily rejected by the CJI’s three-judge bench.   Salve has, meanwhile, submitted medical documents and other material to the Supreme Court to show that judge Loya’s death occurred due to natural causes. The CJI has posted the next hearing in the case for February 2. But amid the judge Loya clamour, the case that lurks in the background is about building the  . Like Banquo’s ghost that haunted Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Ram temple case haunts the Supreme Court. The long drawn-out case is now with a bench headed by the CJI. He retires on October 2, 2018. There is an expectation that the CJI wants to deliver a verdict in the case before he demits office. The same powerful group of lawyers, activists, politicians and sections of the media that has shown exceptional interest in the judge Loya case fears that the CJI could be inclined to rule in favour of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque stood. Such a ruling would benefit the BJP in three big states due to go to the polls in December 2018: Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. All three states will feature binary BJP-Congress contests. All three face strong anti-incumbency. A pro-temple ruling would give the BJP a steroid boost ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.  Two outcomes can now be divined. First, a chastened CJI, buffeted by the collegium’s rebellion, will postpone a verdict on the Ram temple case till after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, citing its sensitivity. Second, the CJI could rule against  building the Ram temple where the Babri mosque stood and instead suggest the construction of two new structures, a temple and a mosque, side by side. That would suit the Opposition ahead of 2019. All of these well-laid plans though may amount to nothing. Even if the Supreme Court’s verdict goes against building the Ram temple, or the verdict is inordinately delayed, the anger that it will spark among devout Hindus will be electorally fissile. In the end, therefore, the elaborate shenanigans we have been witness to in the Supreme Court over the past two weeks could end in a whimper. But the spotlight it has shone on the apex court and its hallowed innards will have served a purpose.  Why, for example, haven’t the senior justices of the Supreme Court shown similar ire, as they have over assignment of cases, against the real issues that bedevil India’s judicial system: deep-seated corruption, shambolic infrastructure, a mounting backlog of cases, lawyers holding clients to ransom with adjournments, and the opaque collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court by other Supreme Court judges? Such opacity hardly inspires confidence in India’s top judicial minds as they wrestle with the fissure within their ranks and Banquo’s ghost that hovers silently over the unbuilt Ram temple in Ayodhya.","date":"2018-01-24","tag":"Amit Shah,Modi,Elections,Ram mandir","title":"Why Ram temple issue is lurking behind crisis in Supreme Court","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-judge-loya-ram-mandir-2019-modi-amit-shah-congress/story/1/21953.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15303},{"author":"Aruna Chandrasekhar","content":"Given the surreal times that we live in, it's always reassuring to hear world leaders reaffirm that climate change is still real for them.

Modi's call for rich nations to do their bit and arguments against protectionism struck the right notes, as developed countries must demonstrate they can put their money where their mouth is, beginning with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol which turned 20 last year. India deserves, and is due to all, the finance and technology in helping it fulfil its most daring gigwatt goals, and to build climate adaptation capacity. But this must be finance that is easy to access. To win a project under  , for instance, is nearly impossible, making one wonder what Make In India the government is hoping to seed fund from its unique carbon tax. While the international press saw Modi's protectionism diatribe as directly   America-centricism - the latest being a 30 per cent tariff imposed on foreign-made solar cells and modules - the Indian government is currently mulling imposing one, putting Operation Suryanamaskar's success in peril. For Modi to invoke Mahatma Gandhi's spin on natural resources while making an elevator pitch at Davos was a stretch even by his standards. For one, his government's continued expansion of Coal India's mines towards a 1.5 billion target has been the opposite of the kid-glove-meets-swadeshi kind of trusteeship,   to forcibly grab indigenous land, while  that allow for local trustees to have any say in the matter. Two, his government's coal auction regime has not been a vast improvement, with ghosts of cartelisation returning, conflicts around land and pollution that were never   and mines unable to get off the ground. Instead, contract mining has become the default way to go, with the state taking on the bidding and regulatory prep work, while private miners like the   rake in the profits without the exposure. By the looks of it, neither   nor   have benefitted the least from three and a half years of Modi's custodianship. If Modi really wants Davos and the world to believe in India taking the lead on climate change, he needs to shed his telling proximity to the fossil fuel industry, acknowledge and fix the haze at home, announce the no-go zones in India's forests and wetland buffers, strengthen laws that empower communities with the lowest carbon footprint and make clean energy R&D accessible, without doing away with essential laws and protections.  All else is \"pawanmuktasana\" for the international press.","date":"2018-01-24","tag":"India,Climate change,Davos,PM Modi","title":"Why Prime Minister Modi's talk of climate change in Davos was hogwash","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/davos-pm-modi-climate-yoga-change-pollution-trump-indias-coal-culture-clean-energy/story/1/21948.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15304},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"Uddhav Thackeray was searching for a “villain” he could blame for the Shiv Sena’s decision to go solo in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He found one in the form of BJP national president Amit Shah. Thackeray claims that Shah sidelined the other constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) while setting a target of 380 seats for the next Lok Sabha election. “Why the astonishment over Shiv Sena’s stand to go solo in the elections?” Thackeray asked in party mouthpiece   on January 24. Thackeray compares the Shiv Sena with the army of Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji: “The Maratha warrior didn’t worry about the vast empires of the Muslim rulers, their unlimited sources of wealth even though he himself didn’t have enough money to pay his army men.” However, it seems he has not taken lessons from Shivaji’s guerrilla war tactics. True to his impulsive nature, Thackeray has revealed his strategy much before the country can go into the election mode. He has given the BJP ample time to formulate its strategy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election without his party’s support. Interestingly, it was the BJP that had kept Thackeray in the dark about the future of their alliance when the former had unilaterally announced a break up two days before the nomination for Assembly polls began in September 2014. “A mature leader never lets his rivals know his strategy much in advance. Uddhavji should have waited for some time,” says a Shiv Sena leader. Voters will not trust Thackeray’s intention to take on the BJP until he proves his credibility by quitting the coalition government. His criticism regarding the government’s failure on issues like loan waiver to farmers will not carry weight till he remains a key player of the government. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have begun chiding him for sticking to power rather than dismantling the alliance. Traditionally, the Thackerays are not known to be open-hearted. Shiv Sena workers are not sure whether they will get monetary support from the party for their work during elections. Around six months ago, the Shiv Sena had fielded Tanaji Sawant, a wealthy Mumbai-based businessman, in the Legislative Council elections from the faraway Yavatmal constituency, declining loyal but poor workers the opportunity to contest polls. Sawant secured a comfortable victory that upset party loyalists. Bring this into the equation, and it is highly possible Thackeray will choose candidates with money instead of those who have been toiling for the party for many years. Ordinary Shiv Sena workers have gone into political hibernation since Thackeray joined the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in December 2014. The chief does not have any programme to infuse enthusiasm into them. The moment any Shiv Sena worker expresses his dissent over the functioning of the government, a patent question is thrown at him: why is he complaining if he is a part of the government? The Shiv Sainiks have been caught in a Catch-22 situation. They feel they are in the government but the BJP has ensured that they do not get any benefit of the power. Thackeray will have to come up with a detailed roadmap to revive the party — at present, he does not have any. Thackeray has announced that Shiv Sena will contest elections in every state on the Hindutva plank. The ground reality, however, paints no rosy picture. In Maharashtra, north Indians and Gujaratis will vote for the BJP on the Hindutva plank as the Shiv Sena has time and again taken a hard stand against these communities. For north Indians, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is a bigger Hindutva icon than Thackeray. The Gujaratis do not consider anyone Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s equal — he remains the biggest Hindutva idol. The Marathi-speaking voters, on the other hand, will rally behind the Shiv Sena as they are divided in other parties — BJP, Congress and the NCP. It is important to note that Hindutva supporters disapprove of Thackeray’s growing closeness with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee whom they consider anti-Hindutva owing to her politics of appeasement. The Shiv Sena is not a dominant force outside the Konkan and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra. In Mumbai, it will have a close contest with the BJP should the two parties fight the polls separately. Thackeray has failed to take Shiv Sena to new heights in western Maharashtra, north Maharashtra and Vidarbha, the regions where half of the Assembly seats are consolidated. Uddhav’s decision to go solo in the election is certainly aimed at energising depressed Shiv Sena workers, but it will not get him sweeping power. Who will he blame then?","date":"2018-01-24","tag":"Shiv Sena,Lok Sabha elections 2019,Uddhav Thackeray,Maharashtra","title":"Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to go without BJP in 2019 general elections will be disastrous","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uddhav-thackeray-shiv-sena-lok-sabha-elections-2019-maharashtra/story/1/21949.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15305},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"The   could well be mistaken for the latest season of \"MasterChef Karnataka\". What else explains the obsession of both the Congress and the BJP to reduce the political battle to all things culinary? At a time when the man on the street is grappling with bread and butter issues, the political cooks are serving him beef biryani instead. The B-word was introduced into the Kannada electoral lexicon by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who many in the BJP believe is the man who could ensure distribution of laddoos on verdict day in May 2018. He slammed his Karnataka counterpart Siddaramaiah, mocking his Hindu self, deriding his choice to   despite his religious identity. The Congress hit back with a video that spoke of how Yogi is a recipe that the BJP has prepared to stir trouble in Karnataka. The video made references to the criminal cases against Yogi and the BJP was not amused. Plagiarism is the name of the game so a week later, the BJP too chose the same culinary metaphor to show Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao as chefs, out to prepare beef biryani. The ingredients in this case, according to the makers of the video, included \"illegal beef from a slaughterhouse\", \"rotten rice\" given as part of the PDS, the inability to solve the Cauvery and Mahadayi river water sharing crisis, killings of Hindu youths and alleged corruption in the building of a steel flyover in Bengaluru. But the real reason behind calling it \"beef biryani\" was to stress the appeasement of the minorities under Siddaramaiah. On Monday, the Congress beefed up its rhetoric by expanding the BJP to \"Beef Janata Party\", inspired from Gabbar Singh Tax, perhaps. The attempt was to expose the hypocrisy of the BJP which adopts different positions on consumption of beef in different states. For example, while it does not breathe a word about its anti-beef position in a beef-consuming Meghalaya that goes to polls next month, it wants to put the Congress on the mat in Karnataka by making it a poll issue. The video also spoke of Goa that under BJP's Manohar Parrikar wants to import beef and UP's BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who reportedly runs a meat processing unit. The reason for the BJP raising the decibel levels over its love for the cow goes back five years, when the party was in power in Karnataka. In 2010, the then BJP government had passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill. Siddaramaiah, then in the Opposition had dramatically torn a copy of the Bill, accusing Yeddyurappa of behaving like \"Hitler's regime\" and \"imposing a vegetarian\" culture on the people of Karnataka. His argument was that by banning beef, mutton would become prohibitive. Three years later, when Siddaramaiah became CM, one of his first decisions was to overturn the beef ban. The 1964 Cattle Preservation Act was restored under which slaughter of cows, calves and buffaloes was banned. The Yeddyurappa Bill had banned the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and imposed harsh punishments for violators of the law. By making beef a poll issue, the BJP wants to jog the memory of voters on Siddaramaiah's conduct, hoping to sway the vegetarian Kannadiga and the orthodox Hindu on to its side. This is because even while standing his ground on his right to decide what food will be on his plate, Siddaramaiah has emphasised that he is  . \"There is both Siddha and Rama in my name,'' he declared, raising the spectre of a Gujarat-like temple run in Karnataka by the Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. The Congress, having seen the results of running a Hindu-ised Gujarat campaign, wants to ensure the BJP does not pitch its tent as the sole spokesperson of the Hindus in Karnataka. The BJP's assessment is that controversial planks like beef ban will find traction in pockets of Karnataka, especially the communally sensitive coastal belt. The intention also is to provoke the Muslim voices in the Congress to speak up, so that it will give the BJP a chance to label the ruling party as batting solely for the minorities. So far, the Congress has ensured it does not fall into the trap, trying instead to pick holes in the BJP's policy of different strokes in different states. But what is certain is that the beef recipe will only bring a divisive election on the menu and that won't do Karnataka any good.","date":"2018-01-23","tag":"Congress,BJP,Beef Ban,Karnataka elections","title":"BJP vs Congress: Who will get the beef recipe right in Karnataka polls?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-siddaramaiah-yogi-adityanath-beef-ban-bjp-congress/story/1/21918.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15306},{"author":"Valay Singh Rai","content":"At a dimly lit internet cafe in one of the several urban villages of Delhi, two Class 12 students, sporting latest hairstyles and faux designer labels, are getting their school projects printed. Sushant’s submission is on the Goods and Services Tax (GST); his friend Sumit struggles to translate his project title into English. The irritable cafe owner is in a hurry to move on to his other customers. “Write the title in Hindi -   (the crisis of unemployment),” Sumit tells him.  The boys study in a government school in south Delhi’s Swamy Nagar, a posh neighbourhood that houses many of the 1 per cent Indians who have come to acquire 73 per cent of the wealth generation in India in 2017. The boys on the other hand belong to the 14-18 years age group that constitute 11 per cent (100.2 million) of India’s population of 1.2 billion people. They form a huge chunk of our much-touted (and neglected) demographic dividend of 390 million millennials and the 12 million young people who join the workforce every year. A week ago, the   (ASER) was released by Pratham. Titled \"Beyond Basics\", the latest report is a welcome departure from the past as it looks at rural youth in 14-18 age group, through the lenses of - activity, ability, awareness, and aspirations. Earlier, ASER reports have brought out in stark detail the poor learning levels of children in the schooling system. It is thanks to this annual survey, we now know that while school enrolment has gone up to more than 95 per cent, learning levels of children in government schools are woeful. Most Class 3 students are unable to Class 2-level text. The findings of \" \" are a stinging slap to policymakers and state governments of the 24 states that formed part of the    The worst indictment is for the union government, which has been stubbornly resisting the extension of the Right to Education Act from 14 years to 18 years.  So far, only primary school education in India is a legal right, which is why primary school enrolments have shot up to more than 90 per cent. Groups like the   have been demanding that secondary school education should also be made a legal right as most children tend to \"drop out\" after Class 8. The latest survey confirms once again that the urgent need is to make the entire 12 years of schooling a legal right. The survey has thrown up worrisome trends that belie the media frenzy over Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India, and Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat. Consider this: Out of 100 children in Class 7 only half of them continue to study till Class 10. And only 25 per cent of them go on to complete Class 12. Less than 10 per cent of the youth surveyed in the \"Beyond Basics\" report were enrolled in undergraduate or other degree courses. Nearly 30 per cent of all youth are not enrolled in either a school or any other educational course. The prime minister, who is in   to tell the world’s business tycoons that \"India means business\" ought to bear in mind the complete failure of his government’s Skill India programme. According to the ASER report, only 5 per cent of youth are \"taking some type of vocational training or other courses\". Just 5 per cent. That’s less than the proportion of such youth in Sri Lanka and Nepal, leave alone the rest of the world. For the RSS and its supporters, the ancient golden age of \"Bharat\" is an ever-present model to attract ordinary Indians to their fold. \"India will once again become the world’s teacher\" - this promise is often heard from RSS men, BJP leaders and ministers alike. While a lie can possibly be turned into truth by repeating it ad nauseam, the same doesn’t hold true for grand promises. Last year, the central government  . This month, the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE) once again stalled the demand for the extension of the RTE Act. Moreover, there is a shortage of 9.4 lakh teachers in government schools where the poorest children study. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, only half of all secondary school teacher posts have been filled. In Bihar and Gujarat, one third of them are vacant. Among the other alarming findings of the ASER report is the abysmal \"awareness\" level of India’s rural youth. Less than half of them were unable to locate their own state on the map. Only 64 per cent of them knew that Delhi is India’s capital and nearly 14 per cent of them didn’t recognise India’s map. The prime minister, especially believes in the power of apps and internet, but again, the bulk of India’s youth are deprived of access to the new knowledge-based economy. The   says that  only \"28 per cent had used the internet and 26 per cent had used computers in the last week, while 59 per cent had never used a computer and 64 per cent had never used internet\". If we divide this on the basis of gender, we find that girls are lagging in internet usage also. The report found that, “while 49 per cent  of males have never used the internet, close to 76 per cent of females have never done so”. The proportion of mobile phone users was predictably higher at 73 per cent for all youth, here too more females (22 per cent) had never used a mobile phone as compared to males (12 per cent). If a \"Beyond Basics\" kind of survey is conducted among the youth who scaled the court complex in Udaipur and planted a saffron flag in the wake of the gruesome communal murder of migrant labourer Afrazul, the results are likely to be in consonance with the general findings of the actual report. Incidentally, Udaipur was the only district where the survey was conducted in Rajasthan. The findings for Udaipur are depressing, 96.8 per cent of the youth surveyed were not enrolled in any vocational course, less than half of them could do basic arithmetic, or recognise their own state on the map of India. This pattern repeats itself across different states. The crux of the ASER survey is clear. Most of India’s youth are uneducated, deprived of access to skills of the future, and live in abject hopelessness. In the absence of free and compulsory education till Class 12, many of the rural youth are forced to discontinue their education over reasons ranging from death in the family to the wedding of a sibling even as education is prioritised over practically everything in middle class Indian families. The whole family works in mission mode to ensure that their children ace their competitive exams and join a professional course, while the laggards make up by buying seats in colleges. On the other hand, in the other India which lives in villages and small towns, the youth lives in a deep and dark well which is illuminated by TV and mobile phones. In the absence of role models (40 per cent said they have none), their lives are a dark vacuum which can be easily filled by destructive, if not exhilarating purposes. The demographic dividend is real and inevitable, but are we as a country prepared to constructively engage the youth is the question that should be bothering our government? Because if the government continues to look at school education as business as usual, and ignore education, skills and employability of the future Indian workforce, then the demographic dividend will surely turn into a demographic disaster.","date":"2018-01-23","tag":"RTE,Modi,Demographic dividend,ASER report","title":"India's demographic dividend is turning into a disaster","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-demographic-dividend-aser-education-slap-davos-skill-india-rte/story/1/21919.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15307},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"When he was inducted into the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government in 2014, Chandrakant Patil was considered a man for all seasons because of his ability to handle a number of issues besides his clean image. Three and a half years later, the revenue minister has become the epitome of goof-ups and misplaced priorities. Most recently, Patil found himself at the centre of controversy when he recited a Kannada song praising Karnataka, where he attended the inauguration of a Durga temple in Belgaum district. Patil opened his speech with \"Huttidare Kannada Nadalli Huttabeku (roughly translated as \"One should be born in Karnataka if one is born at all\")\". As expected, the Opposition is demanding Patil’s head for “insulting Maharashtra in Karnataka”. The controversy assumes political relevance owing to Maharashtra's long-pending border dispute with Karnataka. Belgaum is the centrepoint of the chorus for the demand for the merger of Karnataka’s Marathi-speaking border areas with Maharashtra. Patil has effectively given the Opposition an opportunity to target the state government for its “double standards” over the decades-old issue. “We were aware of the BJP’s affection for Gujarat. Now, it has developed love for Karnataka. Chandrakant Patil has stabbed the people of Maharashtra in the back,” said Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar. He even asked for the minister's resignation in a tweet. \r\n \r\n Patil has become a habitual offender when it comes to breaking Marathi hearts. Only two weeks ago, he had raised questions over the competence of BJP workers in the state. Speaking at a conclave of teachers in Beed, Patil had said it had become difficult to find leaders of character for various important posts in the party. “We won’t find such people even if we look for them with binoculars,” he had said, in an apparent dig at \"incompetent\" BJP workers. He had also found himself in a spot in October 2017 when he provided wrong information about the ownership of two flats in the possession of state Congress president Ashok Chavan’s daughters – Shrijaya and Sujaya. While he has apologised to BJP workers over his remarks in Beed, Patil clarified that he spoke in Kannada recently as the native audience could grasp only that language.  The goof-ups are likely to hamper his political career, considered bright till a couple of months ago. A smear campaign has already been conducted within the BJP to curtail Patil’s phenomenal political growth. He was an office-bearer at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Kolhapur office till 2010, when the BJP inducted him full time and made him contest the legislative council election from the graduates’ constituency. Patil secured a comfortable victory but kept a low profile, following his Sangh ideals. His stature in the party started growing since Amit Shah became BJP's national president. Both of them share very good relations since Shah’s wife comes from Patil’s hometown Kolhapur. Patil has had close ties with Shah’s in-laws since his days in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in late '80s. He became number two in the Fadnavis Cabinet following the ouster of then revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who was the party's most senior face. On at least three occasions, when there were speculations over Fadnavis being replaced as the CM, Patil emerged as a frontrunner for the coveted post. First, it was the outcry of the Maratha community demanding reservation in education and government jobs. Later, the unprecedented agitation by farmers demanding a better price for their produce and, recently, the protests by Dalits following clashes at Bhima Koregaon on January 1 made Patil feel that he stood a chance to lead Maharashtra in the event Fadnavis is asked to step down for “mishandling” the crisis. It created the impression that Patil, a Maratha, could succeed Fadnavis, a Brahmin. The situation has rapidly changed and an impulsive Patil alone is responsible for that. He has become the target of detractors within the BJP. A source in the party claims that a whispering campaign has been engineered over Patil’s caste. Some have started circulating a message that says Patil is a Jain not a Maratha. It points out that there are many Jains in western Maharashtra, especially in Kolhapur and Sangli, who carry Marathi surnames like Patil. That Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, the founder of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, a major education trust in Sangli, was a Jain. The message asks what Chandrakant Patil has done for the welfare of Maratha students as the head of a committee constituted to deal with issues pertaining to the community, such as reservation and scholarships. If the message is an indication, it is the beginning of the decline of Patil’s influence.","date":"2018-01-23","tag":"BJP,Maharashtra,Chandrakant Patil","title":"Why Chandrakant Patil is facing the heat in Maharashtra BJP","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrakant-patil-kannada-belgaum-devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-bjp-rss/story/1/21920.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15308},{"author":"Subhash Kak","content":"There was an outcry in the Indian media last week when  , minister of state for human resource development, reportedly said: \"Darwin's theory (of evolution) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on earth, he has always been a man.\" He was speaking to reporters in Aurangabad at the All India Vaidik Sammelan. He reportedly added: \"Nobody - including our ancestors - has said they saw an ape turning into a man. No books we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had such a mention.\" Indian scientists are shocked that the minister should speak thus against the idea of evolution which is fundamental to biology and medicine. How can the HRD minister be so ill-informed about science? This is all the more puzzling since he was a senior police officer before entering politics. Was the minister merely trying to be nice to the traditionalists at the Vaidik Sammelan, and he has no strong views on the matter, and perhaps the HRD ministry is safe under his leadership? My own thinking is that he is genuinely misinformed because, in reality, the idea of evolution (more general than Darwinian Evolution) is basic to all Indian thought, which is something that he does not appear to know. The least he can do is to understand both modern evolution theory and Indian ideas on it and then see how the education system in India can help people know the history of Indian ideas as well as the foundations of modern science. The Sankhya is the Indian theory of evolution, which is supposed to apply both to the individual and the cosmos. In it, the basic entities are pure consciousness and materiality (nature). Nature has three constituent qualities (gunas) called sattva, rajas, and tamas, and as the balance between these three changes the universe evolves. Out of the interplay of the five basic elements arise other principles (tattva): five subtle elements, five action senses, five senses of perception, mind, egoity, and intellect. The evolutionary sequence goes through many levels. The tattvas help in the emergence of life out of inert matter. The gu?as are not to be taken as abstract principles alone. Indian thought believes that structure in nature is recursive, and the gu?as show up in various forms at different levels of expression. The texts imply that ingredients for the growth of life are available throughout the universe. Infinite number of universes are conceived, so each new one is created like a bubble in an ocean of bubbles. The tattvas are not discrete and their varying expression creates the diversity of life in and across leading different species. Each sensory and motor tattva is mapped into a corresponding organ. Indian thought conceives of 8.4 million species, which is an impressive number, considering modern authorities estimate the number of extant species to be 4.5-10 million. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger thought that the S?nkhyan tattvas were the most plausible model for the evolution of the sensory organs. A quote on evolution on earth from the thousand-year-old, encyclopedic Yoga Vasistha (YV): Indicating the presence of other animals while the giant asuras were on earth, YV suggests that man arose later. YV also speaks of minor ages of destruction on earth that correspond to the yugas. The Indians believed that all life can be divided into three classes (Chandogya Upanishad 6.3.1): \"In truth, beings have here three kinds of seeds, born from the egg, born alive, and born from the germ.\" Given that it is also affirmed that life on other planets exists and that there was a gradual rise of life on the earth, it would appear that this implied a belief in a panspermia theory. Why aren't Indian ideas on evolution known to educated Indians? We see that Satyapal Singh did not need to deny evolution just to be on the right side of the remembered Indian tradition. The question then is: Why are the minister and other Indians ill-informed about their own sciences? India is the only major nation where history of science is not integrated in the school and college curriculum. People pick up bits and pieces on it from a variety of sources, such as tangential references in religious texts, and other sources many of which are unreliable or plain wrong. Superstitions arise in the absence of right knowledge and sunlight dispels darkness. A course on history of Indian science in colleges and universities will go a long way in presenting Indian scientific ideas to the next generation, and help people distinguish scientific ideas from mythology and fiction. The history of Indian science is not a politically divisive issue as it is not teaching religion or ritual. Why can't the HRD ministry take leadership on this issue?","date":"2018-01-22","tag":"Chandogya Upanishad,Scientific thought,Human evolution,Satyapal Singh","title":"What Hindu tradition says about evolution","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/satyapal-singh-human-evolution-apes-scientific-thought-chandogya-upanishad/story/1/21888.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15309},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"The Supreme Court on Friday decided that the judgment given in the Mahmood Farooqui case by the Delhi High Court is a  . The top court, comprising a bench of justices SA Bobde and L Nageshwar Rao,   of the American scholar against the high court judgment which acquitted Farooqui of rape charges, on the first hearing itself. While acquitting Farooqui, the Delhi High Court had controversially said, \"Sometimes a feeble no, means yes.\" There was much hope pinned on the apex court when the matter reached its door. In a hearing that lasted about 20 minutes, some observations and questions raised by the Supreme Court bench were deeply troubling. Here is a short account of the hearing because I was present in the courtroom: It began with the bench pointing out how the two (Farooqui and the woman) weren't strangers to each other. Justice Bobde observed, \"She knows him [Farooqui] well enough to make a drink for him.\" The bench went on to question the lawyer, \"How many times did the complainant visit the house of Farooqui alone.\" The court referred to an earlier incident when the complainant and Farooqui kissed despite the presence of Farooqui's wife in the house. The bench mistakenly thought that the incident is of the same day, but advocate Vrinda Grover informed that the instance of kissing did not happen on the day of the incident. The bench went into a discussion on whether the complainant faked an orgasm which could have led Farooqui to believe that she gave her consent. The bench asked: \"So, how did she communicate that she didn't have the  ? The lawyer responded by saying that the complainant said no several times. The judge interjected by saying, \"Initially yes, but later there is a response wherein she says she faked (orgasm). People give fake smiles all the time. But how could the alleged accused know it was fake. She said she was afraid but what she did was completely contrary to someone who would be afraid.\" The court insisted Vrinda Grover read the email written by the complainant to the accused after the incident, which talks about how the complainant felt her sexual autonomy is violated, how Farooqui became forceful and how she \"went along\" because she was scared. The complainant also told Farooqui how his behaviour was inappropriate and went on to say, \"I love you and wish well for you but..\" The court picked on this line: \"Ms Grover in how many cases have you seen the victim saying I love you to the accused.\" The lawyer tried to explain how it happens in cases where parties have known each other and victims are still coming to terms with their trauma. The court dismissed the plea. There are two grounds on which the court primarily dismissed the appeal against the high court judgment. The first was whether the absence of consent was properly communicated to Mahmood Farooqui as the parties were known to each other and had a history of kissing each other. The apex court seems to believe that because the complainant faked an orgasm towards the end of the sexual activity, it gave the defendant a presumption of consent. This argument is flawed. First, if the complainant had repeatedly   when the sexual activity began then faking an orgasm at the end cannot be conclusive proof that she consented. Consent in law is understood as the ability and freedom to make choices. The victim says she feared for her safety hence she \"went along\". This issue was dealt with in case of Doyle (2010) by the Court of Appeal in UK. The court came to the conclusion that the fact that the victim \"just let him get on with it\" was held to be no consent as there was a fear of harm. In this case one can argue that the fear of harm was not immediate. Most common law countries follow this proposition. One can of course debate whether the threat of harm was immediate or imminent or whether the complainant was reasonable in holding such a belief. But the mere faking of an orgasm towards the end cannot be conclusive for Farooqui to reach the conclusion that she consented. Let's move to the aspect of the proximity or the relationship between the parties. Both knew each other and had exchanged kisses earlier. But the past sexual conduct cannot be at any stage adduced as evidence for consent unless it can be directly established that it impinges upon the right of fair trial for the defendant. The test for adducing the evidence of past sexual conduct is pretty high even under the Indian law. It cannot be brought forth in ordinary circumstances, at least the law doesn't say so. In such a scenario for the bench to make observations like \"she knew him well enough to make a drink for him\" or \"how many times she visited the house alone\" raise some disturbing questions. I wonder, whether the sexuality of a woman continues to be on trial. The bench did clarify that they were not implying that making a drink or visiting someone's house gives one the right to rape, but having such questions is in itself problematic in a deeply violent and patriarchal society. The language used in a rape trial is an important component in the entire process of delivery of justice. At no point did the court delve into the fact that the defendant was intoxicated. Was he capable of understanding the verbal and non-verbal cues of the complainant? Why wasn't the conduct of the defendant who was arguably in a position of trust not questioned at any point? Now to the second and more disturbing aspect, which is of the email sent on March 30, 2015, two days after the incident. It is true that the complainant does say that \"I love you…\" but here is the full text of that email:  (Source: Judgment of Delhi HC). Few days later, on April 12, 2015, the complainant writes another mail which literally abuses Farooqui for the trauma and pain and how the experience has been haunting her ever since. These mails should be understood in the proper context. This is an account of a woman who is still coming to terms with what has happened with her. As women, we often deny our realities unless they start haunting us. This is very well documented especially in cases where the victim and offender have known each other. The words \"I love you\" should not be misconstrued without proper context and understanding. This is not about a lawyer weighing her each and every words, imagining this to be used as evidence in court, but rather a woman who is finding it difficult to accept the reality in the wake of a saexual assault. Eventually it is for the courts to decide whether there was consent or not and yes the case of Farooqui is a difficult one. But the case has to be dismissed or admitted for the right reasons and in cases of sexual assault one can't ignore the language of it. The language is as important as the substance.","date":"2018-01-22","tag":"Consent,Mahmood Farooqui case,Supreme Court,Sexual assault","title":"How the courts failed in interpreting consent in Mahmood Farooqui rape case","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mahmood-farooqui-case-consent-sexual-assault-orgasm-supreme-court/story/1/21891.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15310},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for Davos to attend and address the  , the annual meeting in praise of global capital and globalisation, of reading the world as an interconnected place of interlocked economies and nations – seems poised at a cliffhanger. With the one-of-a-kind American president in Donald J Trump, whose protectionist   motto is exactly the opposite of what WEF has stood for, there’s bound to be “clashes”, if not among personalities, at least among competing ideas at the forum in the snow-clad Swiss Alps, despite the   on the mountains, thanks to India. With both Modi and Trump scheduled to give keynote addresses – Modi at the opening plenary session on   and Trump on the last day,   – it seems the organisers have tried their best to avoid awkwardness, and any hijacking of the forum by Trump with his anti-globalist ideas. While there have been protests against WEF by the anti-globalisation activists of the left, environmentalists, anti-capitalists from Europe and Latin America, the concern about Trump is unique, since it’s the US president this time, usually a force of globalisation and undeterred flow of global capital, who is spewing policies and ideas that are clearly in the “far-right” of the socioeconomic spectrum. On the other hand, despite immense criticism at home, Prime Minister Modi, who’s the first Indian PM to make an official trip to Davos after two decades since former   went in 1997, stands for pitching India as a global investment destination, even though it’s not going to be the easiest of tasks. With the investment-to-GDP ratio dipping at home, and the economic indicators that were paraded by the government, such as the   and the World Bank  , both having faced  , thereby stealing Modi’s thunder somewhat with hard data, the task has become more uphill. In fact, India is that rare big emerging economy that has seen its  , while the world economy as such showed a healthy upward swing, 10 years since the 2008 Wall Street crash. This has been attributed to the twin economic shocks – demonetisation and GST – and PM Modi will have a hard time explaining the counter-trend in India as opposed to the global upswing. This means at the World Economic Forum, which is hosting 2,500 delegates including several heads of states or elected premiers, along with 120 global CEOs, Modi and Trump would be doing the opposite jobs. While Modi will be looking for more FDI – it’s significant that 100 per cent   via automatic route has been sanctioned just before the WEF 2018 – and “hard-selling India” as a brilliant investment destination, Trump will be selling his America First policies to retain most of the CEOs who happen to be Americans, to pick the United States over emerging economies with huge markets such as India and China. With business heads, prime ministers and presidents of countries, academicians, philanthropists, environmentalists, Silicon Valley honchos, human rights activists and members from art and cinema all descending on Davos for the WEF, it’ll be the usual potpourri of intense debates around the biggest hot-button issues of our times.  These  narrow nationalisms (including the Trump variety, but also perhaps the Modi variety), climate change, cyber-security and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation in manufacturing that is posing a serious threat to low-end jobs, refugee crises such as plight of the Rohingyas, and the ongoing battles creating fresh flux of conflict migrants, ecological damage owing to urbanisation, depletion of forest covers for agriculture and industry, river and ocean water pollution, etc. On the sociopolitical side, the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and the #MeToo movement and the new feminist wave gripping the world, the demand for new equality, the women’s marches in the United States but also in other countries, the rights of LGBTQ peoples and their battles with law and social prejudice, especially in a country like India, sex education and reproductive rights for women, etc, would figure prominently in the debates. Released a week before the WEF commences, the   underlines all the major threats and the likelihood of their occurrence or intensification, that the global systems need to face together. These include extreme weather events, natural disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud/theft, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, climate/war-induced involuntary migration, terror attacks, illicit trade, asset bubbles in major economies, weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear arms race, biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, spread of contagious diseases, water crises, food shortage, among others. In fact, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum has clearly stated in the risk report that “unilateral nationalisms” pose a threat to the joint action needed to mitigate these enormous challenges, making a thinly veiled reference to Trump. While Europe is banking on French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bring more collaborative projects together, the presence of post-Brexit United Kingdom prime minister Theresa May, is likely to add to the clamour. Last year, in the aftermath of Trump’s election to the White House, WEF found an unlikely foothold in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ode to globalisation, underlining the great irony of a communist country head batting for the global capital and free market of funds and ideas. While Xi hogged the limelight and China filled in the huge vacuum left by the US in matters of international leadership, this time,   by Xi’s economic adviser Liu He, amid concerns over One Belt One Road initiative’s possible . This leaves a big opportunity for PM Modi to pitch India’s as the global destination for investments. As part of his Make in India scheme, PM Modi is likely to use the hoopla surrounding his Davos visit to signal that India is greenlighting major global companies to invest in India. His business dinner with corporate heads on January 22 and his   on   at the opening plenary session are both being looked forward to by Indian and foreign observers alike.    Though Union finance minister   the WEF, PM will be accompanied by a retinue of ministers, including Piyush Goyal, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan, MJ Akbar and Jitendra Singh at Davos, and Modi’s motto is going to be  .  In two recent interviews, a rare occurrence in themselves, PM Modi maintained that his stint at Davos would be about “sharing his vision for India’s future engagement with the international community”. PM Modi is likely to meet Swiss premier Alain Berset to discuss issues of financial transparency and black money. Being the face of the world’s seventh largest economy with an excellent growth rate that was stymied somewhat by the twin shocks of 2016 and 2017, PM Modi’s handling of the 2.3 trillion dollar economy has been keenly watched in the almost four years into his government’s tenure. While the Indian delegation of business leaders and members of the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry), including Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Chanda Kochar, Uday Kotak, Ajay Singh, Rahul Bajaj, among others, will be signing or negotiating pacts with their foreign counterparts, superstar and king of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan will receive the annual Crystal Award (along with Cate Blanchett and Elton John) for his work towards “improving the state of the world”. While Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, has confirmed that PM   with 60 top global CEOs, including 20 from India, on January 22 night, would be a big deal, literally, other informal interactions at the sidelines with representatives of General Motors, Sakesforce, Royal Dutch Shell, Nestle, JP Morgan, Airbus, Hitachi, BAE Systems, IBM, etc would be top calls on the part of the prime minister. The mix of soft power in the yoga classes, as well as the hard power through strong negotiations at the financial high table, would nevertheless be met with puzzling questions on India’s economic performance at home, as well as the case of Aadhaar which has now garnered  , despite fawning editorials earlier. This would naturally put a question mark of Modi’s other flagship scheme, Digital India, and would also sit well with the prognosis on data fraud and risk posed by digitisation encapsulated in the Global Risk Report 2018 by the WEF organisers themselves.","date":"2018-01-22","tag":"Foreign relations,Diplomacy,Climate change,Narendra Modi","title":"World Economic Forum 2018: Anti-globalist Trump and FDI-hungry Modi stand for clashing trends in Davos","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/world-economic-forum-2018-davos-donald-trump-narendra-modi-climate-change-diplomacy-foreign-relations/story/1/21889.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15311},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a hit in front of crowds — with millions of people watching him, waiting for him to speak, looking up to his podium with the adoration one reserves for deities. Yet, for all his charisma, it is hard to get a one-on-one with the PM. It is a rare occasion when one gets to see Narendra Modi answer questions posed by an individual in a closed room. So it was an “Eid ka Chaand” moment when Zee News’ Sudhir Chaudhary got the PM to give him an  . Even when faced with softball questions, PM Modi managed to give a few biting replies that will help bolster his supporters' affection and raise many an eyebrow — especially among his critics and detractors. Responding to a question on democracy and criticism, the PM  : “Criticism should not be seen as bad and this is the strength of democracy where everything must be analysed. Good things should be praised and shortcomings should be criticised.” About the criticism of the BJP government’s economic and financial decisions — including GST, demonetisation and the GDP growth rate slowdown — Modi said it is healthy since the country’s focus has shifted towards economy and growth. He added, however, that the BJP government has faced “less criticism and more allegations” and that issues like corruption and black money have long been a topic of discussion. He also  , “Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST. We brought economic reform, built toilets, brought electricity to 18,000 villages. The success of GST lies in the power of the federal structure. It takes time to adjust to change, but the outcome will be good.” But it was not just criticism the PM spoke about. On being asked about his unique diplomatic style — as he has demonstrated with world leaders like former US president Barack Obama, current US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Modi said he is an ordinary person and that is what helps other leaders befriend him. “Every time I stand besides world leaders like Putin or Trump, all I remember is that I am the representative of 125 crore Indians. They have given me the mandate to be there. We must also remember world is an interconnected entity and we cannot live in isolation.” Continuing on his interactions with world leaders and India’s position in the world, Modi said: “India has been instrumental in bringing world’s attention to financial transparency. It was acknowledged by former United States president Barack Obama.” Modi further stated that the Word Economic Forum (WEF) in  , Switzerland — to be held on January 22 and 23 — will be a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with the strength of demographic dividend: “Davos is a major platform in the financial world. Many business leaders gather there to deliberate upon the economic future of the world. India is the centre of attraction for the entire world. There are two reasons for that. First, our GDP is growing at a fast pace — and this has been accepted by leading agencies like the World Bank, Moody's etc; second, due to our strong democratic values. It's a unique combination of both in India. And that's what has evoked everyone's interest. So it's an opportunity for India to showcase itself on a global platform like WEF in Davos.\" Speaking of the Opposition, the PM said that the UPA government “did not address the issues of states. The central government did not listen to us. We respect the federal structure. Hence, we were forced to take economic and monetary reforms”. GST is the product of such a reform, he added. “We have worked hard towards building the concept of one nation-one tax.” Modi also spoke of a number of development issues, especially pertaining to the financial. “The country has witnessed a growth of 70 lakh accounts of employee’s provident fund. The Mudra Scheme launched by the Centre has also been successful. The initiative of government e-market has empowered small-scale entrepreneurs across the country. It has not only helped in reducing government’s expenditure but also dismantled the monopoly of big entrepreneurs.” Several times during the interview, referring to the gigantic mandate that got him elected, Modi said, “My work is to be the voice of 125 crore citizens and I am trying to do that honestly.”","date":"2018-01-19","tag":"Sudhir Chaudhary,Zee News,Interview,Narendra Modi","title":"'Don't judge me on demonetisation and GST': Modi talks tough on criticism in interview","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-interview-zee-news-gst-demonetisation-netanyahu-gdp-growth/story/1/21856.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15312},{"author":"Pooja Shali","content":"The news of the impending disqualification of   for allegedly holding office of profit spread like wildfire in newsrooms today (January 19) afternoon. According to AAP leaders, the matter to be referred to the president of India is without a complete hearing of the \"office of profit\" case. With that, the expected political blame game ensued throughout the day. Soon after coming to power in 2015, the AAP government had passed an amendment to the Delhi Members of Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1997 to \"exempt the post of parliamentary secretary from the definition of office of profit with retrospective effect\". The Kejriwal government later appointed 21 AAP legislators as parliamentary secretaries in order \"to assist ministers in speedy implementation of work\". The party even claimed that the 21 MLAs won't take any remuneration and so wouldn't fall under the office of profit regulations. It was the Congress, which on June 9, 2016 had moved the poll panel seeking disqualification of the 21 MLAs. Considering that one of them, Jarnail Singh, had resigned to contest the Punjab Assembly polls, the number stands at 20 now. The disqualification of the MLAs will pave way for by-elections in the Delhi Assembly. Sources claim 11 MLAs have been heard by the Election Commission and their statements recorded so far. The AAP, however, says these were not part of official hearing as the case was still in early stages of designating if EC, as a constitutional body, should hear the matter. Around 2pm today, reporters claimed their sources in the Election Commission (EC) hinted at a possible recommendation being sent to the president's office. It was also reported that the recommendation letter would agree that the MLAs received undue privileges as parliamentary secretaries, an additional position given to elected representatives (the appointments were against protocol). \r\n \r\n There, however, was no official announcement by the EC in this regard, neither a confirmation nor a denial. And this is what has precisely got the AAP's goat. The party leaders attacked the Election Commission for acting \"as an agent of the BJP\" and \"leaking information to the media\". \r\n \r\n The development signals considerable trouble for the AAP, which also heads the government in Delhi. AAP MLA Madan Lal rushed to the Delhi High Court in the hope of managing to get a stay order on the case. The court, instead, refused any interim relief and will hear the matter again on Monday at 4pm. The HC also reiterated to the party that the court has already deemed the positions unconstitutional last year and would not interfere further, asking the party to approach and respond to EC summons. \r\n \r\n \"If approved by the president, 20 of the 66 MLAs will be disqualified, with immediate effect. With 46 in tow (BJP-3,  SAD-1), they would still retain majority in the 70-member Assembly.   Interestingly, two MLAs within the AAP are anyway considered \"opposition\" - the vocal critic Kapil Mishra and Pankaj Pushkar, a supporter of Yogendra Yadav. So, the number would unofficially stand at 44 , for the AAP.  Delhi will have to then brace for by-polls to 20 empty seats. The situation, however, is purely hypothetical right now considering neither the EC nor the president's office has confirmed the \"movement of the file\". Sources maintain that the notice has been received and is under consideration. As reporters rushed to the AAP office by 3pm, party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj launched a scathing attack against the EC, making a personal remark about CEC AK Joti's age and his approaching retirement. “AK Joti was the principal secretary under [the then Gujarat chief minister] Narendra Modi and then the chief secretary of Gujarat. He is retiring on Monday. So you want to repay Modiji’s debt. You are mortgaging a constitutional post like the Election Commission,” Bhardwaj said. But the matter is at sub-judice, a fact that the AAP spokespersons were quick to remind. Party leaders, meanwhile, started to reach Arvind Kejriwal's Civil Lines residence and went into a huddle. Each AAP insider, I spoke to, expressed deep anger against the Union government, before the line either got cut or went on hold. The party leaders were oscillating between \"breaking news\" correspondents and chalking out a survival strategy. Since its inception, the AAP has accused most existing institutions of being corrupt and anti-people - media houses, political parties and bureaucracy had been declared as bought-off by the rich and the powerful. The party eventually realised that, once in power, the perpetual derogatory tone is not the best way forward. Interestingly, the Election Commission's credibility had also been questioned occasionally by the party, but today the AAP came out all guns blazing. But it's debatable if their arguments were justified since rather than focussing on facts, party members primarily targetted the chief Election Commisioner over his alleged proximity to the BJP. But it seems the AAP is not alone. Many others are also raising questions over the EC's move. \r\n \r\n Did the EC give any reasonable evidence in its defence against AAP's allegations that an independent organisation has compromised its credibility at the behest of a ruling party at the Centre? Well, an explanation by the EC will clear the air, before Arvind Kejriwal seizes the opportunity.","date":"2018-01-19","tag":"Election Commission,Delhi,AAP,Office of Profit","title":"AAP MLAs disqualification: How the 'office of profit' case unfolded","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-20-mlas-office-of-profit-election-commission-ak-joti-bjp-bypolls/story/1/21854.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15313},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"A fortnight after the riot at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on January 16 exhorted BJP workers to get into election mode in the next six months. That has led to speculation that the BJP might prepone Assembly election in Maharashtra by a year along with polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram. In his fourth year as the CM, Fadnavis' hopes to retain power are pinned on two \"achievements\" — his government’s social welfare schemes and the scattered opposition. While the first one has failed to convince the BJP cadre, the second situation might not last long, in the rapidly changing political scenario. Fadnavis has been insisting that BJP workers go out in public beating the drums on his government’s two goals, water conservation and debt-free farmers. The state’s flagship scheme, Jal Yukta Shivar, aimed at making 5,000 villages free of water scarcity every year, has delivered impressive results in some areas. The government has managed to deposit Rs 28,000 crore in the farmers’ bank accounts in an attempt to make them debt-free. However, neither the party workers nor its elected representatives are enthusiastic in advertising the government’s work. On the political front, the main opposition parties, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), are slowly but steadily working on their respective revival plans. The Congress has suddenly started feeling energetic after the Bombay High Court refused to prosecute its state president Ashok Chavan in the Adarsh society scam on technical grounds. Now, as he has no fear of action, Chavan is expected to come up with a broad strategy to corner the government. Confident that the government will not take any action against its two top leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the multi-crore irrigation scam, the NCP too has launched aggressive posturing against the government’s policies. A source told   that a fact-finding committee has not found any evidence of Tatkare’s involvement in the irrigation scam. On the contrary, the committee has pointed fingers at Pawar, whom the government does not want to touch due to several political compulsions. Caught in a tricky situation Fadnavis has only one option — boosting the morale of the BJP workers. He needs to pay attention to their grievances and demands and pat their back to make them feel they are also part of the government. His statement on poll preparedness is sparked by the sense of uneasiness he has noticed across the state. (Courtesy of  )","date":"2018-01-19","tag":"BJP.

Now, imagine what happens when the snow on these high mountains melts at a faster rate in view of the rising global temperature? From Jammu and Kashmir in the west, to Arunachal Pradesh in the east, India is blessed with an almost 2,500km-long Himalayan range with varying biodiversity in sync with altitudes. This includes Ladakh and parts of Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) that fall in the trans-Himalayan region. This is all part of the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region spanning eight countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (under Chinese occupation), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar — dependent on and facing similar problems due to the rising temperature in the HKH region. Ladakh has been witnessing increasing temperatures. Precipitation (snowfall in case of Ladakh) has been erratic to say the least. On the other hand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have been witnessing similar developments with springs going dry early each passing year. Mountain communities are dependent on the local springs for their daily water needs rather than the massive rivers gushing through deep gorges or meandering through valleys. What people on the ground and experts have been saying has been corroborated in a report that will soon be released. The changing climate is indeed a serious issue when it comes to the Himalayas, the repository of snow/glaciers that feed billions in the subcontinent. As part of the Paris Agreement, more than 190 countries have committed to reducing their green house emissions and taking various measures to ensure that the global temperature does not go beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (as compared to the pre-industrial time). But, even when the world manages to maintain the global temperature rise average at 1.5 degrees Celsius, there will be a rise of 2 degrees Celsius or more in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region by the end of the century, resulting in a substantial decrease in snowfall and melt rates increasing by at least 33 per cent. This is already happening as temperature increases more rapidly in the high-altitude region, points out a report being coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ), an inter-governmental organisation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (China), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The soon-to-be published report \"Comprehensive Assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) Region\", as part of the \"Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( )\" that is coordinated by the ICIMOD, points to a decrease in snow-covered areas and snow volumes over the coming decades in response to the increased temperatures and to the rise in the snowline elevation. The rising temperatures in the Ladakh region, made up of Leh and Kargil districts, should be a cause of immediate concern. Leh’s annual precipitation is about 100mm, all snow. Kargil receives more precipitation than Leh. For centuries, the region has received snow starting from October till March, vital for the survival of Ladakhi people and agriculture. Of this, snowfall in December, January and February is most important. But the scores of people whom I met last year and still others who I spoke with this year have been complaining about how snow has been missing for almost the whole of December in Leh town (about 11,000feet) and villages at a relatively lower altitude. A quick glimpse at the   (CRIS) of the Hydromet division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Leh shows that between 2012 and 2016, snowfall in November for four out of five years showed 100 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. For December, three out of five years show above 90 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. I called Sonam Lotus, who heads the IMD’s Jammu and Kashmir office, to understand what this data means. “Although just five years’ data is not sufficient to predict a trend, it is nevertheless true that snowfall in Ladakh has been variable and inconsistent. But one thing our records show is that there has been a significant increase in temperature (in Ladakh) especially after the 1980s,” he told me. Earlier, when there was snowfall, the snow would remain for almost a week or more. But now it melts in just two days, he observed, arguing that the increasing number of people (including the large number of tourists) and vehicles have pumped enthno-carbon and other green house gases into the atmosphere as Ladakh witnesses a drastic change, positive by conventional standards, in the standard of living. While talking about the future of the mountain communities and how their lives and livelihoods are integral to the well-being of the mountains, a common factor that comes forth across regions is the participation of the communities themselves. Unfortunately, government programmes largely neglect local communities. Be it the dams in the fragile Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, be it factories set up along the rivers in the Himalayan foothills or the mounting problem of municipal solid waste, the government wants to keep away the community and bring in an outsourced partner. For decades now, the effects of such a debilitating approach are for all to see. It simply has not worked because community participation is the key to conservation, the key to ensure that local and global interests are taken care of. One of the best examples is the World Wide Fund: India’s Western Arunachal Landscape programme, which began in 2010, has been monitoring the presence of and working for the conservation of threatened species along with the local Monpa population of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The community was faced with the crisis of springs drying faster — a continuous topic of discussion among the community and the WWF people. “Our conservation programme are primarily community conserved programmes, managed and owned by the local community. It is for their interest, to secure their livelihood and their ecological needs. For many years now, the community has been talking about the need for spring rejuvenation. We now plan to study and identify the springs in these two districts as a pilot project,” said Kamal Medhi, WWF-India coordinator, Western Arunachal Landscape. It is the tenacity of the communities that will help in the long run, with or without government help. But having committed to the United Nations via the Paris Agreement, governments of the HKH region countries are duty-bound to help their mountain communities. Going beyond the geo-political boundaries, these communities have had a healthy cultural exchange and a thriving trade. Even today, positive case studies from one mountain community can be tried by others and the government can facilitate such experiments. After all, for the government of India, as for other countries, there are very limited options when it comes to water availability. Surely, the Himalayas and their glaciers, the snow and the rivers that sustain such an enormous population are vital for our survival.","date":"2018-01-18","tag":"Himalayas,Climate change,Global warming","title":"Rise in temperatures is threatening the survival of Himalayas","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/global-warming-climate-change-himalayas-ladakh-arunachal-extreme-weather/story/1/21812.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15315},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"To immense applause from almost every quarter have the Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs)   between the newfound friends India and Israel, with great energy and enthusiasm from the respective prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu.

Involving a   cutting across sectors, such as cyberspace, energy, agricultural technology, Internet of Things and Internet of Energy, the big data deal has been pegged as “boosting measures... to revolutionise Indian farm production”. According to the Union ministry of external affairs website, the   signed between India’s Vijay Gokhale, MEA’s secretary of economic relations, and Israel’s Yuval Rotem, “envisages cooperation in the field of cyber security to develop, promote and expand cooperation in the field of HRD through various platforms and arrangements such as training programmes, skill development, and simulator based hands-on training. It also envisages collaborating in the field of cyber security resilience, promoting B2B cooperation in cyber security and facilitating industrial summits”.

Another related MoU has been signed between Invest India and Invest in Isarel – respective platforms – with the purpose of “supporting and developing cooperation between the two sides through exchange of information on investment opportunities, relevant laws and regulations, policies and government initiatives”. Keeping these three MoUs in mind, it’s important to look at another related news which claims that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is set to  , a “big data and smart city tech provider”, which is an important business delegate of visiting PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s official retinue. Reported by a number of websites, the then imminent deal was about RIL’s “move to get deep into the smart city, big data, defence and critical infrastructure space”. As reported by  , this deal is about RIL getting “access to next-level technology on a number of mission-critical monitoring systems, big data analytics software for power utilities, industrial internet of things (IoT), smart cities, critical infrastructure and defence sector”.   quotes an official part of the B2B event, saying: “mPrest places a specific focus on the IoE (Internet of Energy) sector. Its power utility offering is a ‘System of Systems’ platform with applications including DERMS (distributed energy resource management), asset health management, mobile asset management, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) enhancement and critical infrastructure protection security, and cyber management”. It’s important to read these two news items together to arrive at, if not a set of conclusions, certainly a set of pressing questions. Given the critical big data deal between Israel and India comes at a time when extremely sensitive matters of the very constitutionality of such mass-scale data scooping, collation and storage without the citizens’ informed consent, and/or any informed opinion on the technologically nebulous issues, are being heard in the top court of India, how are we to read this inter-governmental agreement, if not as an instance of technology-driven impatience of both governments and corporate behemoths? \r\n \r\n As reported in  , apparently, the data-driven methods are being shared and accessed to “fight cybercrimes”, and the request for access to big data was from the Israeli side in the context of “how technology can now be used to agglomerate vast amounts of information and then bear on individual field and individual farmer’s efforts, improve the yield”. It’s interesting that in a country in which the majority of “individual farmers” are either landless or with very small landing holdings, with virtually no access to digital tech or data thereof, even as they are being forced to obtain the biometrics-based Aadhaar card and then link it to other nodes of information/identity proofs, the peg on which the “big data deal” has been hung is agricultural technology via data analytics. In fact, Union minister of agriculture Radhamohan Singh “participated” in the delegation-level talks on agriculture collaboration using India’s population big database. Moreover, to questions of “safeguards in place to share Aadhaar-based data with Israel”, there were no clear answers, other than stating basis aspects of an agriculture-centric programme. While the digital push to augment agriculture might be commendable in theory, there have been reported instances of   a very tangible, essential, non-digital ingredient necessary for agriculture – the waters of Narmada River. Even as the Sardar Sarovar Dam has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with great fanfare, the   to “canals” and not farmlands, is becoming a huge bone of contention among the farmers of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Even Hardik Patel, the young Patidar leader who campaigned against BJP in Gujarat has tweeted his reaction to the agriculture-centric MoU between India and Israel based on the grievance on the ground. \r\n \r\n Given that the priorities of the government aren't exactly in perfect order when it comes to agriculture, with massive debt, rainfall lapses, crop failures and other endemic issues haunting tens of thousands of farmers, exactly how will a deal involving sharing of big data between governments and corporate behemoths - integrating the diverse investments in energy and telecom, while spreading its wings in emerging fields of data analytics and critical-monitoring systems - actually help the farmer in whose name the MoU has been signed? Which brings us to the next question: what about data security and privacy? What is the exact nature of the data that will be shared, and what all safeguards are being put into place? How is it that another country, Israel, is given access to India’s centralised databases, whose existence is under the scanner, and whose legality is being debated in the Supreme Court of India, as we speak? There have been a number of reports   by foreign agencies – whether foreign government-driven or private and commercial, but big enough to  , and the Aadhaar database –  as has been repeatedly proven –  is a  . In this context, it is important to ask if the inter-governmental MoU between India and Israel is at odds with the fundamental   of the individual farmer at whose behest the big data is being collected, shared with another country? All this at a time when a giant corporate entity from India, with extensive interests in oil and natural gas, telecom, etc is looking to not just   diverse fields, but also control the mechanisms of monitoring via   of Indians. As internet and privacy rights activists have asked, what does it mean to have “ ”? One of the fundamental premises is we must safeguard people, citizens, individuals, over innovations in technology that erode privacy, individuality, autonomy – informational and bodily. Aadhaar-based authentication and databases have proven to be structurally invasive and exclusionary, which means any technology based on, or dependent on, such a loophole-ridden system is problematic to the very core, at odds with India’s billion-plus citizens, who should not be treated as mere sources of data and be . In fact, Biju Janata Dal MP Tathagata Satpathy has argued on exactly this line, saying a line of argument that treats   should compensate citizens for sharing their data, not otherwise. Instead, if citizens are being harnessed and farmed for data, as it were, by governments, technology giants and corporate behemoths alike, then we have created a system that’s extremely problematic, to say the least.","date":"2018-01-18","tag":"Modi government,Benjamin Netanyahu,India-Israel","title":"India-Israel ‘big data’ deal leaves questions about security and privacy unanswered","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aadhaar-benjamin-netanyahu-modi-india-israel-big-data-deal-privacy-surveillance/story/1/21823.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15316},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"I am not a very religious person, though I was born a Hindu. I do celebrate the festivals and follow most of the rituals. My father was a follower of the Arya Samaj and we had \"havans\" on all auspicious occasions, a tradition I continue to this day. I was born in Pakistan and growing up in newly independent India, differences of religion, caste or ethnicity were not something I was aware of. We were taught to respect everyone, regardless of their roots. Some may call me deracinated, and I have to confess I still do not know my \"gotra\", but I believe the greatest quality of Hinduism is its liberalism and its plurality. It is those qualities that are under threat today, as who we pray to and how we pray becomes politicised. Where there is religion, can politics be far behind? This unholy alliance is ruining the world. Our democracy has been weakened by vote bank politics. The most obvious manifestation of this is the culture of appeasement of minorities practised by the Congress party in the 49 years it ruled the country since Independence. The aggressive assertion of Hinduism, otherwise termed as Hindutva, that we are witnessing today is a backlash to this. As the BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe writing in this issue says, “it has spurred a mindless competition to get the tag of minorities”. This is not the way forward if we are to build an equitable society. The disadvantaged should be helped regardless of caste, creed or religion. It will happen only if we stop mixing politics with religion and prevent extremists from radicalising faith. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s new book,  , puts upfront a critical issue of our time - the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva. While Hinduism has a distinct cultural ethos with a common history, common literature and common civilisation, Hindutva believes Indian nationalism is the same as Hindu nationalism, and that non-Hindus must acknowledge their Hindu parentage or convert to Hinduism to return to their true cultural roots. Hindutva maintains that Hindus need to preserve and protect their religion and culture against the onslaught of a hostile, alien world. It is insecurity that drives this sentiment rather than strength, which is what Swami Vivekananda, who can only be described as the first rock star of Hinduism, believed in. I believe Hinduism teaches us to live amidst a variety of other identities, and to do anything differently would be, as Tharoor notes, a partition of the soul, after the partition of the soil. In the best traditions of the religion, we have invited reputed scholars, ideologues and politicians to debate the issue. There is former BJP general secretary, KN Govindacharya, who believes Hindutva means Hinduness and not Hindu nationalism in the Western sense; former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi says the freedom of a Hindu to self-define his or her dharma is the greatest asset of Hinduism; novelist Kiran Nagarkar calls out the Sangh Parivar for obliterating the inherent inclusive values of Hinduism; while the bestselling author Devdutt Pattanaik exposes the myth of the wounded Hindu, tormented by a thousand years of slavery at the hands of the invaders. There is much more. Some of it is despondent, such as author and translator Arshia Sattar’s argument that the distinction between Hinduism as plural and Hindutva as singular is being lost at the hands of the newly empowered local gatekeepers of Hinduism and active proponents of a \"Hindu Rashtra\". For a multi-cultural country like India to be divided on the basis of religion is a recipe for disaster. But I remain hopeful. After all, which other religion in the world can say that it does not claim to be the only true one?

Pakistan Taliban’s claims are published in a  ,  , written by a senior Taliban leader Abu Mansoor Asim Mufti Noor Wali. The book was published on November 30, 2017, at Maseed Computer Centre at Barmal, in Afghanistan’s Paktika province. The 588-page book, posted online, contains TTP’s history, military operations, activities in Afghanistan, pictures of many Taliban leaders, and claims its involvement in a suicide bombing two months earlier at Bhutto’s procession in Karachi in October 2007, killing more than 140 people. The book claims that, “Despite attacks on Benazir Bhutto’s procession in Karachi, the government had not taken appropriate security measures that made it possible for the attackers to have easy access to Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi.” According to the book, Bhutto was killed since “her return was planned on the behest of the Americans as they had given her a plan against the ‘Mujahideen-e-Islam'. And slain Pakistan Taliban founder Baitullah Mehsud had received information of the plan”. For the first time, a terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the assassination which altered the political dynamics of Pakistan. Musharraf was accused of conspiring Bhutto’s assassination, murder trial remained controversial and Musharraf was declared fugitive. It is important to understand what compelled the TTP to make this announcement after 10 years. It would be useful to analyse some of the developments to be able to understand the unconventional move by the banned terrorist group. Pakistan's military launched a major offensive,  , in 2014 in North Waziristan and Khyber, following a major attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on June 8, 2014. The Operation was seen as a major success within Pakistan and the official records projected remarkable decrease in suicide attacks, terrorist attacks and fatalities in terrorist attacks. However, while the operation targeted a large number of TTP operatives, it did not manage to control the growth of extremism and terror within the country. There were major terror attacks in northwestern region conducted by Jaamat-ul-Ahrar (JA), a splinter group of TTP. The beginning of 2017 witnessed a series of terror attacks claimed by ISIS, challenging the success of the military’s counter-terror efforts. On February 22, 2017, Pakistan Army announced the launch of a nationwide military operation, Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. According to an ISPR release, “the efforts entail conduct of broad spectrum security/counter terrorism operations by Rangers in Punjab, continuation of ongoing operations across the country and focus on more effectives border security management. Country wide de-weaponisation and explosive control are additional cardinals of the effort\".  The operation came as a response to a series of at least six back-to-back attacks in Pakistan within a week (mid-February 2017), killing more than 100 people in different parts of Pakistan. One of the deadliest attacks in the string of terror attacks took place on February 16, when a suicide bomber blew himself up among the devotees in the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. The attack was claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) and resulted in about 88 deaths and 300 injured. On the same day, in Awaran, an IED attack on a military convoy took place. is a continuation of the \"National Action Plan\" which was formulated after the 2014 attack in Peshawar on Army Public School. Expectations with Radd-ul-Fasaad have been high and army has claimed positive results from the ongoing operation, but the fact remains, that military’s \"selective approach\" in targeting terrorists will never allow the counter-terror efforts to succeed. Pakistan's military has been extremely proud of its counter-terror operations as these efforts have assisted the military to regain its waning credibility and prestige after  . Pakistan did draw out some applause from the US administration for its efforts in April 2017. The US-Pakistan relationship has been strained over the past six years and took an unyielding shift with the announcement of President Donald Trump’s Afghan policy which carried a firm message for Pakistan. Trump excoriated Pakistan for harboring criminals and terrorists. The US   revealed in December 2017 also carries an equally harsh message for Islamabad. Pakistan denied the charges and has reacted strongly to the US stance, claiming that Islamabad has lost 50,000 civilians and 6,000 security personnel in the war on terror and Washington cannot ignore these sacrifices. Although the US-Pakistan relationship is at the lowest in the past 16 years, the fact remains that both nations need each others’ support for various compelling reasons. While the US will require Pakistan’s support till it wants to continue its presence in Afghanistan, Pakistan is reliant on the US given its influence in international organisations. Washington is pressurising Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and Pakistan cannot afford not to take US concerns and stance into consideration. There have also been reports of ISIS establishing its base in Pakistan and spreading its tentacles. The  published by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, alleges that ISIS is especially active in northern Sindh and Balochistan. Given these developments - Pakistan's military rejoicing over its victory over terrorists (mainly TTP as it is the deadliest anti-state organisation), US pressure on Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and the threat posed by the expansion of ISIS - one can infer what led to Pakistani Taliban’s revelation of Bhutto’s assassination. The revelation at this point of time serves three main purposes for the TTP: • It is a repeat signal to Pakistan's military that TTP would counter every move of US-Pakistan partnership in counter-terror operations. • In the past one year, terror attacks by ISIS have been on the rise which poses a threat to TTP’s status. The announcement also helps the organisation to reassert its presence. • Lastly and very importantly, it brings Pakistani Taliban in news and national and international limelight in an effort to maintain its positon and status in the competitive world of terrorism. While Pakistan's military claims that terror attacks are reducing in numbers, the TTP appears to be intact and determined in its resolve to oppose the state.","date":"2018-01-16","tag":"TTP,Musharraf,Pakistan,Benazir Bhutto","title":"Why Pakistan Taliban is claiming it killed Benazir Bhutto","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/benazir-bhutto-assassination-pakistan-musharraf-tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-baitullah-mehsud/story/1/21782.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15318},{"author":"Ashok K Singh","content":"VHP leader  ’s allegations about \"conspiracy to kill him to weaken the Hindutva forces\" sound as startling as the Congress’s overtures to him appear to be confounding. But pause for a moment to think and you will see that it’s neither startling nor confounding. The Togadia episode fits in well with the current politics of the BJP as well as the Congress. The international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been out in the cold for the past many years. He is of no use to BJP stalwarts Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in their home state. Togadia had no role to play in the Gujarat Assembly elections or its politics for a long time now. Modi has been winning the state elections on his own steam since 2001. In the early years, Togadia’s rabble-rousing, Muslim-baiting rhetoric helped mobilise VHP workers in Modi’s favour, but gradually Modi cut him to size.  Notwithstanding his nuisance value and hate speeches, Togadia, perhaps, was an asset for the BJP before and during the Vajpayee era. So were Ashok Singhal, assortment of sants and sadhus and many of Sangh Parivar motor mouths. But the Ayodhya issue gradually lost momentum after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Although it prepared the ground for the first BJP-led government at the Centre, the party realised it was running out of agendas to keep the Hindutva pot boiling. Until Modi strode across the Gujarat landscape as he became chief minister in 2001. Soon 2002 riots happened and Modi burst onto the national scene. After the riots, Modi had no need for Togadia and his ilk in Gujarat. He emerged at the head of the hardline Hindutva, as its most potent mascot. He was capable of packaging VHP, Bajrang Dal, LK Advani and Vajpayee in one heady mix that became brand Modi. He could do everything that Togadia was capable of, and much more, but in a subtler manner. By Modi's second term as chief minister, Togadia and VHP became virtually irrelevant in Gujarat. The VHP and Bajrang Dal lost traction. In 2007 Assembly elections, Modi forced Togadia to stay out of Gujarat. In 2012 elections, a desperate Togadia tried to stage a comeback. He threw his lot with rebel BJP leader and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, but results reaffirmed Modi’s invincibility. The people of Gujarat had bought into Modi's cocktail of development and Hindutva.  Despite Modi facing rough weather in the recent Assembly elections, Togadia remained a persona non grata for the BJP.  His mysterious disappearance for a day, hospitalisation and press conference alleging that he feared for his life in \"fake police encounter\" at the behest of the forces that wanted to weaken the Hindutva cause can be understood in the background of his strained relations with Modi. But the Congress seems to be placing values on even a weakened and irrelevant Togadia. In its desperate bid to reclaim lost power, the Congress under the president Rahul Gandhi is prepared to adopt all means, including supping with disgruntled Hindutva forces. Senior Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia met Togadia at the hospital in public glare. He said he met the VHP leader in his “personal capacity”, but expressed concern about \"dangers\" to Togadia’s life. Rahul Gandhi’s ally in Gujarat elections, Hardik Patel, too met him. \r\n \r\n While they hit out at Modi and the Gujarat dispensation and demanded inquiry into Togadia’s allegations, it was ironical that they didn’t speak about the former doctor who has been a symbol of hate and bigoted politics. The BJP has asked the Congress to clarify its stand on whether the party supports the VHP leader. Hardik Patel posted a flurry of tweets before and after meeting Togadia. \r\n \r\n The Congress’s hobnobbing with the VHP leader is part of Rahul Gandhi’s grand strategy to take the fight to the BJP camp. Emboldened by restricting the BJP to under-100 seats in Gujarat after his temple-hopping, declaring himself a Shiv-bhakht and janeudhari, Rahul Gandhi has made his intentions clear: a brick for a brick and an eye for an eye in the run up to the 2019 elections. Karnataka is bracing for a contest for Hindu votes between the Congress and the BJP. Later in the year, the contest is set to become even more ugly as the politics of grabbing majority votes gathers moment. One can understand Rahul Gandhi’s compulsion in wooing Hindus to regain votes the Congress has lost to the BJP. What’s difficult to stomach is that the Congress is willing to court someone like Togadia, perhaps the biggest hate monger the country has seen in the post-independence period. The central leadership of the Congress has not commented on Modhwadia’s meeting with Togadia, which speaks of its dilemma on taking a clear- cut stand. The Congress should have explained why Modhwadia met him and why didn’t he condemn Togadia’s politics while demanding investigations into the VHP leader’s allegations. The Congress’s occasional dalliance with the RSS has been known. Indira Gandhi’s temple visits and Rajiv Gandhi’s courting of soft-Hindutva for votes and its terrible consequences are also known. But never has the Congress dared to have truck with any bigot or Muslim baiter like Togadia or has even given the impression that it's ready to do politics with such elements. Or has the difference between “soft” and \"hardline\" Hindutva been completely blurred?  ","date":"2018-01-17","tag":"Narendra Modi,VHP,Pravin togadia,Congress","title":"Newfound love for Pravin Togadia unmasks Congress' Hindutva agenda","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pravin-togadia-congress-rahul-gandhi-hardik-patel-vhp-modi-amit-shah/story/1/21788.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15319},{"author":"Claude Arpi","content":"On New Year's Eve, President Xi Jinping   to extend his greetings to all Chinese and… friends all over the world. Xi said that Beijing is dedicated to safeguarding peace. \"China will act as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and an upholder of the international order.\" Will this translate in peace on the border in 2018? Probably not! Rumours are circulating that troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have intruded in Gelling sector in the Siang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh. China has not fully digested the fact that India stood up for Bhutan when the PLA was trying to build a road in June near the trijunction between Sikkim and Chumbi Valley in Tibet. Quoting \"experts\", a PLA website admitted that China will be better prepared \"next time\": \"the recent Doklam standoff had propelled China to perfect its strategy in its western part\" said chinamil.com.cn. Zhao Xiaozhuo, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences is quoted by the same newspaper: \"India never takes road construction as an opportunity… and only thinks about its own interest.\" Was the road on Bhutanese territory really an opportunity for India? It makes no sense. During a recent press conference, the spokesperson of the China's ministry of national defence said India \"should strictly control its troops\". While China is getting ready for another standoff, Beijing deeply dislikes Delhi developing its side of the border.  resented the recent visit of the Indian Union home minister  ; Singh spent the New Year with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). \"An Indian road construction project connecting all border posts along the China-India frontier could lead to new military standoffs between China and India,\" warned another Chinese expert. China is unhappy because Rajnath Singh asserted that \"a number of border posts had already been connected with roads and many would soon be linked… this would enhance the operational efficiency of the officers and reduce mountain-related sickness among them.\" While Beijing is going full steam to build infrastructure on its side of the McMahon Line, it complains about Delhi building roads on India's borders; amazing double standards. Nelong Border Outpost (BoP), located at the height of 11,700 feet, is manned by the ITBP. Accompanied by ITBP director general, RK Pachnanda, the minister later visited Pulam Sumda (14,200 feet) and interacted with jawans and officers. The area is disputed by the Chinese only because Beijing refuses to adhere to the universally-accepted principle of \"watershed\" used for demarcating borders. In Nelang, the watershed in the area is located at Tsangchok pass, beyond Pulam Sumda. At the same time, Beijing does whatever it wants on its side of the border.  recently reported: \"Investment in infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is helping to lift 628 villages along the border out of poverty.\" The Chinese newspaper further asserted: \"After getting access to electricity and the construction of new roads, tea farmers and herdsmen in a village some 200 kilometres southwest of Lhasa in Tsona county founded a cooperative that provides skills training and job opportunities for villagers.\" Lepo, a tiny village, north of Khenzimane, the last border post on the McMahon Line is said to have received several thousands of visitors last year and adequate lodging facilities have been provided to them. China further admitted: \"Starting last year, more than 100 million yuan (Rs 99.4 crore) has been invested in infrastructure in villages of less than 100 families as a part of a broader construction project to build model villages in the border area.\"  estimated that by 2020, the road access rate in the area will reach 100 per cent and the per capita disposable income will double. Last week, Xinhua reported that China's least populated township had been connected to the national grid. It is Yume (also spelt Yulmed), the first hamlet north of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh.Remember, at that time of the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping had written a letter to two young Tibetan herders who had introduced their village to the Chinese president. It was the same Yume.  commented: \"A sparsely populated township has been connected to the state electricity grid, ending life without electricity for its 32 residents.\" The contractor, a Xining-based electric power company who worked on the project is quoted saying: \"The 15-kilometer 10-kilovolt power line, which took five months to complete, is connected via 108 electric poles over a 5,000-meter-high mountain.\" There are many such examples along the Tibetan side of the McMahon Line.

He is the third chief minister in four and a half years. Bizenjo replaced Sanaullah Zehri of the PML (Nawaz), who was forced to resign from office ahead of a no-confidence motion against him. Not surprisingly, 11 of the 14 incoming cabinet members are members of the PML(N). Most observers see this manoeuvre as the Pakistan Army’s move to punish former PM Nawaz Sharif by depriving his party of any sustenance. If anything, this is a sign that parties and ideology don’t matter in official Baloch politics, but it is individuals who are easily open to manipulation. In fact, Bizenjo won the 2013 election with just 544 votes cast in his favour. The turnout in his constituency was just 1.18 per cent. In 2013, PML(N) won a majority of seats and formed a coalition government and selected a middle-class Baloch nationalist, Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party as chief minister. But Malik had to make way for Zehri in 2015. Baloch nationalists opposed the elections and many boycotted the process. Even those who did participate, such as Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the leader of the Balochistan National Party, rejected the outcome, charging authorities with manipulating the results. Balochistan has suffered from prolonged political turmoil and successive phases of insurgency and violent religious extremism. The most recent bout of violence began in 2003 and is still continuing. In the period between 2011 and 2016, nearly 4,000 people were killed, including 1,000 classed as terrorists, who could be separatists or sectarian killers who target Shias in the Quetta area. In 2017, violence intensified with massive bombings in Quetta, and other areas targeting Shias, Sufis and security forces. At the end of the year, a bomb blast killed nine and injured 57 people when a Methodist Church was targeted by the Islamic State. The Pakistan Army has sought to use violent religious extremist groups to counter Baloch nationalism and blame India for the violence. There are of course nationalist groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army, Baloch Republican Army and Baloch Liberation Front. Pakistani authorities focus their ire on Brahamdagh Bugti of the BRA as the principal villain because he is openly pro-Indian and has even sought political asylum in India. But actually, most Baloch nationalists reject secession in favour of greater autonomy and the groups are hopelessly divided along tribal lines. Balochistan has now come into international focus because of a report that the Chinese may be establishing a naval base on the Jiwani peninsula, adjoining the port they built and operate in Gwadar. Not many are taken in by Beijing’s denial. As for Gwadar, it is the starting point of CPEC, which has become a flagship scheme of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan claims Chinese investments will generate jobs and prosperity for everyone, including the Baloch. The government believes that once the mega projects kick in, Baloch nationalism will lose steam. There is an element of wishful thinking in the Pakistani belief that CPEC will be an answer to all its problems and moderate Baloch nationalism. They believe the Baloch live in a feudal environment, dominated by their sardars and once the area is opened up, things will change. Pakistani authorities have shown little sophistication in addressing the challenge of violence in the province whose roots go back to the sensitive issue of Baloch identity. The Pakistani state, especially the Army, tends to see Baloch nationalism as a threat to Pakistan’s integrity. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to introduce the “Indian hand” as the cause of problems. They cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s references in his Independence Day speech in 2016 and their capture of naval officer Kubhushan Jadhav to back their claims. However, Modi’s reference was innocuous to say the least and as for Jadhav, there is no real proof that he was involved in doing anything in Balochistan. Politics are not normal in Pakistan, and even less so Balochistan. Violence and political turbulence are, of course, there, but the real problem is that it is somehow not seen as being part of the Pakistani mainstream. By and large, its parties are electoral coalitions that rise and come apart depending on the exigencies of power. Sentiments are with Baloch nationalists, but authority is exercised by an elite which is backed by the Army.

It is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with experts calling it the most sophisticated ID programme in the world. Yet, recent events have proven that this mammoth exercise, which the present government has further pressed hard to make a standard requirement for availing the most commonplace of benefits and services, also faces the equally mammoth threat — data leakage. On January 3,   said its correspondent was given access to personal data, including names, addresses, postal codes, photos, phone numbers and emails of Aadhaar card holders for as little as  What’s more, with an additional Rs 300, illegal operators provided her a \"software\" that could facilitate printing of the Aadhaar card after entering the Aadhaar number of any individual. The initial response of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), which implements Aadhaar, was one of the proverbial \"shooting the messenger\", but following the cacophony the issue raised, it stepped into some positive action. UIDAI restricted access of around 5,000 designated officials to the Aadhaar portal. It also allowed citizens to use a virtual ID that could be shared with all agencies, including the government, rather than the 12-digit Aadhaar ID, lending it more privacy. The next question that is being asked is, has the decision to provide a virtual ID made the Aadhaar more complicated for the masses? How many of the citizens will actually use the virtual ID? Wouldn’t there be a large section which is still vulnerable? While the concept of providing every Indian a unique ID was hailed by all, it was the manner of it being made compulsory to avail services — right from the distribution of subsidies, to paying income tax to purchasing mobile SIM cards and insurance or even procuring a death certificate — that made it controversial. Giving out the ID for such services so rampantly also exposed it to misuse by fraudsters. The issue has reached the apex court, which is hearing a slew of petitions relating to privacy issues around Aadhaar, including whether privacy is a fundamental right. On October 30, the Supreme Court referred all Aadhaar related cases to a five-judge Constitution bench. The Court, on December 15, extended the deadline to link Aadhaar with insurance policies, mutual funds holding and mobile phones to March 31 this year. The next hearing is scheduled on January 17. This is not the first time that issues of Aadhaar data breach have been raised. In July last year, there have been reports that customer data of a telecom firm, comprising sensitive details of millions of its users, including their Aadhaar numbers, was leaked online. Even then, there was a demand from experts that India needs to strengthen its privacy laws in line with the 2012 recommendations of the Justice AP Shah-led group of experts on privacy. In its report, the panel had said that a framework on the right to privacy in India must include privacy-related concerns around data protection on the internet, appropriate protection from unauthorised interception, audio and video surveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy including DNA as well as physical privacy. In the absence of strict privacy laws, intimate details of citizens can easily fall into the hands of fraudsters, which need to be avoided at all costs. Even the staunchest of opponents to Aadhaar feel that the government is unlikely to back away from continuing to insist on Aadhaar ID for most benefits and services unless the top court comes out with some severe strictures. Certain countries, however, have backtracked on such initiatives after discovering flaws in it. Reports say the UK scrapped its biometric identification plan in 2010 and destroyed the associated database. Meanwhile, the Social Security Number in the US is not biometric and is not used for basic services such as phones and credit cards that can lead to mass surveillance and breach of privacy. Moreover, countries like Germany do not impose biometric identification to deliver public services. It can be argued that the situation in India is different, given the rampant leakages in the subsidy system, which calls for a more foolproof identification system.

Be it the launch of his political memoir (third book in the series) in October last year or his bold address at the Aligarh Muslim University on founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s 200th birthday, Mukherjee chooses his words and events carefully. The former president is all set to visit Bangladesh on January 14 on a three-day trip. Needless to emphasise, he enjoys enormous goodwill in the neighbouring country. Held in very high esteem from the days of Bangladesh’s struggle for liberation, his fan following , cutting across party lines, is simply huge. Incidentally, the native place of Mukherjee's parents-in-law is on the other side of the border, and he obviously has several close relatives living there. That apart, Pranab babu has earned this goodwill by sheer hard work and undivided attention to the well-being of Bangladesh in redressing issues pertaining to Indo-Bangladesh relations. His contribution can be called phenomenal in major contentious issues concerning India and Bangladesh. The veteran Congress leader held several ministerial portfolios in the government of India - external affairs, finance, defence etc. That notwithstanding, he never took his eyes off the happenings in Bangladesh and always used his good offices, in all seriousness, and on all occasions requiring effective intervention. Right from Bangladesh's independence war in 1971, Pranab babu has always been proactive and lending help whenever required - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return from imprisonment, his installation as the prime minister, the tragic assassination and the trail of sensational developments impinging on India’s geo-political landscape due to rise in power of pro-Pakistani, Right reactionary forces who usurped power by facilitating a military coup and exterminating Mujib. It’s is believed Mukherjee proved to be a sheet anchor to the bereaved family of Sheikh Mujib at the time of grief and stood as a great pillar of strength to them. He was also the bridge between the family members and former Indian PM Indira Gandhi, comprehending and reacting to the events unfolding in Dhaka . The bloody coup was followed by counter-coups that took a huge toll and pushed Bangladesh into a turbulent time. Successive regimes, imposition of martial law, general Hussain Mohammad Ershad's rise and Ziaur Rahman's assassination were hallmarks of Bangladesh contemporary history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The man who held the hand of the distressed nation and at the same time took into account India’s security interests, is none other than Mukherjee. Although Sheikh Hasina (in her earlier stint) eventually came to power and was voted out after five years, Pranab Mukherjee maintained good relations with all and helped solve age-old problems of water-sharing and the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs ) accord that facilitated the return thousands of Chakma refugees to Bangladesh. In brief, whenever Bangladesh ran into rough weather, Mukherjee steadied the ship and things remained on course keeping Indo-Bangla relations intact. Interestingly, opposition leaders in Bangladesh too have immense respect for Mukherjee and acknowledge his vision and hold over the nuances of Bangladeshi politics. Mukherjee will be in Bangladesh to attend a number of programmes, including the closing session of the \"International Bengali Literature Conference\". According to   news report, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina \"will inaugurate the three-day literature conference on Saturday (January 13) at Bangla Academy, while Mukherjee will be present at the closing ceremony of the conference on Monday (January 15), as the chief guest\". He will also be flown in to Chittagong on January 15 to be honoured with a D Litt degree by the Chittagong University. In Chittagong , Mukherjee is also expected to be accorded a civic reception. On his part, Mukherjee will present a cheque on behalf of the Indian high commissioner to the Preetilata Trust in furtherance of its activities . Significantly , Mukherjee will also visit the memorial of Surya Sen aka Masterda, the famous revolutionary, known for the Chittagong armoury case. In Dhaka, he is scheduled to deliver the convocation address at the East West University and the Nikhil Bongo Sahitya Sammelan. So far, no meetings have been fixed with any political leaders. It’s assessed that abundant caution is being exercised so as to keep Mukherjee away from any political event, lest it is wrongly interpreted since the general elections in Bangladesh are due at the end of 2018 or early next year. On the whole, the visit is likely to go a long way in reinforcing ties between India and Bangladesh ensuring that at least there is one immediate neighbour who can be relied upon and vice-versa. His presence on the Bangladeshi soil will also encourage secular and pro-liberation forces to rally around Sheikh Hasina, which in effect, will help neutralise communal and divisive forces.  ","date":"2018-01-13","tag":"Sheikh Hasina,India-Bangladesh ties,Bangladesh,Pranab Mukherjee","title":"Why Dhaka is gearing up to greet Pranab Mukherjee","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-bangladesh-visit-india-bangladesh-ties-sheikh-hasina/story/1/21725.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15323},{"author":"Nooreen Sarna","content":"When four of the   of the Supreme Court decide to hold a press conference to discuss internal disagreements, as they did on the morning of January 12, one   it was not an easy decision to make. One   that it was made under advisement and not carelessly or hurriedly. And one wonders how a schism of this magnitude can heal itself, without the independence of the institution being compromised, and in the absence of any rules or conventions to address factionalism in a collegium. The need for transparency in the functioning of the higher judiciary cannot be emphasised enough. The institution, while entirely unelected, wields a disproportionate amount of power. Constitutional amendments carrying the approval of Parliament and a majority of the state legislatures can turn to dust in the Supreme Court. Additionally, its members are (almost) uniquely difficult to remove from their posts; the process of impeachment being complicated, time-consuming and highly political. The   held at justice J Chelameswar’s house brought to the fore certain questions about the judiciary’s relationship with transparency in its functioning. First, why are there no internal safeguards to deal with administrative issues in the functioning of the Supreme Court? The fact that discussions among the five senior-most judges repeatedly failed, and that a press conference was held out of frustration rather than convention, highlights a lack of structure in the administrative functioning of the Supreme Court. It seems as though there are no intermediate steps to settle administrative or even disciplinary issues in our multi-tiered judiciary. In the higher judiciary, transfers on disciplinary grounds are not common and, naturally, at the Supreme Court, this is not an option. The remote threat of impeachment is the only way to correct or direct judicial conduct. However, impeaching proceedings cannot be instituted by other judges of the Supreme Court and can hardly be termed as remedial in nature.   For an institution considered to be self-governing and supreme, we find that, in situations of internal conflict, there is no structure for internal solutions, and recourse to the media and, possibly, political bodies becomes inevitable. Second, how do we trust that other decisions of this collegium have been made on objective grounds? The Supreme Court has 25 judges currently. Two appointments have already been made by this very collegium,  this past week, and more appointments may well follow here and for the High Courts. In the absence of a truly transparent appointment process, we cannot be certain that voting will not take place according to other prejudices and that the voting pattern won’t reflect other divisions. This is not to question the integrity of the four judges at the press conference (who constitute a majority of the collegium), but rather to say that dangerous conclusions are left to be drawn in the absence of public information available about the functioning of the collegium. And third, will we only see transparency in times of dissent? Is the judiciary picking and choosing when to be transparent? There must be transparency in administrative functioning of the Supreme Court, including in issues of allocation of matters to certain benches. This transparency should not be brought in only when there is a disagreement among the judges - it makes it akin to a kind of whistle-blowing, wholly dependent on the conscience and state of mind of the whistle-blower. This is not to say that there was no good reason to address the public about the deadlock in administrative functioning in the Supreme Court. For a body like the judiciary and the role it plays in our democracy, a show of transparency cannot and should not be sporadic. It should not open itself up to allegations of being motivated. Any efforts made at introducing transparency should be capable of serving as lasting precedents.","date":"2018-01-12","tag":"National Medical Council row,Dipak Misra,CJI,Supreme Court","title":"Supreme Court judges' revolt: Hard-hitting questions for Indian judiciary","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent/story/1/21713.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15324},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"A lot needs to be said about the historic day when four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court on January 12  of democracy - the media - to convey that the third pillar - the judiciary - is currently facing immense threat. The only time India faced such a crisis was during the Emergency. As the legal reporter for India Today TV, I have been asked by many people about what led to the day's events. How did things come to a head? And where will this lead to in the coming times? I will try and answer them in this piece: It's true that in the past few months, the judicial corridors have been abuzz about how power is increasingly being concentrated with the CJI court and the manner in which the administrative powers are exercised by the CJI. About hundred cases are listed before the CJI on any given day. Many judges have spoken about this in hushed tones, on how it is improper for the CJI to overturn the orders of the other benches because there is no intra court appeal in the Supreme Court. As someone who spends every day at the Supreme Court to report stories, I will admit, I have felt inhibited bringing to light some of these issues which need to be discussed in the open. The order of two-judge bench cannot be overturned by a three-judge bench unless the two-judge bench has referred the matter to a larger bench. These are some of the grievances which have been criticised. The issue of impropriety, however, is more serious: It is repeatedly pointed in the seven-page letter circulated by the judges on Friday that the way the CJI exercises his \"administrative powers\" is arbitrary. This phrase needs to be broken down and looked at. Administrative powers in the Supreme Court means how cases are allocated to benches. It's extremely crucial that the matters are allocated according to the roster and not haphazardly. The allegation made implies that the CJI is not following the rules and is allocating matters to a particular bench to get a predictable outcome. A crucial unsaid truth about the judiciary is that journalists and lawyers can always get a sense of the mood and inclination of judges. Political leanings of judges, if any, are also widely spoken of, off the record. These things can't be said on public fora. A social closeness to a political person does not necessarily mean that the judge is not being objective while handling a case. But it is very important for the fate of the case as to in front of which bench it is listed. It is a crucial aspect in the process of deliverance of justice. It is not merely administrative in nature. What led to the happenings of January 12 go back to events of November 10, 2017 when the seeds of the dissent were sown. It was the day when the CJI  of Justice Chelameswar to refer the MCI scam to the bench of top five judges. An ugly scene broke out in the Supreme Court, with Prashant Bhushan openly alleging that the CJI was involved in corruption. An angry Bhushan walked out of the court when he wasn't allowed to speak. An order was passed by the CJI bench reasserting that the Chief Justice of India is the master of the roster. Even to this day, sources say, justice Lokur and other judges of the Supreme Court met justice Chelameswar. Some statement was expected on that day too, however, the steam seemed to have fizzled out. A few days later, the plea was referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. He was given this matter despite the fact that he was part of the five-judge bench which overturned the order of justice Chelameswar. Justice Misra was   about the conduct of Prashant Bhushan. Some argued that the matter should have been referred to another bench in the spirit of fairness. As expected, justice Arun Mishra dismissed the plea of Prashant Bhushan and severely criticised his conduct. In a related petition, Rs 25 lakh was also imposed on Bhushan. The matter was settled then, but a hurricane began to brew. Then came the plea seeking investigation into the allegedly mysterious death of judge BH Loya, who was presiding over the CBI court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. The matter was again referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. One of the petitioners in the Loya case came to me and informed that a senior lawyer backed out from the case by saying nothing was going to happen in the matter. It was during this conversation at 11.10am that a source informed me of the press conference. Interestingly, while the press conference was taking place, the CJI court around 12 noon was informed of the developments. A whistle was sounded in the CJI court and the guards rushed in to escort the CJI out of the courtroom. The timing of this entire incident cannot be overlooked. The press conference took place during the working hours of the Supreme Court and the CJI had no clue about this development. The top four judges of the Supreme Court rose up at around 11am and headed to the residence of Justice Chelameswar. Many legal experts today sound surprised with the developments of the day. They seem to have missed the frustration and the discontent brewing in the power corridors of the judiciary. The push and pull of the collegium is not something new. But when top four judges of the Supreme Court see no recourse but to address the media, we are indeed in for troubled times. The disenchantment with the way top court is functioning is deep and pervasive. The underlying current is the interference of the executive with the judiciary. When top judges of the Supreme Court say that democracy is under threat, we must take it seriously. When media shy judges are compelled to address a mob of press and speak openly, imagine the discontent and the helplessness festering within. The day shall go down in history when a clarion call was made for change and accountability. How it impacts the CJI and Parliament, the people of the country have a right to know and want an accountable judiciary.","date":"2018-01-13","tag":"National Medical Council row,CJI,Supreme Court,Dipak Misra","title":"Why rebellion at Supreme Court was in the offing","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent-justice-loya-mci-scam/story/1/21716.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15325},{"author":"Shantanu Mukharji","content":"With the advent of the new year, a group of office-bearers believed to be representing more than a dozen gurdwaras in the Canadian province of  , have jointly decided to ban officials representing India, its diplomats and others from entering the premises of the Sikh temples. The decision was taken at Gurdwara Jot Parkash Sahib in Brampton on December 30. Significantly, the pro forma statement mentioned “pursuant to the trespass to the Property Act (1990), the management of the Gurdwara Sahib reserves the right to ban entry to officials of the Indian government including but not limited to Indian elected officials , Indian consular officials and members of organisations who seek to undermine the Sikh nation and Sikh institution ( )\". The statement further stated: “Keeping in mind the interference of Indian consular and Indian government officials in the lives of Canadian Sikhs, gurdwara management committees have jointly taken the decision to bar the entry of these officials and members from gurdwaras across Canada. The presence of these officials makes members of the Sikh community uncomfortable due to their agenda of undermining the autonomy of Sikh institutions and organisations. It is our obligation to ensure the safety of the 'Sangat'.\" However, the statement clarified that the ban will be only on those visiting gurdwaras in their official capacity, not if they come in personal capacity. Meanwhile, pro-separatist activists, including Sukhminder Singh Hansra, have welcomed the decision alleging that officials were directly infiltrating into the Sikh affairs in Canada. This development is very  and, unless remedial measures are not taken without further delay, may give boost to the Khalistani movement, already brewing in the West. Examining the statements issued by the Sikh entities, it's difficult to miss the disturbing trend. When they say that the presence of Indian government officials tend to undermine the autonomy of the Sikhs and make them uncomfortable, it’s difficult to assess as to which factors are responsible to make the Indian officials’ presence uncomfortable. This appears to give a clear signal to the government to keep off the Sikh affairs which are interpreted to be the exclusive privilege of the Sikh clerical organisations. Gurdwaras have been rendering great service not only to the Sikhs, but to the world at large and the Indian community in particular in foreign countries. So what went wrong? Is it a growing distance between Indian diplomatic missions and Sikh shrines? This gap must be bridged sooner than later. It’s possible that a certain segment of the alienated Sikhs are discontented as their names continue to figure in the \"blacklist\" of the consular wing for their alleged acts in Punjab thought to be anti-national. If such suspicions are true, it’s time to revisit the names afresh. In today’s world of global uncertainties, no group can be insulated from the national mainstream. A healing touch is perhaps called for. Any tough measure is likely to be met with equally tough reaction which may be counterproductive. Coincidentally, barely 14 days after the Canadian notifications, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast (SCCEC) and America Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (APGC) stated that 96 gurdwaras have decided to ban entry of Indian officials. The ban would also hold good to Nagar Kirtans or religious processions. American Sikh entities following suit to the Canadian decisions, make the situation a little more complex. And if such bans catch on to other parts of the world, then a major fire fighting exercise seems called for before it gets out of hand. This also calls for caution as the SCCEC and the AGPC combine is the largest umbrella organisation of the Sikhs in the US. It is further known that the decision has been reached with the support of US-based Sikh group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). In order to enforce their diktat, the Sikh bodies have also threatened to initiate legal proceedings against those Indian diplomats trying to breach the ban. On its part, any state, or in this case the government of India, cannot remain oblivious to the designs of the separatists to go on a propaganda offensive espousing their so-called cause. It has to come down heavily on the elements, now on a collision course, supporting the Khalistan movement. Having said this, it’s equally important to assuage the genuine grievances, if any, of those Sikhs who are provoked to resort to such a drastic course of action. It seems all Sikhs in Canada and in the US do not support the latest move to ban the entry of the Indian officials. If not for the active cooperation from the gurdwaras, it wouldn’t have been possible for the government of India to contain the Khalistani movement, at its peak in the 1990s. Both the gurdwaras and the high commissions/embassies had excellent relationships, churning out best possible results for the Sikhs and the Indian government representatives. The late Naresh Chandra, former US ambassador, appropriated best of collaboration with the gurdwara forces bringing in much-needed peace. There are multiple names in this regard who accomplished the task with dexterity and patience. Both the Canadian and US statements have a thrust in banning the consular officers. Probably that’s where it hurts most because it extends services to passport and visa services. If they are attended to on a case-to-case and genuine basis, more than half the problem is solved. Consular staff, therefore, perhaps needs to be more caring, sensitive and patient to assuage the disgruntlement. Presently, the Indian ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, is a Sikh and a seasoned diplomat. His officers manning the different consulates also carry huge experience and acumen. Similarly, India's high commissioner to Canada, Vikas Swarup, is most articulate and experienced in public and media dealings. They can walk the extra mile to prevail upon the Sikh bodies to rescind their orders in the larger interest of the country’s peace and sovereignty. Equally important is to pre-empt any probable evil design by the Pakistani forces, especially the ISI, unleashed to encourage the Khalistani forces. Frustrated by its self-aborted designs of Khalistani propaganda for the last so many years, Pakistani agencies may be attempting to stir yet another move to pinprick our security interests. Such a move must be averted for good, as time is running out.","date":"2018-01-12","tag":"India,Khalistani movement,US,Canada","title":"Why gurdwaras in Canada and US banned the entry of Indian officials","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sikh-gurdwaras-canada-ontario-ban-indian-officials-khalistani-movement-pakistan/story/1/21705.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15326},{"author":"Mohammad Behzad Fatmi","content":"Under the ongoing state of emergency, Turkey has issued yet another controversial   on December 24, 2017, granting immunity to civilians who were part of the mobs which suppressed the 2016 failed coup attempt against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Authorities say such a measure was necessary to protect those civilians who risked their lives to shield their elected government - on the night of July 15 and the early hours of July 16, 2016 - from putschists. But the decree is so vaguely worded that it is possible for one to interpret it as granting immunity from prosecution for actions that one may have taken post-July 15 or may take in the future against a government critic on the pretext of suppressing the continuation of events on the night of the coup.  Regardless of its gravity and profound detrimental effect on the rule of law in the country, such a step by the AKP government hardly took anyone by surprise. Over the past couple of years, there have been multiple   of the AKP government establishing private militias loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. One of the such prominent groups is   which allegedly had dozens of its men armed with semi-automatic rifles on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, assaulting and killing many of the renegade soldiers on the night of July 15, 2016. Interestingly, SADAT also stands accused of killing a number of innocent civilians on that fateful night in order to boost public anger and help the government create a victim narrative. The newly issued decree practically means that not only SADAT and a number of other shadowy outfits like it will not be punished for these crimes, but they will also not be brought to justice should they take law in their own hands in the future, in circumstances they argue were similar to that of July 15, 2016. This move has led many to believe that the government is preparing for an imminent clash between President Erdogan’s Islamist and Dogu Perincek’s ultranationalist camp who despite being contemptuous of each other formed an alliance in the aftermath of the coup attempt to purge state institutions of pro-western officials. Dogu Perincek was jailed in 2008 during the Ergenekon trials for plotting to overthrow the AKP government, but his conviction was   in 2014 when Erdogan started to target the Movement of Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. On stepping out of the prison complex he talked to the media waiting for him and   that he will dismantle the “regime of Tayyip Erdogans, Abdullah Guls, Fethullah Gulens”, referring to the perceived alliance between the AKP and the US-based cleric. Since then Perincek has been back in business growing the influence of his tiny far-left Patriotic Party on important state institutions, especially on the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK). The “Perincek group”, as the ultranationalist pro-Russian companions of Dogu Perincek are often referred to in the Turkish policy chattering circle, has been the biggest   of the massive purge of pro-Western officials from the TSK following the coup attempt in 2016. The meteoric growth in influence of an ultranationalist group which has always despised the Islamist-rooted AKP poses an existential threat to the Erdogan regime - and Erdogan knows it very well. On the other hand, many analysts see this move as Erdogan’s preparation for another “false flag operation” which will justify crackdown on the remaining few voices of dissent in the country - the way the July 15 events justified suppression of the Gulen Movement. Even though there is no effective opposition in the country, there are still pockets of resistance and/or potential rivals which Erdogan would like to neutralise. The likes of former president Abdullah Gul, a few defiant MPs from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), and of course the Perincek group are certainly not the type of forces Erdogan wants to accommodate in his vision of a totalitarian regime in Turkey. Regardless of whether Erdogan had the former or the later motive in his mind while drafting this decree, the situation that it may lead to cannot be peace and order - which Turkey needs desperately. It will certainly push the country towards chaos and instability, perhaps even towards a civil war.  ","date":"2018-01-11","tag":"Civil War,Racep Tayyip Erdogan,Coup Attempt,Turkey","title":"Is Turkey heading towards a civil war?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/turkey-controversial-decree-coup-attempt-racep-tayyip-erdogan-civil-war/story/1/21677.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15327},{"author":"Majid Hyderi","content":"There is still hope, but only for some. In the past six months, two verdicts from the apex court on two separate pleas seeking fresh probe - into the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and the killings of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s and early 2000s - have drawn massive comparisons. On January 10, the   decided to set up a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to look into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases in 1984, investigations into which were closed earlier. The apex court has also asked the Centre to suggest names for the proposed three-member panel, which will be headed by a former high court judge. The 1984 riots, which broke out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had claimed the lives of an estimated 8,000 people in Delhi and around the country. But then, if riots dating back to 1980s can be reinvestigated through an SIT, why is it declared “too late” for fresh investigations into the killings of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s? In July 2017, the apex court rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking fresh probe into the killing of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir. Dismissing the PIL filed by an NGO “Roots in Kashmir”, the apex court said it would be difficult to probe as evidence “is unlikely to be available”. \"Almost 27 years have gone by… Where will the evidence will come from? Such a plea should have been moved long time ago,\" the   had observed. The petitioners had moved the court saying that they need a \"sense of justice\" in the case. \"The community has legitimate expectations. The successive governments have repeatedly made fake promises that the Pandits could return (to homeland). No one is protecting them,\" they prayed. The dismissal of the case buried all hopes for justice for the survivors of the systematic bloodbath. Apart from the outraged Pandit community, even a human rights group - largely run by Kashmiri Muslims - had sharply reacted to the court decision. The Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society in a statement had  : \"The Supreme Court order is a complete departure from established law that ‘crime never dies’, and there exists no time limitation for justice under Indian and international law with regard to serious crimes such as murder.\" The rights group observed that “killings of Kashmiri Pandits, other minorities and all violence in Jammu and Kashmir have never been fairly and credibly investigated”, adding, “Thus far, Jammu and Kashmir has faced widespread, systemic violence, largely at the hands of the Indian state.” Three decades on, the killings of Pandits, continue to be an unsolved mystery. For the all-resourceful government, it took around two decades to just consolidate contradictory figures of the killings. As per a first comprehensive report compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 2008, from 1989 onwards, 209 Kashmiri Pandits were killed. As many as 109 killed in 1990 alone. According to this   in , while 140 cases were registered at police stations across Kashmir, chargesheets had been filed in only 24 cases. In 115 cases, the perpetrators are yet to be identified. Even the first reported killing of a Kashmiri Pandit remains unsolved. According to the police, the first Pandit to be killed was a woman named Prabhavati from Budgam. She was killed in Srinagar on March 14, 1989, by unidentified gunmen, whose identity could never be established. Of all the districts of Kashmir province, the summer capital of Srinagar, as per the police records, had witnessed the largest number of killings  - 82 - within two years of the onset of the armed insurgency. Apart from individual target killings, in some instances, the minority community people were massacred. These include the Sangrampora massacre in which seven persons were killed during on the night of March 21-22 in 1997 in Budgam, 23 were killed in Wandhama on January 25, 1998 and 24  murdered in Nadimarg on March 24, 2003. According to the police, the perpetrators of the Wandhama massacre remain untraced. There are slight contradictions even in the official figures pertaining to the killings. In March 2010, the then government told the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that 219 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed by militants since 1989, , and not 209,  as previously reported by the police. But a year later in 2011, the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a Srinagar-based organisation, said at least 399 Pandits had been killed. There cannot be a bigger pain than the exodus of the bereaved community out of their homeland. And this wound has been festering in the absence of a fair probe, something which could clear the air and lead to the severest punishment for the perpetrators. It could equally contribute in reconciliatory efforts aimed at harmonious return of the Pandits to their homeland. If investigations into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases were closed without investigation, probe into killings of Pandits never took off. For the Sikh community, it has been an unfortunate case of justice delayed (even as the latest Supreme Court decision revived fresh hopes), but for the Pandits,  it remains yet another grievous instance of justice denied.","date":"2018-01-11","tag":"Justice,Supreme Court,Kashmiri Pandits,1984 anti-Sikh riots","title":"If 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms can be reopened, why not Kashmiri Pandit killings?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sit-probe-kashmiri-pandits-exodus-supreme-court-justice-delayed-denied/story/1/21666.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15328},{"author":"Hriday Ranjan","content":"Every time an actor announces the decision to join politics, my curiosity is piqued. We are a nation that worships stars. But when it comes to elections, we show them the ballot finger. Since the ‘50s, film stars in India have, without hesitation, hopped on to the next, logical platform: politics. According to a   entry, India has three times the number of actor-politicians than most countries, followed only by USA and Philippines (I wonder what’s happening there!). Election results for actors have been far from blockbusting. Indian film stars have realised the bitter truth that winning votes is a lot tougher than bashing up villains. In fact, Sunil Dutt might be the only major film star who had a long, successful political career — winning five terms and also serving as Union minister for youth affairs and sports in the UPA government. Govinda did nothing of remote importance as a politician; the highlight of his political career being the moment when he begged Sonia Gandhi to become the prime minister — much like the climax of a certain David Dhawan-Kader Khan film. Hema Malini’s political career has been as spectacular as her daughter Esha Deol’s film career — with reports of villagers protesting outside her office since they saw zero development under the Dream Girl’s leadership. Hemaji is now seen as a representative for Kent RO. Actress Jayaprada’s career started with the Telugu Desam Party in undivided Andhra Pradesh; she then switched to Samajwadi Party in UP, and finally launched her own party. Chiranjeevi, the Telugu megastar, too, started his own party in 2008. In 2011, in a move that would give Chanakya a stroke, he merged it with the Congress. And then there’s the murky history  Amitabh Bachchan and late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors scam. It is not only film actors who have dipped their fingers in the hot oil of politics. TV actors, too, have tried their luck. Smriti Irani is a success story, but other TV actors have found less success. Actors who essayed the roles of Ram, Krishna, Draupadi and Ravan (!) in mythological shows have contested elections in India. Shekhar Suman joined the Congress, lost an election, and returned to TV. Rakhi Sawant launched her own party targeted at the ordinary citizen, called Rashtriya Aam Party. So absurd is the association of stars with politics that Salman Khan has campaigned for both BJP and Congress. Bhai has gone so far as to campaign for the Sri Lankan president. Why?  Many actors such as Amitabh Bachhan and Govinda have gracefully resigned from politics, whereas the other have faced defeat, or been invited as Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. Barring Kerala, every Indian state has had actors chancing their luck in politics. Overall, the success rate of film stars in politics has been — to put it accurately — like Fardeen Khan’s career. However, this is only true in the northern parts of India. Down South, film stars have had blockbuster careers as politicians. People from north India are often baffled at the sycophancy surrounding film stars in Tamil Nadu, and attribute it to emotional overtures. It could be driven by emotion – like the temples built for actresses Khushboo and Namitha suggest. But politics is deeply intertwined with cinema in Tamil Nadu. The three largest political icons in Tamil Nadu are film stars — MG Ramachandran (actor), Karunanidhi (screenwriter) and Jayalalitha (actor). In undivided Andhra Pradesh, then megastar NT Rama Rao founded the Telugu Desam Party and became the chief minister of the state. In December 2017, Rajinikanth announced that he will contest the next Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In many ways, Tamil Nadu politics is starkly different from politics in any other part of the country. Thalaiva’s decision to bring about “spiritual politics” might have raised eyebrows in any other part of the country, but in Tamil Nadu, nobody batted an eyelid. The contribution of film stars to Tamil consciousness is rooted in the philosophies of Periyar and the self-respect movement. The state has a high Human Development Index (HDI) score when it comes to parametres like primary education and healthcare. In a nation that is slanting dangerously close to religion year after year, Tamil Nadu’s Dravidian politics has washed its hands of religion and caste. In fact, Tamil Nadu’s leaders are proud and fierce atheists — from Karunanidhi to Kamal Haasan. Thalaiva has his work cut out. Like in the film   Thalaiva is entering an arena with two established players — the AIADMK and the DMK;  Yet, Rajinikanth is not your average film star getting into politics. He is said to have 55,000 fan clubs in the state, besides a diasporic network of fans. There are legendary stories of his humility, and his unique tradition of returning distributors’ money for films that tank at the box office. In a state that has largely fulfilled its basic needs, Rajinikanth needs to deliver something else this time: faith. But as Thalaiva himself says in   “Once I take up a job, I don’t leave it without completing it... and I don’t take up a job that I can't complete.” Rajini can.","date":"2018-01-11","tag":"Tamil Nadu Assembly,Tamil Nadu,Rajinikanth","title":"Why Rajinikanth joining politics is perfect","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-tamil-nadu-politics-lok-sabha-polls-2019/story/1/21673.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15329},{"author":"Harmeet Shah Singh","content":"Uncovering secrets in an ecosystem as complex as India's is replete with monumental challenges. One came out last week when   newspaper reported that personal details of citizens could be bought for as little as Rs 500 via WhatsApp. Rachna Khaira, the journalist who broke the story, explained how unknown agents were able to provide access to names, addresses, photos and email aliases from what is advertised as Aadhaar's impregnable database. Her report compounded concerns over the security of the citizens' privileged details at a time when risks of identity fraud have mounted the world over. For cyber criminals, personal information is a gateway to potential scams. Khaira's report was expected to stimulate the UIDAI to generate an environment of confidence and safety when   has been declared a fundamental right. It didn't, unfortunately. Instead, the UIDAI went on a power trip. It filed a police complaint against the reporter and her newspaper among others. Its action rhymed with what is now a pervasive trend to spin unpalatable news reports, no matter how vital they might be to public interest. Investigative journalism is a great public service. As an editor of India Today TV's Special Investigation Team, I can say with conviction that investigative reports stand tall when political stories dominate regular television rundowns and fake news floats freely on social media. This form of journalism is centred on firm impact and not around TV ratings or digital hits. It sets a stellar example of agenda-setting reporting. India Today's enterprising SIT cadre has itself revealed massive scandals, underground economy, organised gangs, education scams, child labour, medical frauds, terror financing and a lot more over the past one year. These journalists have mostly gone undercover to their subjects — and caught them confessing to wrongdoings on hidden cameras. Had it not been for the SIT's exposé of a widespread   in Bihar, India simply wouldn't know about the scale of malpractices inside the state's educational institutions. Its startling reporting on the business of toxic hospital waste brought to light some of the worst forms of environmental and child labour. Our SIT busted black-money mafias across a variety of sectors in the wake of demonetisation. And when this Special Investigation Team broke a mega-exclusive on the Pakistani funding of the Hurriyat in Jammu and Kashmir last year, multiple government agencies swung into action in multiple states. The story set national news agenda for weeks that followed. What drives these courageous investigations is a mission to serve the people's right to information. But now imagine a situation when an investigative reporter is intimidated by the threat of trial for impersonation and cheating. It would suffocate the entire genre of investigative journalism. Remember, undercover reporting is a technique investigative journalists adopt widely across the world in order to get access that would otherwise be declined. They would pose as businesspersons, sport agents, financiers, patients, middlemen and so forth with a sole goal to get the information out for the larger public interest. But what has happened over the first weekend of 2018 is a vicious kick in the teeth of investigative journalism itself. In the world's largest democracy, journalist Rachna Khaira is charged under the IPC's sections related to impersonation, cheating and forgery for exposing glaring holes in the UIDAI's privacy-protection armour. Instead of putting its house in order, the UIDAI has tried to shoot the messenger down. But it's not all doom and gloom. For now, India's media fraternity has stood united against this spiteful tactic to suppress stories that hold power to account. But let's not stop here. Let this campaign be sustained in order to preserve, nourish and protect investigative journalism — that insatiable quest for the realities of power in the face of powerful opposition.","date":"2018-01-09","tag":"Aadhaar,Aadhaar data breach,UIDAI","title":"Why UIDAI's FIR against The Tribune journalist is a kick in the teeth of investigative journalism","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uidai-fir-aadhaar-data-breach-mass-surveillance-investigative-journalism/story/1/21632.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15330},{"author":"Javed Anwer","content":"Aadhaar didn't start as surveillance technology. While the concept of a unique ID for all was fuzzy even in the beginning — around 2009 — it was meant to be an authentication technology that would plug leaks in India's welfare schemes. The idea behind Aadhaar seemed well-meaning, but the way it was designed and hurriedly pushed made it evident to keen observers that it was not going to end up well. There were many problems with it, but of particular note was the way Aadhaar would give the government and bureaucrats unnecessary power over individual citizens. Instead of being a tool of inclusion, Aadhaar would be a tool of exclusion. Even in the early stages, it was difficult to imagine that one day the Aadhaar would turn into Frankenstein's monster. In 2018, it has become a tool that has the potential to put every citizen in this country under surveillance. The argument that Aadhaar is a tool to end corruption in India surfaced earlier this decade. After 2012, and exceedingly after 2014, Aadhaar grew in ways it was not meant to when it was conceived. This has happened as the UIDAI — the agency in charge of the Aadhaar programme — acquired unaccountable power over the people of India, and made its operations as secretive and opaque as it can. Fun fact 1: Do you know that under Aadhaar Act 2016, the UIDAI has virtually no accountability, but has provisions that stop Aadhaar users, that is ordinary Indians, from filing any complaint against it in court for the misuse of the UID? Fun fact 2: Do you know Aadhaar was never meant to be an ID card? In the initial days, Aadhaar was linked to government's welfare schemes. For instance, it was made mandatory for issuing ration to all those who held a ration card. This despite the fact that the Supreme Court, in its interim order, told the government that having the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory in any way. Post-2015, all hell broke loose. By now, Aadhaar is no longer just technology to authenticate the identity of those entitled to benefits under government welfare schemes. It transformed into an authentication technology for almost everything Indians do. In 2018, if you go by the directives issued by the government, you have to link your Aadhaar to almost everything you own or do. Aadhaar is no longer required only for welfare schemes, like obtaining a ration card, but also if you want to continue using your phone. It is “required”, although not yet mandatory, for availing banking services until March 31 because Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to it. Aadhaar is required for registering births in many parts of India, and even deaths. Aadhaar is required if you want an LPG connection, even if you don't intend to take subsidies. And Aadhaar is required if you want to send your children to school or if you want your degree, and for treatment at many hospitals — even if you are an accident victim and are brought to the emergency with severe head trauma! This is just the beginning. If the Supreme Court dismisses the current challenge to link Aadhaar with every aspect of our lives, be ready to see more Aadhaar in your life. Even simple tasks like buying airline tickets or making hotel reservations or renting homes will soon necessitate Aadhaar authentication. It is important to understand why Aadhaar has become so pervasive. By linking the UID with children’s admissions in private schools, or by linking it with private data, such as your phone number, the government is not saving any money. It is not curbing or cracking down on corruption. It is just putting in place an infrastructure: arguably the world's biggest surveillance apparatus that a country has built to keep an eye on its citizens. Sure, the United States’ NSA will still be bigger, but then NSA for now watches only non-Americans. In the recent years, Aadhaar has metamorphosed into the perfect surveillance tool. It allows the government to collect and record every piece of data that Indians generate as they go about their lives. By storing this data in one place, with Aadhaar as its key, the government will be able to theoretically track and build profiles of every Indian with the UID. There is the argument that we already leave a digital trail whenever we use a phone, carry out a banking transaction, book an air or train ticket or get an LPG connection, and so it doesn't matter that Aadhaar is linked with the service. That is true. But by linking every detail of our existence with Aadhaar, the government puts all of this data in one place and makes it incredibly easy to monitor, record and use. Across the world, governments seek to gain more control over citizens. When they have achieved some level of control, they also abuse it, as history tells us. Even if the original intent is benign, never in the history has a government built surveillance apparatus and not abused it. If we allow Aadhaar to grow unchecked, controlled and managed by an agency with no accountability — and it is the UIDAI that filed an FIR to go after people who pointed out Aadhaar flaws — the results are not going to be pretty.

The Gayoom government would be sending its foreign minister Mohamed Asim and defence minister Adam Shareef to India later this month. The proposed dates of Asim and Shareef's visit are January 11 and January 16, respectively. The two visits would be important events for the India-Maldives bilateral relations and a major diplomatic bid by the Gayoom government to build bridges with India after a series of unsavoury episodes. Currently, the India-Maldives relations are frigid on account of a host of incidents in the recent past such as Maldives signing its first-ever Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China despite its avowed \"India-first\" policy, the Maldivian media owing allegiance to President Gayoom severely criticising India in general and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, and restricting Indian envoy Akhilesh Mishra's movements in Maldives. President Gayoom is dispatching his foreign and defence ministers to India in a last-ditch effort to mollify India, greatly hurt by a series of provocations from Maldives, some of which have been mentioned above. Though these ministers would obviously be meeting their Indian counterparts, Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman, their main agenda would be to meet the big man himself, PM Modi. The course the relationship between the two countries takes would all depend on whether Modi is willing to meet the two senior Maldivian ministers. If he does so, it would be construed as a big concession from India and denote that the Modi government is willing to forgive and forget. But as of now the indications are that Modi won't give them an appointment, citing his busy schedule considering that the budget session of Parliament is scheduled to begin from January 29, with the tabling of the Economic Survey. The MEA has confirmed that the Maldivian foreign minister will be calling on PM Modi on January 11 evening. Significantly, Maldives happens to be the only neighbouring country which Modi hasn't visited. He was scheduled to visit the country in March 2015 but cancelled the trip at the last minute after the Gayoom government arrested former president Mohammed Nasheed, a friend of India, under trumped up charges of terrorism and sedition. Since then, India-Maldives relations have been strained. What has greatly upset the Modi government is that the Maldivian media known to be have allegiance with President Gayoom, has criticised PM Modi for his pro-Hindu politics and called him names. Maldives, a tiny nation with a population of just about 4 lakh people (in contrast Delhi's Karol Bagh has a population of over 5 lakh), is a hundred per cent Muslim nation. The   is watching the developments closely and doesn't want Modi to meet the Maldivian ministers. India would be giving a mouthful to the visiting Maldivian ministers over the issues mentioned above and would like to know what concrete actions the Gayoom government has taken or proposes to take in the near future to take care of Indian interests and sensitivities. For example, India would like to see reversal of some India-centric policies that the Gayoom government has implemented over past few weeks. India would like to have a firm commitment from Maldives that it wouldn't unleash its media to poke India in the eye. Some of the statements from Gayoom himself have muddied the waters. Gayoom has of late made several remarks at his public functions wherein he has castigated India without naming the country. The Indian position is that that such remarks, coming from the head of the government, have been too harsh and detrimental to the larger cause of good relations between the two SAARC member states. India would also like to have a commitment from the Gayoom government to have an inclusive domestic policy wherein the Opposition is taken on board, not victimised and repressed as is the trend. India would like to have an assurance that Maldives won't do anything to gag democracy and accord due space to the Opposition given the Maldivian presidential election are due in about eight months. The biggest talking point of India will be to convey a message that Maldives shouldn't play the China card in its dealings with India, something which another SAARC nation Nepal has been doing for decades. While India cannot tell Maldives not to have close relations with any foreign power, including China, New Delhi would be making it clear that Maldives would be playing the China versus India strategic game at its own peril. India is quite upset over the fact that while its envoy in Maldives Akhilesh Mishra is having his movements severely restricted, the Chinese ambassador is being given a special treatment. India is concerned over the manner in which Maldives has on the one hand been wooing China but on the other hand tightening screws on India. Under the Gayoom regime, the Chinese strategic footprints in Maldives have been growing larger and larger while India has continuously been cold-shouldered. The social media trends mirror this situation very well. For example, while workers in Maldives from other countries have been living in shanties, the Chinese have been building plush permanent structures for their workers. But India has its own leverages with regards to Maldives, especially considering the fact that it's much closer to Maldives geographically than powers like China. Also, Gayoom is not unmindful of the Indian leverages. That's why he is sending his ministers on a diplomatic mission.

That is a victory for women, democracy, as well as secularism, but not many people see it that way yet. Let us consider the plight of the average woman in the world today, with US President Donald Trump also being charged with sexual assault in a lot of anecdotal references. Let us also consider the plight of the average Muslim in India, and now consider the plight of women in this light. There is no case one can argue in favour of the men, the husbands of the country, with regard to an issue of their wives’ rights, especially in the case of a right that is well known to be necessary for any human being, not just a Muslim woman. In the 1980s, when Rajiv Gandhi interfered in the famous  case, there were protests that the interference was setting up a dangerous precedent. Thirty years later, the politics of polarisation has resulted in a short, but dangerous history of demolitions, riots, burning of trains, and attacks on non-vegetarians. Now that the government in power, which may well have benefited from the said bloody history, is trying to undo the damage, people (mostly men) are protesting against the new law. They cite that it would be contrary to the prescriptive morals of their way of life. And from their point of view, they may even be right. But the fact remains that a large number of women suffer and have suffered due to the obvious disproportionate distribution of rights between men and women when it comes to the subject of breaking marriages. Some would even say that divorce should be outlawed in Hindu societies, which is also symptomatic of the lack of rights women share globally. The other extreme would say that divorce is fine, but that only men have exclusive rights with regard to divorce. How on earth can one justify the ending of a marriage so arbitrarily when even relationships are seemingly impossible to let go of in an arbitrary fashion? The question of the legitimacy of the bill to criminalise triple talaq is not even relevant here. An appeal to one’s most basic shred of a conscience is enough to justify the legitimacy of women’s rights. Have we all disrespected women so strongly for so long that one has to   that women and men should have equal rights to say the least? Whether this new policy and corresponding law of the Hindu-majority government will be beneficial in the practical sphere or not is subject to the tides of time, but the sheer legitimacy of this law is unquestionable in most commonly held views on ethics. The rest is our choice, sociological or ideological. Secularism implies non-interference in social matters pertaining to religion. However, women’s rights along with many other rights ordinarily considered fundamental to democratic societies are more important for the larger sake of secularism itself. How can it be that through non-interference in social laws the government can protect social rights? Interference of any sort in the metaphysical sphere of things in understandable, but Lord Benedict’s arguments for criminalising Sati a few centuries in the past under the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy, one of India’s premier intellectuals, is as valid today as it was then. If one sees exploitation occurring around them, the first reaction should be to interfere, as positively as possible, to curb that exploitation. The BJP government may hold allegations of inhumanity against them, but a step towards egalitarianism is far more human than burning women alive for dowry, arbitrarily breaking marriages which are alleged to be made in heaven, or forcing girls into child labour. The very fact that the Opposition is not opposing this bill severely is enough proof that even our liberally hated politicians of Delhi are synergistically showing signs of reform. When the Congress majority government of the 1950s decided to implement a uniform codification of all personal law with respect to Hindu law, the then right wing had decided to oppose such change. Now, it is believed that the right-wing government in power may be stepping further towards a uniform civil code for all. Uniformity of social policing notwithstanding, the fate of women is an issue in its own right, globally, and should not be denigrated to a low-key fight for communal compartmentalising. Demonetisation may have allegedly been a failure. However, politically it benefitted Modi, on account of the divide that it created between the rich and poor of our nation. Triple Talaq may be a failure in reality, but it has added to the divide between Muslim women and men. If men do not wish for militaristic feminism in the manner of communist militarism between haves and have-nots, they should tread this line further, namely that of the middle path, protecting women rights without allowing rogue elements to twist the debate in their patriarchal favour. Sooner or later, the consciousness of matriarchy shall step in and destroy the absurd injustices of a thousand years. But until then, the men, leaders, minority spokespersons and such should be forewarned. Women are human, as human as our grandfathers who drove out the British, and eventually, an evil establishment fails through its own contradictions.","date":"2018-01-06","tag":"BJP,Gender Equality,Muslim women,Triple talaq bill","title":"Triple talaq bill: Is it a social reform or a political weapon?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/triple-talaq-bill-muslim-women-gender-equality-bjp/story/1/21584.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15333},{"author":"Rajeev Dhavan","content":"The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Bill 2017 or the triple talaq bill is a vindictive outcome of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shayara Bano case of last year. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons (SOR), the bill traces its moral authority to fulfil the Supreme Court’s decision that instant divorce (talaq-e-biddat) after three pronouncements was illegal. The SOR says, “The judgment vindicated the position taken by the government that talaq-e-biddat is against Constitutional morality, the dignity of women and principles of gender equity guaranteed under the Constitution.” This, according to the SOR, was in contradistinction to the view of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which wanted to issue advisories. The very wording of the SOR displays a sense of triumph against the Muslim community, a sort of posturing by the government over the Muslim community through the bill. The government’s reading of the Supreme Court judgment is hopelessly misleading. The minority view (of ex CJI JS Khehar and Abdul Nazeer) was that instant talaq is a recognised Islamic practice and it was for the Parliament to intervene if it wanted to. The need for government legislation follows from here. The split majority struck down instant talaq for different reasons. One view was that it was contrary to Islamic law (Kurien), the other that it violated constitutional equality (Nariman–Lalit). The government’s flowery reference to constitutional morality and gender \"equity\" is based on this latter minority view because the second majority judgment simply declared it contrary to Islamic law. The bill emanates from the imagination of the government to (a) showcase Muslim law as unjust and (b) instrument a careless and vindictive law to break up Muslim marriages. Once the court declared instant talaq to be illegal and unconstitutional, the simple declaration in Clause 3 outlawing any form of instant triple talaq was enough: “Any pronouncement of talaq by a person upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever is illegal.” At first blush, Clause 3 gives the broad impression that “talaq” itself is illegal. Of course, “talaq” in the definition clause limits the bill to talaq-ebiddat or all forms of instant talaq. A clever presentation — too clever. But after the SC declaration that instant talaq is illegal, this meant the marriage subsists with all the obligations of Islamic law. Here the bill takes an “ugly turn”. It assumes that although instant talaq is illegal, but with its pronouncement, the marriage itself has broken down requiring remedial action. It gives the right to subsistence allowance and custody of children to the wife similar to divorce proceedings when marriages break up. The bill assumes that the illegal declaration of talaq by the husband virtually breaks up the marriage requiring questions of subsistence allowance to be adjudicated by a Magistrate. In other words, the declaration of instant talaq accelerates a marriage breakdown when the real purpose of the Supreme Court and, supposedly the bill was that the marriage remains alive and well. But the bill regards the very utterance of instant divorce as a kind of breakdown or judicial separation requiring magisterial intervention on maintenance and custody. This is the evil effect of the bill to break the marriage rather than cement it. Why “subsistence allowance”? If instant talaq is illegal, the wife is lawfully wedded with full privileges of a wife. “Subsistence allowance” is a step down — legislative cruelty denying the wife and children total rights. How absurd can this be? A fully wedded wife not legally divorced by her husband will be entitled to only adjudicated subsistence for herself and her children. This part of the bill is antigender, anti-SC judgment, anti-common sense and directed to break up marital relations. The fully wedded wife would run off to a Magistrate for what happens in judicial separation or divorce for relief. Husband and wife are put in legal attrition Finally, the criminality provisions are provocative and irresponsible. Clause 7 means that if the husband utters the instant talaq words, he would commit “an offence which is cognisable and non-bailable”. This means he can be arrested by police and remain in investigative custody unless the Magistrate intervenes. Is this designed to cure the marriage or perpetuate discord? Everything illegal is not a crime. Making it criminal, distorts the relationship between parties. The BJP uses its majority in Lok Sabha to do what it likes. On December 20, 2017, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad answered that after the SC judgment, 99 cases of instant talaq were reported. Is that enough to punish the Muslim community, causing legal quarrels between husband and wife and sending the husband to jail for up to three years. The debate was sparse. The Opposition quiet. So what if they were in a minority, the Opposition should have torn apart the whole bill (not just the penal provisions). In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition put up a fight. But gradually it also caved in — agreeable to compromise on the pen provision not being cognisable and non-bailable. The bill was not passed in the Winter session. But it should be circulated for public opinion or, at least, sent to a select Parliamentary committee as demanded by some members. This is an unfair bill produced by BJP majoritarianism.

He belongs not just to the world of movies, but is part of folklore. He is a metaphor for the miracle we call films. His very entry brought a democratic ease to film. I remember Rajinikanth was a bus conductor. He was once asked by a journalist, “If you had not been a bus conductor-turned-film star, what would you have been?” Quick came the answer, “Oh, a smuggler or a bootlegger.” Rajini was emphasising the fundamental equality of all occupations in the informal economy, from where Kollywood scripts often originate. That was decades ago. When Rajinikanth announced he is going to join politics, start a new political party, the enthusiasm did not work out like the release of his films. The DMK and the AIADMK felt he was not real enough for politics. Many academic activists were even dismissive, arguing that Rajini had taken no real stands in politics. But the problem is a more complex one. Rajini is older. Maybe legends do not age, but Tamil Nadu as a society has. The golden age of politics and its creativity, reciprocity to film is over. Annadurai and MGR are gone, the DMK under Stalin appears a bit like a political still life. The DMK-AIADMK battles that dominated the last few decades create little excitement. In fact, the most exciting person in Chennai is Jayalalithaa. Even as a dead person, she could sweep the election. She has the charisma even as memory to make crowds hysterical and hysteria can flow like a religious current in this city. But what is more obvious than Jayalalithaa’s absence as presence is the emptiness of Tamil politics. Despite being a corrupt prima dona, Jaya had the makings of a Tamil deity. There is a touch of the lukewarm to Rajini’s entry. Probably English language newspapers are more deadpan about it. They make his entry sound like a benign Rotary club meeting. But once one hears Rajini in Tamil, he seems a different person, more in command, almost prophetic about the new digital constituencies he is planning to create. Rajini still offers the politics of hope Tamil Nadu so desperately needs. One break on this move reaching a cinematic climax is the political future of another great star, Kamal Haasan. Haasan too wants to enter politics and make a difference. His seems more the voice of the left, but one is not clear whether Haasan is speaking of his sympathisers on the left or of a need for a fully articulated leftist ideology. While both still stand like Achilles before their tents, Amit Shah and BJP seem busy. They realise the potential of the moment as all the big parties seems dormant. They realise that the creation of a Trojan horse would have a deadly effect, but one wonders whether Tamil Nadu would forgive any one for playing a Trojan horse in a cinematic sense. Tamil Nadu as a society has always been proud of its autonomy from Delhi. Even Modi at the height of his power cut little ice with Jayalalithaa. Yet it is the emptying of politics that haunts one. Tamil Nadu lacks a Periyaar, a Kamraj, a Rajaji and an Annadurai. Each could have mobilised the imagination. Today’s party leaders stand like Uriah Heaps, their very secondariness is so obvious.  The very emptiness of political space is begging Rajini to enter. He realises that he has to offer something new and that the newness of his politics has to at least match the enthusiasm Delhi felt for Kejriwal before he became a more domestic figure. Rajini claims he wants to create a political revolution, the beginning of a spiritual politics. I guess it is his way of saying he wants to initiate an honest politics without invoking a critique of Jaya or DMK. He talks of a politics devoid of caste and religion. I guess what he is looking for is sociology of a new constituency different from the current vote banks that have tied up politics into predictable rhetorical grids. What he is hoping to trigger is a generational change in livelihood and lifestyle, which could redefine society. The script as it stands today sounds empty, or at best, well-intentioned. Rajini does not project the ease of politics. He stands like a star waiting for a cue from the director, desperate for the right plot and the right lines. But the moment, in terms of its timing, has tremendous potential. A new generation wants to rewrite society and Rajini has the stature to lead them. Maybe it is time civil society came to his aide, preparing an ideological programme, and create a new reciprocity between civil society and politics. One is thinking in particular of an attempt to revive the fate of agriculture, marked by epidemics of suicide. What is true of farming is also is also becoming true of fishing. The recent impact of Cyclone Ockhi revealed that the Tamil Nadu politician had no sense of the travails of deep sea fishing. If livelihood politics, human rights and ecology were to combine once more embedded in a theory of culture and the creativity of language, Tamil Nadu can offer a new politics to a Modi embroiled India. I do not think this is the time for cynics or for so-called realists to say that Tamil Nadu politics will continue to see-saw between factions of the Dravidian movement. Rajini has the charisma, and civil society, composed of ecologists, feminists, educationalists, can provide the content for a progressive dream. Like a good actor, Rajini knows how to pick his cues and like a charismatic politician, he can give such ideas a drama, a force which can create a new dream of politics. Society cannot play spectator for long. It has to script the new dream of politics, brushing aside the tiredness and staleness of the old profession politician. It is time for the miracle to happen.

As Maharashtra descended into chaos following the violence orchestrated by rightwing leaders Sambaji Bhide Guruji and Milind Ekbote during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the  , the BJP found itself torn between condemning the rabble-rousers and asserting a pro-Dalit stance to shed the party's label of being an upper-caste party. What seemed easier, obviously, was to keep quiet. In Maharashtra's history of Dalit versus others, two incidents in the past saw a major shift in political dynamics. Back in early 1980s, the Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence when egged on by his \"troubled conscience\" former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar University. After a 16-year-old campaign - Namantar Andolan - Dalits half-succeeded in renaming Aurangabad's Marathawada University to Dr BR Ambedkar Marathwada University. Pawar though was made to pay for his \"altruism\" later as he lost the support of the Maratha community even as Shiv Sena, which strictly opposed the renaming move, further strengthened its base. Pawar, who used to enjoy considerable popularity in the area, could never \"recuperate\" and lost his base among the Marathas. Several attempts to undo the hurt failed as the Namantar Andolan had left the fissures wide open. In another incident which went on to change the political equations in the state, Mumbai police, back in 1997, opened fire upon residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar who were protesting against the desecration of Ambedkar's statue. The police firing claimed as many as 10 lives. The incident led to significant unrest throughout Maharashtra, including rioting and social boycotts against the protesting Dalits.  Although the then Shiv Sena government justified the police action, many couldn't overlook the fact that those in power find it justifiable to use excessive force to muzzle Dalit assertion. This particular incident brought together Dalit groups, including the one led by Prakash Ambedkar and Ramdas Atahawale. The impact of the Ghatkopar incident could be seen in 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Despite riding high on the Ram Mandir issue, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine was brought to its knees by the grand coalition of all republican factions with the Congress and its allies winning 37 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats. Pramod Mahajan too lost his Mumbai North East seat (Ghatkopar East and West Assembly segments fall under Mumbai-North East) due to wide spread anger against the police brutality in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar. The following year in 1999, the Shiv Sena-BJP lost the Assembly elections in Maharshtra. Following the latest spate of violence in Maharashtra, many believe the Bhima-Koregaon episode could prove to be chief minister Davendra Fadnavis' Ramabai Nagar moment.  Even though Fadnavis has been patting the back of his government \"for not letting the violence go out of hand\", the Sena, this time, tore into the BJP government over the violence saying \"the only work left [for the BJP] is to fight elections using the government machinery and the police\". While the BJP doesn't have any prominent Dalit face in Maharashtra, the Bhima Koregaon violence, in all likelihood, will only increase the party's dependence on Union minister Ramdas Athavale, who for years was a staunch opponent of the RSS. The BJP for long has tried to shed its upper-caste label. In 1990s, Parmod Mahajan tried to break the BJP's image of a \"shetji bhatji’ (Baniya-Brahman) party with the help of Gopinath Munde by wooing the OBCs. While Munde became the BJP's OBC face, Dalits still remained far away. Dalits, who form around 11 per cent of the population in Maharshtra, have been a solid social block behind the Congress and Pawar's NCP. After winning the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP tried its best to bring the Dalits into its fold. It was precisely why Athawale - one of the prominent Dalit faces of Maharashtra - was brought to Rajya Sabha and then made a Union minister. Despite that, Dalit support to the BJP remains elusive. With the latest spate of violence, the BJP will find it harder to decide whether to woo the Dalits or to rile the Marathas, who form about 30 per cent of the state's population. ","date":"2018-01-05","tag":"Bhima Koregaon,Hindutva,British Rule,Peshwa","title":"How Bhima Koregaon violence poses a major risk to BJP's Dalit politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-upper-caste-bjp-fadnavis-brahmins-dalits-atrocities-violence-hindutva/story/1/21563.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15336},{"author":"Chandra Kumar Bose","content":"\"Rose early but found Prabha still suffering. A son was born at midday..,\" reads a brief entry in Janakinath Bose's diary dated January 23, 1897. The newborn, the ninth child of Janakinath and Prabhabati Devi, was named Subhas. Janakinath was then practising law in Cuttack, in the state of Orissa. He headed a large extended family.   later recalled in his autobiography,  , he felt \"like a thoroughly insignificant being. My parents awed me to a degree\", in the family. It is now 121 years since the birth of Subhas Chandra Bose, and 73 years since his last known journey out of South East Asia, reportedly to the Soviet Union, in mid-August 1945. On January 23 every year Subhas' birth anniversary is celebrated across India. Speeches extolling Bose's charisma and personality, his unique contributions towards Indian independence continue to be made, and stirring national songs continue to be sung in his honour. On that day, in addition to institutionally sponsored events, spontaneous remembrance ceremonies organised by neighbourhood and citizens' groups also take place. This is a unique feature associated only with   birth anniversary which reflects the depth of people's veneration for him after more than half-a-century of his disappearance. This, in a sense, is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life to liberating India from British colonial rule, and had a vision to make \"Free India\" one of the leading nations in the world. But January 23 will pass and Bose will again be relegated to the pages of history. Though deified by many, his ideology and mission are forgotten. Worse, they are not even known by the younger generations of Indians. From his entry into the Indian political movement in the early 1920s, through his prison years and bouts of serious illnesses, Subhas had developed his thoughts on social, political and economic issues which then formed the basis of his ideology. His famous address as the president of the 51st session of the Indian National Congress at Haripura in 1938 contains the crux of his political and economic thinking and plans. Is it widely known that it was in Haripura that Subhas launched the very first Planning Commission for India? In all his key addresses in India and abroad, in articles published in various journals, Subhas articulated his vision for a free India. In his view, the most important problems to be addressed in independent India were that of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, challenges which have not been met even after 70 years of independence. Together with the celebratory functions, a more fitting tribute to Subhas' memory will be to effectively propagate his vision and ideology, which will in turn promote a better understanding of the history and politics of India, and also inspire the present generation of Indians to shape the country on the basis of the high moral values and principles that Subhas stood for and practised all his life. Subhas' works should be part of school and university curricula. Research institutes, including Netaji Subhas Foundation, Kolkata and London, should actively encourage and support national and international scholars to reassess Subhas' role in the Indian independence movement, and also his contemporary relevance. A deeper study of his works will show that many of his social and economic plans still remain valid. In the current Indian situation where there is a bankruptcy of leadership, ideas, commitment and action, Subhas' message, through his writings, speeches and commentaries may help to resurrect the failing morale of those who are working to bring positive change in this country. Above all,   life-long emphasis on the importance of communal harmony and unity among people, irrespective of birth, caste, creed and religion, has not only remained relevant, it has also gained a sense of urgency. In a world torn by ethnic, tribal, religious and regional conflicts, Bose's unqualified rejection of bigotry of any kind from the very outset of his entry into the Indian political scene, and his repeated call for unity among all Indians, famously reflected in the motto of the Indian National Army - Unity, Faith and Sacrifice, alone can help create a secure foundation of contemporary India. Conscious of the grave danger that communalism posed to a country such as India, where people of many faiths were inextricably mixed together over centuries, Subhas had repeatedly warned against the virus of religious bigotry entering the fabric of politics. In referring to what should be the attitude towards religion and caste, Subhas had declared \"... the government of free India must have an absolutely neutral and impartial attitude toward all religions and leave it to the choice of every individual to profess or follow a particular religious faith\" (The Fundamental Problems of India, address at Tokyo University, November 1944). Subhas' legacy will be better served if he is brought alive through his works. However, there is another reality. During the time of the British Raj, Subhas was treated as enemy No 1 and his book  , banned across the coutry. This is understandable and could have been expected from a colonial power determined to hold on to India and ready to suppress any threat to its rule. It is therefore particularly ironic that after the government of free India took charge, a systematic attempt was made to reduce Subhas merely to a Bengal hero, who though deemed idealistic, was seen as a misled individual, and had made the terrible mistake of discarding Mahatma Gandhi's non violent ways in India's freedom struggle. It is only because Subhas had entered the minds and hearts of the Indian people, and of the peoples of Asia, that all attempts at diminishing his stature and role in Indian and global politics have not fully succeeded. The role of the first government of independent India under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in this process of suppression and distortion cannot be ignored or denied. Historians have noted that Nehru had always perceived Subhas as his main rival, and his own statements bear evidence to that fact. Subhas himself had once written that \"nobody has done more harm to me personally and to our cause in this crisis than Pandit Nehru\" (letter to his nephew Amiya Nath Bose, April 17, 1939). As more evidence begins to emerge, it will be possible to make an objective and proper assessment of the role and personalities of our leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and others. When in August 1945 Subhas disappeared, his beloved elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose was in prison. Sarat and Subhas had shared an extraordinary relationship as brothers. Their close personal and emotional bond was enriched and deepened by their shared social and political ideology and goals. After Sarat was released in September 1945, he immediately resumed his campaign for a free and united India. He also decided to acquire the family's ancestral house on Elgin Road in Calcutta to establish an institution for the study and propagation of Subhas' ideology. In 1946, Sarat inaugurated \"Netaji Bhawan\" at their ancestral house and laid the foundations for a Netaji museum and research centre in the name of his brother, who was by then popularly known as Netaji (our leader). It was Sarat's wish that the Bose house should also be used for public and charitable purposes. The Azad Hind Ambulance Service, which he started, provided much-needed medical and social services in the city, especially during the dark days of communal strife. These were tumultuous times for Bengal and India as a whole. A new alternative was beginning to emerge in Bengal's political firmament. Hope turned to Sarat Bose to carry the torch ahead. He became the undisputed leader of the Congress in West Bengal. He was then elected leader of the Congress in the Central Legislative Assembly and became the leader of the Opposition. Sarat's membership of the interim government was, however, short-lived. He left the interim cabinet and the Congress refusing to agree to the partition of India on communal lines. Within a few years, a greater tragedy was to strike. On February 20, 1950, the very morning Sarat was to make an urgent appeal to the people of the two Bengals to reunite, he suddenly passed away. In an attempt to keep alive Bose's legacy and to give it concrete shape, the close followers of the Bose brothers, supported by Sarat's family, set up Sarat Bose Academy at Netaji Bhawan in 1952. It gathered within its fold eminent historians, lawyers, journalists and other committed voluntary workers. It also attracted interested persons from overseas. The academy launched an ambitious programme to develop Netaji Bhawan as a centre of excellence for research and exchange on both national and international affairs. It also aimed to function as a centre for the promotion of arts, music and languages, while continuing to provide other public services. It was to be the main archive for the works of Sarat and Subhas and for all types of documents and records related to them. The major objective of collecting key documents as well as photos and films on the life and activities of Subhas Chandra Bose began in earnest. Amiya Nath Bose, general secretary of Sarat Bose Academy, who took up his father Sarat's mantle, engaged himself fully in this task. He collected a substantial amount of materials, including primary documents, newspaper clippings, journals, films and other stuff on Netaji's activities both from India and abroad. All of these materials were deposited at the Netaji Museum and archives to be made available \"... to students and scholars for the study of and research about the life and work of Netaji...\" The Sarat Bose Academy began publication of Subhas and Sarat's works, and set up a comprehensive photographic exhibition portraying the life and work of the Bose brothers. By the late 1950s, significant progress had been made in the collection of materials for the Netaji Museum and its archives, and it was concluded that it would be appropriate to create a separate body \"to undertake a systematic study of Netaji's life and mission\". This ultimately led to the creation of the Netaji Research Bureau in 1957 under the chairmanship of well-known journalist Satya Ranjan Bakshi and Sisir Kumar Bose (a son of Sarat Bose) as general secretary. Thus, Netaji Bhawan, with its three main organs - Sarat Bose Academy, Netaji Research Bureau and Azad Hind Ambulance Service - was designed to act as the lead institution to uphold and promote the Bose brothers' legacy, and to work towards realising their cherished goals. However, here again the forces bent upon destroying the legacy went to work. Gradually, the Netaji Research Bureau came under the direct influence of the Nehru dynasty dominated central government. The Sarat Bose Academy moved out of Netaji Bhawan. Netaji Research Bureau became the only organ to remain under the directorship of Sisir Bose. Since its inception until now, over a period of 61 years, the Netaji Research Bureau has accomplished one of its basic goals and has published in 12 volumes, almost all of the writings, speeches and letters of Subhas, the bulk of which was originally collected under the auspices of Sarat Bose Academy. The Netaji Research Bureau has reportedly obtained substantial funding from the central government. But judged against its own objectives, and what was envisaged by its founders, the work of Netaji Research Bureau may be said to have been limited. Netaji's own works are not widely available, and conditions to access the archives at Netaji Bhawan are obscure. Was there a price to pay for support from those who have an interest in keeping the Bose brother's legacy in check? In view of the current realities of India today, those who believe in Subhas' ideology and its relevance in contemporary India, must take the initiative to revive, disseminate and act on the basis of that ideology. Such initiatives are already being taken by certain civil society and media groups both in India and abroad. A website is being launched by The Bose Legacy - www.theboselegacy.com - which will be an online archive for all of Subhas' works, a data base of bibliographies and scholars. It will also contain photographs and audio-visual material. The overall objective is to provide access to relevant materials to all those who wish to study the life, activities and ideology of Subhas, and also to those who wish to define their actions in terms of Bose's vision of India and the world.

From small mandals (groups) to chowks, almost everything is named after Hindutva icons. No wonder the controversial Sambhaji Bhide chose this place as his Karma bhoomi. On reaching Sangli on December 4, we saw a huge procession in support of Bhide, who is fondly called as Bhide Guruji by his followers. The 85-year-old founder of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is accused of orchestrating the violence at the   of the battle fought 200 years ago in Bhima Koregaon. As we headed towards his house in Gaonbhag area, we were told that Guruji does not carry a cellphone (or \"bhraman dhwani\" as he calls it). So once he picks up his bicycle and leaves, no one knows his whereabouts. The Datta Niwas building is situated in a narrow bylane of the old town. A police van was parked outside the lane, even though Bhide has not been provided any security cover. As we neared his house, it seemed almost everyone knew the way to his first-floor abode. However, much to our disappointment, we found ourselves staring at a lock on the door. We left a small note at the doorstep. Not too many people know about the staunch Hindutva ideologue, especially outside Maharashtra, but for those who have closely followed the state's identity politics, Bhide Guruji is a familiar name. An ardent follower of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, many say, Bhide's real name is Manohar but he calls himself Sambhaji after the Maratha king. Maratha organisations like Sambhaji Brigade or Maratha Mahasangh allege that Bhide, who is an upper caste Brahmin, deliberately professes Maratha history in a Brahminical perspective. Guruji has a sizeable following in western Maharashtra, particularly in Sangli district, and parts of neighbouring Karnataka. The man with a magnum moustache is usually dressed in a white kurta pajama or dhoti, but never wears a footwear - no matter where he goes. His followers say that Bhide is an MSc in nuclear physics from Pune University and has also served as a professor in Pune's Fergusson College long ago. In Sangli, Bhide is often seen riding a bicycle. He delivers sermons on Shivaji and Sambhaji, most of which are focused on the warrior kings as Hindutva icons. In 2009, he found himself embroiled in a controversy when communal violence broke out in the twin cities of Miraj-Sangli in Sangli district during Ganpati visarjan over an arch, sporting a poster that depicted the slaying of Afzhal Khan - the most capable commander of Ali Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate - at the hands of Chhatrapati Shivaji. It was reportedly erected just a day before Ganesh visarjan. Even though many demanded his arrest, Bhide came out \"victorious\" without a single scratch. The man is known for his fiery talks on the lives of Shivaji Maharaj heavily laced with hatred for Muslims. And until the recent Bhima Koregaon violence, which Bhide is accused of inciting along with Milind Ekbote, he was not known to be anti-Dalit. Bhide's Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is mainly known for training youths in physical education. Every year during Navratri, Bhide organises a marathon called \"Durga Daud\". Many prominent politicians in the past have graced the event. Not widely known outside Maharashtra, Bhide made national headlines in 2014 when Prime Minister  , during a 2014 Assembly election rally in Sangli, reportedly referred to the hardcore Hindutva activist as one of his inspirations. \"Bhide Guruji did not invite me here. I came here on his orders,” Modi had said during the rally,\" Modi had said. Those close to Bhide say the once-RSS pracharak split from the Sangh Parivar following difference of opinion with former RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras. Ever since then he has been busy running the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, albeit on the lines of the RSS. Much like the practice in RSS shakhas, we came to know, Bhide and his followers gather at their office every morning for workout sessions. We decided to catch up with him there. On a cold Friday morning, our team reached the Vishnu Ghat on the banks of river Krishna. A group of men had already begun their \"surya namaskar\" amid chanting of mantras. We were told that Bhide usually reaches by 5am. We kept waiting on the stairs of a temple watching another group of senior citizens practising laughter yoga. A while later, Bhide came riding his old bicycle. After greeting us, the first thing he asked us to do was to put aside our cameras. He then asked us to join us in his morning prayers and introduced us to others as \"guests of Sangli from Mumbai\". The prayers started with \"Jayatu Hindu Rashtram (long Iive the Hindu nation)\". While the prayers, offered to goddess Bhawani, praised Shivaji and Sambhaji, it was difficult to miss the religious undertones. After the prayers, the group got ready for another round of surya namaskar. Bhide, we were told, has added two additional surya mantras to the usual cycle in the name of Shivaji and Sambhaji. After we joined him in his workout and prayers, the man seemed comfortable talking to us. As soon as he is asked about the Bhima Koregaon violence, he vehemently claimed innocence and said it was a political conspiracy. He even appealed for a thorough inquiry into the incident. Giving examples from Mahabharata, he told us that even \"lord Krishna had to face allegations of theft\". As he got up to leave on his cycle cutting through a line of followers who had gathered to meet him, it was clear Bhide's no ordinary man.","date":"2018-01-05","tag":"Hindutva,Dalit atrocities,Bhima Koregaon,Sambhaji Bhide","title":"On meeting Bhima Koregaon violence accused Sambhaji Bhide","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sambhaji-bhide-sangli-house-bhima-koregaon-dalit-atrocities-bhide-guruji-violence-hindutva/story/1/21569.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15338},{"author":"Sourish Bhattacharyya","content":"The manufactured outrage over the annual Dalit-led celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the  , unless seen through the pseudo-nationalist lenses, is yet another aggressive Hindutva attempt to muzzle the new Dalit voices that are becoming louder after the marginalisation of the likes of Mayawati and Ramdas Athawale. It is an expression of the venomous bigotry that drives the ill-informed Hindutva narrative - the very same bigotry that sparked off the Karni Sena anger against  , a film purportedly (I use the word deliberately because no one has seen it, apart from Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, outside the CBFC) based on an allegorical Sufi poem written in 1540 CE by a Muslim, Malik Muhammad Jayasi, about a fictional princess from Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka; note, she wasn't a Rajput), who becomes the queen of Chittor, and Allauddin Khilji falls in love with her. Understandably, the country has gone into election mode, and Hindutva loyalists have little to brag about after three and half years in power, except an economy where the fiscal deficit has spiralled out of control, jobs are hard to find, the farming sector is wracked by crises and prices of essential commodities showing no signs of abatement, even as Pakistan continues to kill and maim our braveheart soldiers in cold blood. There's only one way to deflect national attention away from the paralysis of equitable development that has set in. And the cynical strategy is to   to polarise voters - Hindus against Muslims and Christians, and the upper castes against Dalits. It started with the so-called \"love jihad\" and the alleged cow smugglers, but the virus, post-Gujarat Assembly elections, has infected the national discourse. Branding Rahul Gandhi as being anti-triple talaq bill when all his party, along with 17 others, has asked for is a parliamentary select committee review of one provision of the bill, is the latest expression of this nation-corroding argument. Questioning the legitimacy of Jignesh Mevani joining the annual celebrations of the Battle of Koregaon - the victory of a unit of the East India Company (comprising 900 Mahar soldiers) over the Peshwa Bajirao II's army in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, a commemoration whose history goes back to January 1, 1927, when BR Ambedkar started the tradition as an assertion of Dalit opposition to upper caste oppression, which had been institutionalised by the Brahminical Peshwas - is a strand of the same divisive narrative. Any Indian citizen can legitimately join a celebration, even it has political overtones, in any part of the country. If a Bhojpuri film star can represent North East Delhi and become the president of the BJP's Delhi unit, how can Jigesh Mevani be questioned for emerging as yet another national voice of the Dalits? Only those with a Peshwa mindset will parrot (reminds me of Padmavati's parrot in Jayasi's poem) such arguments, including the one linking Mevani with Umar Khalid, who, like any other Indian citizen, has the right to engage in a political or any other activity in any part of the country. This argument is as destructive as the mischievous misrepresentation of the acronym HAJ (Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh) formed with the first letters of the names of the three youth leaders who turned the political tide in Gujarat during the recent elections. Politics aside, let's turn to facts to make sense of the mayhem that just shook Maharashtra: 1) It was Chhatrapati Shivaji, who's much loved by the Hindutva army, who inducted Mahars into his army as scouts and guards of forts. 2) The tradition was discontinued by the Peshwas, who heaped inhuman insults upon the Mahars, like insisting that they have a broom tied to their back (to clear their footprints) and hang an earthen pitcher from their necks to prevent their shadow from \"polluting\" the streets. The celebration of the East India Company's victory in the Battle of Koregaon is not a homage paid to a colonial army, but an assertion of Dalit power against Brahminical oppression. 3) If the celebration of the Battle of Koregaon tantamounts to paying homage to colonialism, then the BJP, too, stands guilty of the same charge because of its opposition in Karnataka to Tipu Sultan, who fought the East India Company till his last dying moment. 4) After the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when British colonial generals, led by Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, floated the myth of the martial races, the Mahars were edged out of the British Indian Army and eventually the regiment bearing the name of the caste was disbanded in 1895. For the Mahars, the army provided an escape from their dehumanised life in a caste-oppressed society, which was why they kept demanding that their regiment be reinstated - a demand that was supported by Mahatma Gandhi's political guru, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and later, the Indian National Congress even though it was opposed to the army recruitment policies of the British Raj. 5) It was the British Indian Army that provided a caste-free upbringing to BR Ambedkar, whose father, Subedar Ramji Sakpal, was a teacher in the Mahar Regiment school at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. That may have been the reason why Ambedkar, as member of the viceroy's Defence Advisory Committee in 1941, made a strong pitch for the revival of the Mahar Regiment. 6) The viceroy accepted Ambedkar's plea and the first battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum in October 1941. In the years that followed until Independence, the regiment expanded steadily, saw action in Burma and Iraq, was among the first to become a machine gun regiment in 1946 (it was then that the Koregaon Victory Pillar, the scene of the January 1 celebrations, was replaced by two crossed Vickers machine guns on the regimental crest), and provided security to refugees during the Partition bloodbath. Post-Independence, it became a more integrative unit with the induction of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujaratis who were rejected as non-martial by the British. The Mahars today are 21 battalions strong and have produced two distinguished Army chiefs, General KV Krishna Rao and General K Sundarji. Most importantly, the regiment has given the community back the self-pride that the Peshwas had snuffed out. Hindutva bullies who don't want the Dalits to celebrate their moment of freedom are pursuing cynical electoral manoeuvres that can only lead to one loss - the inclusive idea of India that had been so caringly seeded by Jawaharlal Nehru and nurtured by all those who practise the politics of inclusion.","date":"2018-01-04","tag":"RSS,Hindutva,Dalits,Bhima Koregaon","title":"Attack on Dalits celebrating the 200th anniversary of Battle of Koregaon is a forewarning on what's to come","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-dalits-hindutva-maharashtra-bandh-rss-jignesh-mevani-umar-khalid/story/1/21544.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15339},{"author":"Rajeev Sharma","content":"The real intentions of Pakistan behind the Christmas Day meeting between Kulbhushan Jadhav and his wife and mother - with a glass partition in between - have been exposed by Maulana Ameer Hamza, one of the founders of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). That the entire event was stage-managed by Pakistan to score brownie-points against India was revealed by Maulana Ameer Hamza at a public rally last week in Rawalpindi when he  : \"ISI and Pakistan government humiliated Jadhav's family during their visit to Islamabad. They also made Jadhav face his family across a glass wall… India had requested Pakistan to allow Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet him. Pakistan showed mercy and invited them. India thought that they would meet Jadhav face-to-face on a sofa, but the ISI didn’t allow it.” Hamza's boastful remarks indicate the following: 1) The meeting between Jadhav and his wife and mother was a charade, meant to humiliate the Jadhav family and send a wry message to India; 2) The existence of a nefarious nexus between the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistan government and how the ISI choreographed the entire event though preparations for the meeting were largely between the foreign offices of the two countries; 3) The camaraderie between terror outfits and the Pakistani military establishment as Maulana Ameer Hamza was speaking at a public rally which couldn’t have taken place without the ISI's prior approval and the fact that he sought to lionise the ISI at the Rawalpindi rally. Does it not sound weird that the leader of a notorious terror outfit praises the host country’s premier intelligence agency?

It’s not for nothing that Pakistan is repeatedly hauled over the coals by the international community over terrorism, the latest in this never-ending series being extremely tough remarks against Pakistan by US President Donald Trump. Pakistan took the extreme measure of allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav to meet his mother and wife knowing that they needed to pre-empt any strictures being passed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On September 13, India submitted its written pleadings to the ICJ. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, while responding to a question regarding the development, had stated that \"India has…submitted its memorial (written pleadings) to the ICJ in the Jadhav case involving egregious violation of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 by Pakistan. This is in furtherance of our application filed before the Court on May 8, 2017\". Earlier in May 2017, the ICJ had stayed Jadhav’s execution by Pakistan and had asked both parties to submit their written pleadings by September 13, 2017. Pakistani commentator Ejaz Haider had recently commented in an  : \"That Jadhav is important for India is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by New Delhi approaching the ICJ.\" One could counter that by saying thus: “That Jadhav is important to Pakistan is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by Pakistan constantly using him as a tool to pick on India sponsoring terrorism in Balochistan.”  The reality is that Pakistan got Jadhav on a platter and is using him to the hilt. It needs to be recalled that Jadhav was kidnapped in Iran and delivered to Pakistan by a faction of the Taliban working for Iran. The Taliban sold him to the Pakistanis for a price. And thereby hangs the tale. Pakistan first announced that they would accede to the Indian request to let Jadhav’s family meet him in Pakistan and promptly provided visas for the same on December 20, 2017. However, it is noteworthy that Pakistan did not grant consular access to any authorised personnel of the Indian Mission in Islamabad prior to the meeting, but instead only permitted the family to meet Jadhav. The meeting on December 25 was more of a charade than a meeting on humanitarian grounds. Importantly, the family was not allowed to converse in Marathi with Jadhav, to ensure that the Pakistanis could understand what exchange took place between the prisoner and his family. The family’s meeting with Jadhav, according to their own version, showed that Jadhav was under stress and spoke under coercion. Pakistan subsequently claimed that the procedure followed for the meeting, including asking the mother and wife to change their attire, had been agreed to by both countries in advance, a fact which India has firmly denied. Earlier in September last year, Pakistan's foreign minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, let out a canard that there was a   for a swap between Jadhav and a Pakistani who was involved in the Peshawar Army Public School attack and was said to be in Afghan custody. Asif claimed that India’s NSA Ajit Doval had told him that India could exchange that terrorist with the \"terrorist\" Pakistan had, namely Jadhav. Asif made these remarks while speaking at the Asia Society in New York, but the idea was quickly shot down by both India and Afghanistan. The issue of a swap may well have been discussed at some stage, but there appears to be no reason why Afghanistan should give their acquiescence to an Indian request to let off a known Afghan terrorist in their custody. Furthermore, if one goes back to reports of the terrorist strike at the APS Peshawar, there were six terrorists involved in the attack - one Chechen, two Afghans and three Arabs. In the rescue operation carried out by Pakistani Special Services Group, all six terrorists were killed. So who is this special guy the Afghans were holding on to as Asif claimed in September 2017? The mastermind of the Peshawar attack Omar Khorasani, was killed in a drone strike in October 2017. So much for Pakistan's claims of being the honest dealer and allowing India to meet with the family of commander Kulbhushan Jadhav. By the way, Jadhav is not a serving Indian Navy officer and had, in fact, retired in 2001. He had been working independently in Chahbahar Port in Iran since 2003. At the time of his arrest in March 2016, the Pakistani establishment planted a fake passport on him in the name of Hussein Mubarak Patel and claimed that he was a spy who had worked for India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) since 2013. The Pakistani narrative has always held that he is an active naval officer, a claim that appears false because of two things. First, India would not send a serving naval officer as an undercover agent to Iran. Second, if the officer was serving and had been posted to Chahbahar in uniform he would have diplomatic cover. Meanwhile, on December 25 last year, Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani (a Shia country that the Sunni Pakistan is frantically trying to become close to), while addressing a news conference in Islamabad after attending a six-nation anti-terror conference in Islamabad, said: “Kulbhushan was doing business in Chahbahar and we had no information about him being a spy. The security institutions of both countries (Pakistan and Iran) had already exchanged information in this regard.” It is time for India to call Pakistan’s bluff and continue to work with the international community and increase pressure through the ICJ to get consular access to Jadhav. India must make all efforts to ensure that Jadhav is brought back to India alive. That would be a fitting honour for a former naval officer and an Indian national who deserves better than being a pawn in Pakistani hands.","date":"2018-01-03","tag":"ISI,LeT,Pakistan,Kulbhushan Jadhav","title":"How ISI choreographed Kulbhushan Jadhav's meeting with family to humiliate India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kulbhushan-jadhav-wife-mother-meeting-mea-pakistan-let-isi/story/1/21526.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15340},{"author":"Romita Datta","content":"She had once called her \"Ma/Jangalmahal er Ma\" (mother, mother of Jangal Mahal). And the mother very often would tell others what a good girl she was. Often this mutual admiration would be on the dais of political rallies and government programmes in full public view. This was in 2011 and it continued for seven years as the mother's \"bhalo meye\" - or the good girl - obediently and with the right dosage of obeisance was toeing her line, fulfilling all her wishes and definitely becoming indispensable to her. The daughter in question is Bharati Ghosh, former SP of West Midnapore, and the mother is none other than Mamata Banerjee. Bharati, who was part of a UN peacekeeping mission for years and a former management student of Harvard, came to Bengal in 2011 and drew Mamata's attention after the latter took over as the chief minister of the state. From the state CID, she was made the SP of West Midnapore, which witnessed Maoist violence after 2008. Bharati, with her vast experience in war-torn places of Kosovo and Bosnia, was thought fit to tackle the Maoists. Like an efficient cop, she decimated the Maoists and was responsible for the death of their leader, Koteswar Rao, in a severe gun-battle. The other prominent Maoists operating in that area, and responsible for death of jawans in police camps, were wooed over with handsome packages, and the young turks who dreamt of a classless revolution were won over in the fold of the ruling party with posts, power and privileges. The backward areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore became free of not just the Maoist menace but of any dissenting voices. The districts surrendered and Mamata compensated with heavy doses of development, plugging all possibilities of a Maoist regrouping. And all this was largely possible because of Bharati Ghosh, who dared to be deadly different. Gradually, Bharati gained Mamata's confidence and according to the Opposition, she was less of a police officer and more of a party functionary. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in the 2016 Assembly polls, Bharati  . She was transferred by the EC from the SP's post for allegedly intimidating poll officers and overstepping her jurisdiction. In 2016, she was reprimanded for exceeding her brief and meeting political persons, especially Mukul Roy, then second-in-command of the Trinamool Congress, while model code of conduct was in place. The rap from the EC had no effect on Bharati as Mamata awarded her with prized posting, more power and punch, and greater responsibility. As Bharati went on antagonising Mamata's enemies, she scored brownie points in her career, obviously gaining in the confidence of the chief minister. But finally what soured the relation was Mukul Roy leaving the Trinamool Congress and joining the BJP. Bharati, known to be close and loyal to Roy, became a prime suspect in the eyes of the chief minister. As Roy started consolidating the base of the BJP in the Jungle Mahal area, there were rumours that Bharati was using her clout and muscle power to help him make deep inroads. The final nail in the coffin was the result of the by-election in Sabang in West Midnapore district. Though the Trinamool Congress won with a huge margin of over 67,000 votes and BJP came third, the latter increased its vote share by 17 per cent and that was enough to keep tongues wagging. The Congress-turned-Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Manas Bhuniya, who hailed from Sabang and was a strong critique of Bharati Ghosh since the time he was in the Opposition as a Congress MLA, saw this as an opportunity to turn Mamata against her \"good girl\". There were allegations from the district intelligence office that Bharati had held meetings with BJP leaders and was helping them improve their vote share. Logically, Bharati stood to gain by siding with the BJP. Mamata also had a hunch that Bharati would prefer to work for the party at the Centre given her ambition and career prospects. Immediately after the Sabang by-election results came out, Bharati was removed to an insignificant post as an officer of State Armed Police in Barrackpore. But Bharati   to the DG of police. While the resignation will help her think clearly on what should be the next step, it will also free her of her commitments to the service rules. She is threatening to open her mouth and settle scores. To swallow her resignation would mean handing over an ammo to BJP, since Bharati by virtue of being close to the ruling Trinamool Congress shared many secrets, especially the ones that the \"mother-daughter\" duo exchanged. Mamata has initiated an internal investigation against Bharati Ghosh to ensure she keeps mum, but given the stubborn daughter she is, Bharati might not buckle. Taking up the challenge of a duel, Bharati has also retorted saying that she too has a tale to tell. Any one listening?","date":"2018-01-04","tag":"Mukul Roy,2014 Lok Sabha elections,Bharti Ghosh,Mamata Banerjee","title":"Why Mamata Banerjee and her 'cop daughter' Bharati Ghosh fell apart","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mamata-banerjee-bharti-ghosh-2014-lok-sabha-elections-trinamool-congress-mukul-roy/story/1/21532.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15341},{"author":"Kamlesh Sutar","content":"The usually peaceful celebrations at the Bhima Koregaon village every year to commemorate the battle of 1818, took an unusually   on January 1. The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a \"Bahujan\" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of \"Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak\" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and \"Gau-Brahman prati palak\" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as \"Rayate cha Raja\" (king of the ryots). \r\n \r\n Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ","date":"2018-01-02","tag":"Devendra Fadnavis,BJP,Dalits,Maharashtra","title":"How Bhima Koregaon battle anniversary turned into a riot","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-protests-dalits-killed-maharashtra-bjp-devendra-fadnavis-caste-politics/story/1/21500.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15342},{"author":"Aninda Dey","content":"Donald Trump may have forced   to cringe in his grave. The swashbuckling, swaggering playboy-US Congressman from Texas and   were brothers in arms literally - Pakistan was the conduit for channelling Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who finally started shooting down the lethal, much-feared Soviet Hind copters (Mi-24s) - or \"Shaitan-Arba\" (Satan’s Chariot) - with pinpoint accuracy in Afghanistan. As more planeloads of Stingers and other weapons landed in Pakistan, Wilson and Zia bonded closer. “Yes, Charlie did it,” remarked Zia after the Soviets met their Waterloo and made an ignominious exit. While Wilson loved Pakistan, he hated India. His hatred was evident when he dubbed India hypocritical and a satellite of the erstwhile Soviet Union in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003. “My general experience of Indians is that they are rather arrogant, know a lot more than anyone else about most things and are stiff-necked. Just like the Americans. But I noticed that they changed very quickly once the Soviets collapsed.” However, the Faustian pact the US had struck with the dreaded Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to counter the Soviets continued as Zia bled J&K under Operation Topaz with Uncle Sam turning a blind eye. The devilish deal would come back to haunt the US with Wilson’s rampaging \"Frankenstein\" in Afghanistan transforming itself into Godzilla - the very Mujahideen mutated into the Taliban and the ISI, under its rugged and foxy director Hamid Gul, nurtured the Taliban with Saudi money.   Washington continued to nurture the relationship with Pakistan and billions of dollars in aid flowed into the country. From 2002 to 2016, the US has provided more than $14 billion in aid to Pakistan with the highest assistance of $2,100 million in 2011 - the same year in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hunted down by the Navy Seal Team Six in a house close to Pakistan’s military academy in Abbottabad. The Afghan abyss still stares at the US. Trump blocking $255-million in military aid to Pakistan is perhaps the biggest jolt for Islamabad after Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad. Despite billions of dollars of aid, Pakistan and the ISI has been helping the Taliban, the Haqqani network, LeT and JeM. With the Islamic State (IS) entering Afghanistan, America faces a two-headed snake. Although the US has not given the specific reason for the aid blockade, Trump’s Afghanistan policy - which targeted Pakistan for not doing enough to rein in terrorists - and the threat from the IS and the LeT seem to have prompted the president.      As the IS is rapidly losing ground in Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan could be its next bastion. The threat of IS plotting attacks on the US in Afghanistan looms large. According to the New America Foundation, there have been several IS-inspired attacks on US soil. The IS had claimed responsibility for the attack on an exhibition of Prophet Muhammad cartoons in Garland, Texas, in 2015. In the first IS-inspired attack on US, the two attackers had been in touch with an online recruiter for the terror outfit. In the latest IS-inspired attack in October 2017, Uzbek   Sayfullo Saipov rammed a rented truck into pedestrians and cyclists near the World Trade Center, killing eight. In the worst terrorist attack since 9/11, the IS claimed responsibility for the Orlando gay nightclub attack in which   shot dead 50 people. Although the LeT primarily focusses on India, it poses threat to the US as well. Times Square bomber   was trained by the LeT in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Way back in 2013, Jonah Blank, senior political scientists at RAND Corporation, had raised the possibility of a 26/11-like attack in the US. She told the Committee on Homeland Security, “A Mumbai-style attack - that is, an attack dramatic and shocking enough to inspire widespread terror even without the use of weapons of mass destruction or a casualty-count in the thousands - remains a realistic near-term threat to the homeland. Such an attack might be termed, \"Boston Squared\" - that is, an attack similar to the   in April, but much larger in effect.” Stressing the LeT’s capability, experience and resourcefulness, Blank said the terror outfit had “enjoyed virtually open support from the Pakistani state throughout the 1990s, and has received at least tacit protection from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate since the group was officially banned by Islamabad in 2002”. Top al Qaeda commander Abu Zubaydah was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 2002, in an LeT safe house. “Lashkar-e Taiba is a de facto affiliate of al Qaeda, and is believed to have joined Osama bin Laden's International Islamic Front for jihad sometime after the umbrella group's famous fatwa in 1998,” Blank added. Trump is riled by the continued ISI support to the Taliban and the Haqqani network, which has been frustrating US efforts to come out of the Afghan imbroglio. After more than 15 years and thousands of casualties, the US has failed to beat the battle-hardened Taliban, which now hold sway over 60 per cent of Afghanistan. ","date":"2018-01-02","tag":"Charlie Wilson,Zia-ul-haq,Pakistan,Donald Trump","title":"Trump blocking $255-mn aid is perhaps the biggest jolt to Pakistan after Abbottabad raid","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/trump-pakistan-zia-charlie-wilson-osama-bin-laden-abbottabad-isi/story/1/21507.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15343},{"author":"Anand Balasubramanian","content":"Actor Rajinikanth has launched a  as a quick follow-up to his big announcement of entering politics on December 31, 2017.  Leaving aside the fact that the website is as basic as it comes and looks cluttered, how far will this be helpful in taking his political career forward with the recruitment of new members is the real question. \r\n \r\n Online recruitment is not new in Indian politics. The Congress has an online membership form through which you can become a member of the party without visiting any of its offices. All you need is a copy of your voter ID card. The BJP takes this a step further and gives you an option between becoming a member and online aficionado of the party with portal user-only access. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK and the DMK too allow online enrolment into the party. When it comes to reaching out to their followers, almost all big names have mobile apps. Even new entrants who are yet to launch their parties such as actors Kamal Haasan and Vishal have launched their own apps to connect with the people. While these apps and website will definitely be useful, will it really be a key player in inviting new members into the party? Well, yes. It will attract the current generation who are perpetually glued to their phone screens to join the party or their cause. The only issue is, how to convert these members into actual votes. When one had to visit an office, fill out a form and pay a membership fee, the person joining the party would have to have the intention and the will to join for him to put in that effort. If you belong to the left-wing political parties, you are expected to share a portion of your monthly purse with the party. You will be forced to make a conscious decision of following the ideology of the party and going out of your way before joining it. Even though this is not foolproof, it will at the very least ensure that the person who joins your party has the will to vote for you at the time of contributing to your vote share in the constituency.   When all you have to do is fill up four to five fields in an online form to join a party, you will not only attract the “why not” crowd, but also the mischievous, if not malicious elements. This could lead to embarrassing situations in the future since the party leadership would be answerable for their actions. It would also end up inflating the party numbers and giving false hope to the party leadership. Another question that the party needs to ask itself is if the numbers generated from online membership actually translate into votes in its favour. But make no mistake about it, apps and websites are absolutely essential in today’s age. It will help the party and the leader keep his cadre engaged. Providing an app to existing party members where they would need their party ID to login would help them keep their base consolidated. It will also keep them apprised of the party’s current stand on important issues, rally them for protests and even help them provide effective feedback to the party leadership on the local issues. However, the effectiveness of online recruitment of party members is something that is untested and may prove to be ineffective for a start-up party. If Rajinikanth plans to convert these members directly into party cadre en masse, he would have to be wary of the pitfalls that would ensue with the strategy. For, people who probably do not want to see Rajinikanth in politics, can use the website/app to infiltrate into the party and corrupt his base and image altogether. That is one danger the existing parties with consolidated base which use the app or website for communication is safe from.  ","date":"2018-01-02","tag":"Website,Mobile app,Politics,Rajinikanth","title":"Should Rajinikanth's digital drive worry his political opponents?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-political-party-online-recruitment-android-mobile-app-website/story/1/21509.html","website":"dailyo","_deepnote_index_column":15344},{"author":"Manoj Joshi","content":"When it comes to the Modi government’s foreign policy record, you can see it as a glass half full or a glass half empty. Full or empty, it was half. It did not meet its full potential and there were more misses than hits, especially in the neighbourhood, in 2017. But there was one significant achievement which has made up for this and has important portents for the future. This was facing down Beijing over Doklam which was done with verve and sophistication. So what could 2018 bring? Perhaps its most important motif will be balance. Having stepped out in significant directions in 2015 and 2016 towards the US and Israel, Modi will seek to restore some equilibrium. He will seek to repair ties with China and reach out to Palestine, to signal to the Arab world that Indian policy is not changing. Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanhayu is to visit India in mid-January for the Raisina Dialogue, but that is more about ideological signaling rather than achieving any major foreign policy goal. India is not a player in the Middle East, its primary interest is the stability of this vital region and it would be well advised to maintain its traditional posture of balancing between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the Saudi-Israel entente growing, there could be an argument for a slight tilt in the Iranian direction, else we may see a repeat of a situation where external pressures pushed our ally Russia into the arms of China. Note that Modi’s initiatives in the Gulf sheikhdoms are now paying. Following Modi’s visit in early 2017, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested nearly $3 billion (Rs 19,000 crore)in a range of areas relating to infrastructure and renewable energy. And this, say Indian diplomats in the region, is only the beginning. In 2018, significant developments could also take place in southeast Asia, beginning with the Indo-ASEAN commemorative summit on January, followed by New Delhi hosting all the ASEAN leaders collectively as chief guests at the Republic Day function. Modi’s expected speech at the Shangrila Dialogue in Singapore in early June will be important because it is being delivered at Asia’s premier security meet. This could be a harbinger of deepening Indian commitments in the region to balance China’s activism in South Asia. Having faced down Beijing in Doklam, India is in a good position to engage Beijing. Not much will come from this because issues between the two are not open to quick resolution. In recent years, they have displayed a dangerous tendency not to respond to the numerous CBMs that have kept peace between the two countries in recent decades. We now need newer mechanisms simply to ensure things do not get out of hand. If things go well, we could well see an acceleration of the steadily increasing Chinese investments in India topped off by a visit by Chinese supremo, Xi Jinping. The Chinese understand well that India is a huge opportunity for them. We could well see a negotiated settlement of the Sino-Indian impasse over the Belt and Road Initiative. It is in the context of China that India also needs to pay attention to Russia in 2018. There has been significant activity on the official front in 2017, but a visit by President Putin for the annual consultative summit could restore some vitality to the relationship. Our most important tie will remain the one with the US. It will also be the most problematic. It has so far been Washington’s best managed foreign relationship, but it could rub up against Indian interests relating to Iran and Russia. However, there is every indication that the US is willing to give New Delhi considerable leeway here because its need for India’s weight in the “Indo Pacific” region is significant. And what about Pakistan? There is unlikely to be much of a shift here, considering Pakistan has no real government at present and, perhaps, more important, it remains a useful electoral tool for Modi. He is also likely to visit Davos for the World Economic Forum summit. At first sight, it looks like an attempt to catch up with Jinping who was the chief guest last year. Symbolic attendance at Davos won’t change things. The economy is not going anywhere for a while and Modi must take the blame for that. New Delhi does appear to be in a sweet spot of sorts because of American friction with Pakistan and China. This could grow, for differing reasons, in 2018. This can provide sufficient space to further India’s interests. This is where the rub comes in. It is now widely accepted that Indian economy slowed down on account of self-inflicted wounds in 2017. Hopefully, Modi and his team will not do a repeat in the arena of foreign policy.

lawmaker from Hawaii in the US Congress, is considering a run for American presidency in 2020, according to sources close to her. On Friday, 9 November, at a Medtronic conference in Los Angeles, eminent Indian-American Dr Sampat Shivangi introduced Gabbard, 37, and said that she could be the next president of the US in 2020. The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didn’t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didn’t deny it either. Tulsi Gabbard is an American politician of the Democratic Party serving as the US Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district since 2013. Gabbard, who represents a constituency in Hawaii, is not of Indian descent and neither of her parents are Hindu, but she practises Hinduism. Gabbard was born in 1981 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children born to Carol and Mike Gabbard, a State Senator. In 2002, Gabbard became the youngest person ever to be elected to the Hawaii State Legislative, and in 2012, she was elected to the US House. She went on to win the general election by nearly 80 points. She is one of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, and she was deployed with the Hawaii National Guard to Iraq in 2005 and Kuwait in 2009. According to a report in , Gabbard became one of the most popular political figures after she broke with the Democratic Party establishment and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016, even resigning as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to be able to do so. In 2004, Gabbard volunteered to join the 29 Brigade of US soldiers when they were called to war in Iraq. According to Gabbard’s website, “She (Gabbard) felt it was more important to stand in solidarity with her fellow soldiers than to climb the political ladder.” However, Gabbard’s critics have questioned her views on foreign policy and her tolerance of dictators like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard came under attack after she met Assad in 2017. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Trapper, she said that she hadn’t planned on meeting him but when the opportunity arose, she did, because she felt it was important. Democratic leaders maintained silence on one of their leaders meeting a head of state who has been dubbed a war criminal by the US. Then, in April 2017, Gabbard’s stand on the chemical attack in Syria raised eyebrows again. According to an article in  , in 2015, Gabbard was among the Democrats who voted for restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She had also expressed “skepticism” about the widely held assertion that Assad’s government was behind chemical attacks in Syria. After the 2002 Gujarat riots, the US government had denied a visa to Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Gabbard was one of the few to criticise the US government’s decision. According to an article in  , five months after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India, Gabbard opposed a resolution which called for “religious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials,” saying that it would weaken India-US relations. In August 2014, Gabbard made it a point to meet Modi in New York after his Madison Square Garden speech and presented him a copy of the  that she swore by when she was elected. Before that, in August 2014, speaking at a fundraising event for the BJP in Georgia, US, Gabbard had hailed Modi’s 2014 landslide victory and said, “People (of India) stood up, one by one by one by one, and said ‘we will demand that this change occurs’.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Vivekananda strove to combat superstition, to get rid of the deadwood of ritual that was  stifling those who followed the Hindu way of life, and left behind a large body of written work, reinterpreting the Vedanta for modern times. Vivekananda’s ways were unorthodox. The cigar-smoking monk had no problem with those who ate meat. He freely borrowed from whatever he felt was the best practice in other religions.

Those who are agitated today about the appropriation of Vivekananda by the Sangh Parivar and are desperate to reclaim him, must ask themselves this question – why and how had they remained blind to the multifaceted contributions of this exceptional Indian? Today the Congress and other parties in opposition are desperately trying to get a foothold in the hearts and minds of voters who proudly proclaim their adherence to ‘Sanatana Dharma’.

It would be foolish to suggest or believe that he can be owned and monopolised by any partisan / sectarian group. Indians and foreigners alike will continue to be enriched by his teachings, and Vivekananda will remain a living presence above political skirmishes. Therefore, apprehensions about the misappropriation of Vivekananda are totally misplaced.

It is extremely unfortunate for the bureau, as it hosts officers of impeccable integrity. They would indeed feel disturbed and so would the citizens who frequently demand CBI investigation in complicated, sensitive and controversial crimes. Criminal cases against its former directors – Ranjit Sinha and AP Singh – to say nothing of the unceremonious transfer of its past Special Director Rupak Dutta, tipped to be the director in 2017 – are some of the recent instances that have cast a shadow over the bureau. But more so, on the procedure followed for selecting the top boss of the agency. In the process, merit is relegated to the back burner, as was in the case of the untimely transfer of Rupak Dutta to ‘accommodate’ the current incumbent Alok Verma, and the controversial induction/promotion of the Special Director Rakesh Asthana. The high-powered panel for the selection of the director of the CBI has as three members ie the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. Yet, two of its past directors have been tainted – they have been accused in criminal cases. It is thus a poignant comment on the selection procedure, and a travesty of the highest order. The CBI comes under the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), thus directly under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It has a presence in most states in the country. The Bureau has also been notified as the Interpol of India for the purpose of liaison with police organisations of other countries, and to facilitate cooperation in international cases. There are two types of officers in the CBI – directly recruited officer investigators / support staff, and investigators and supervisors inducted on deputation from outside. The leadership lies with the Indian Police Service (IPS), with officers selected from all over the country. The CBI does not have a policy like the Intelligence Bureau (IB) or Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wherein the officers on deputation can get permanently absorbed. At any given time, there are about 20 percent and above vacancies, for various reasons like state police officers being unwilling to come on deputation etc. As per the CBI manual, the superintendent and above have specified powers for registration of cases, and the CBI follows it scrupulously. An officer of a particular rank can register an economic offence of a particular magnitude at his / her level, and to go above that, they need the permission of the rank above them. Similar guidelines on the basis of ranks exist for registering offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. There are legal advisers at each stage of investigation, and a follow-up of cases in courts is quite good. However, on occasion, the quality of its investigation and prosecution have been criticised by the courts as in the 2G spectrum allocation case recently. At other times, the courts have come down heavily on the CBI’s decisions, with the Supreme Court terming it as ‘caged parrot’ and ‘His master’s voice’. The internal vigilance wing has often nabbed some of its corrupt officers and prosecutors, proving that the CBI has its own black sheep. The pendency of cases however is mounting, despite special courts designated to handle CBI cases. These are issues of serious concern. In most cases, the investigation is of high standard, and the investigating officers are encouraged to pursue the collection of scientific evidence. The conviction rate is higher in CBI cases, as the investigating officers do not have to handle other departments like law and order / security/ VIP duties. They devote their full time to investigation. When I joined the Bureau in 1999, I was impressed by the depth of discussion and focus on investigation. I also found that the investigating officers took much longer to complete an investigation – some in the hope that more cases would not come their way if they go slow on the earlier ones! But by and large, the work culture and environment had been highly professional. During the '90s, the Bureau was given more resources, and the millennium saw special allowances – 25 percent of the pay for ranks up to the Superintendent of Police, and 15 percent, for ranks above it. The officers also feel that they do not have the facilities and amenities of local police investigation units. Still the conviction rate (of above 65 percent), is one of the best in the country. The more recently created National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take decades to come up to the benchmark set by the CBI. In most of the cases, the investigators work independently, but in some cases, there are pressures from different quarters. Most officers are able to withstand these pressures, as documentation is very strong within the CBI. If you are able to justify your stand on paper, it is difficult to be overruled. However, some officers do find cunning ways to bypass these, including taking legal opinion in their favour. Courts intervene occasionally and initiate direct supervision with clear direction not to transfer/shift the investigating officers and the supervisors – as was the case with the investigation of the 2G spectrum allocation case, and coal scam cases. With a professional work culture, a strong internal vigilance wing, and an internationally-acclaimed training set-up, the Central Bureau of Investigation holds its head high – more often than not. On the whole, having worked in the CBI, I can safely vouch for its professionalism, and fervently hope that the current director and special director resolve their differences for a higher cause, that is, the ethos of their organisation. Both officers being from the Indian Police Service, should stand up for the ‘service of the people’ and NOT for ‘the service of the party in power’.

But it is also equally true for the filmmakers themselves, who are often stuck in the past, unresponsive to the present environment, reacting to it only through memories. And then there are those filmmakers who receive an instant emotional blow from the socio-political situation of the present and hurl away the burden of the past to deliver a message for the present. His cinema can be divided into distinct periods, etching out the contemporary sensibilities of the times they were made in. My first experience of a Mrinal Sen film was of    which shows a young boy dying of suffocation on a winter night, in a middle-class Bengali household’s kitchen. I had seen   only too often — working in the houses of some of my friends, whom I would visit after school. Mrinal Sen’s    , which shows a film crew attempting to make a film based on the Bengal famine (set in a village of the day), fuses the horrors of history with the struggles of contemporary life. The classical structure of a ‘film within a film’ has been used by Sen to show how fiction and reality often converge. Durga, an ordinary village woman, who witnesses the film shoot, begins to empathise with a character portrayed in the film. The hardships faced by Durga in real life, and this character, are very similar. Mrinal Sen also depicts the exploitation of the innocent, ignorant villagers at the hands of the privileged film personalities. Sen made this film at a time when he wanted to study characters through a socio-political lens — understanding their responses, moral dilemmas, self-corruption and exploitation, which can then provoke the spectator to start a discussion. In dramas like   and  Sen sheds light on the moralities of the society of the day, especially exposing the so-called Bhadralok (gentleman) culture. In  , a middle-class family’s fate hangs in the balance as their eldest daughter, the sole breadwinner, fails to come home one night. Similarly, in  , the father, the family’s patriarch, goes missing. My understanding of Mrinal Sen completely changed once I went to college and got involved in the politics of the day. I had a lot to say, and I was ready to shout over the burst of other voices. Mrinal Sen started ‘shouting out his own politics’ with his cult-classic   at a time when the Naxalite movement was at its peak, and world cinema was highly influenced by the French New Wave and Czech New Wave. The film is highly stylised with use of freeze frames and stop-motion animation. An animation sequence builds up the character of Shome (who is mostly engrossed in office work) through pens, books, files, sheets, but without actually showing him. Thus, Sen developed a new language for Indian filmmakers, giving birth to the Indian New Wave. The period demanded that Sen shout out his views over ear-blasting bombings and cries of mothers of youths shot dead by police. Mrinal Sen’s   trilogy, a set of overly political films narrated in the new vocabulary of the day, also emerged around the same time. Sen breaks the fourth wall in  , and directly speaks to the camera.  and   the other two films in the  trilogy – both deal with questions of leadership and exploitation by the higher-ups. Sen used ‘juxtaposition’ as an important cinematic tool to jar the spectators out of the illusion of cinema. Mrinal Sen’s cinema has not only inspired other films, but also compelled other filmmakers to document his life and work. The creation of a new wave in Indian cinema, which was subsequently continued by the likes of Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Shyam Benegal, can be credited to Sen. Sen completely distrusts Ramani’s presence and his sensibilities — Sen’s aura, comes out with an absolute honesty in the final documentary, which in the last sequence, cuts to Sen watching himself on screen as Ramani shows him the footage for approval. Mrinal Sen, the ‘master’ smiles at his ‘other self’, jarred out of illusion into realism through his most favourite cinematic device of all — the ‘cut’. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 3 July 1995, Delhi woke up to a crime that was less gruesome in execution but was brutal enough when it came to removing evidence, including the victim’s body. In the post-liberalisation era, even as blaring 24*7 news channels were yet to arrive on the scene, few newspapers made sure that the readers had every salacious bit on their platter daily. The accused Sushil Sharma, a former Youth Congress leader, someone who was known for his proximity to senior leaders, had shot his wife dead and then tried to burn her body.  It was perhaps the sheer grit and dogged effort by Pereira and his team which ensured that Sharma was behind bars. But it wasn’t so easy for the Delhi Police that faced many challenges during investigation, as explained vividly by Pereira in his book,  . This observation was contrary to the claim by the police that Naina Sahni's death was caused due to injury caused by a bullet wound with the shot being fired from a very close range. The police had retrieved bullets and empty cartridges from Sushil Sharma's flat at Mandir Marg where traces of blood were found on the mattress in the bedroom. Just because the X-ray machine at the Lady Hardinge Medical College was non-functional and the body was burnt beyond recognition, the first autopsy report had overlooked the injury mark in the corpse caused by the bullets. It was the second autopsy report that favoured the sequence of events as was established by the Delhi Police in its probe. Pereira feels that such procedural hassles are part of the job for investigating officers: Speaking to  , Pereira also shared how important it was for the police force then in 1995 to win back the confidence of people. Sharma was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2007. On 8 October 2013, the Supreme Court commuted Sushil Sharma’s death sentence to life imprisonment. In its judgment, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, P Sathasivam had  : The Court was of the view that chances of reformation of Sharma can’t be ruled out. Sushil Sharma has already served 23 years behind bars. So should he now be allowed to live a normal life outside jail on grounds of good behaviour? It was this question that resulted in a fierce debate between the author and audience at the book launch. A counselor at the Tihar Jail, who was present at the book launch, shared her experience of interacting with Sharma, as she claimed, “he regrets his action”. In 2016, the Supreme Court   that “a sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years”. Which means that the release of Sushil Sharma would be tough “unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentence”. According to Maxwell Pereira, “the police had done its job and now it’s up to the institutions who take decisions on such matters”. What happened to Constable Abdul Nazeer Kunju, the man, who was on night duty at the Connaught Place police station on 2 July 1995? It was Kunju who had rushed inside the Bagiya restaurant after a woman came out shouting,  It was Kunju who first spotted Sushil along with his friend Keshav as both were busy throwing pamphlets and posters into the fire. ‘He left the police service’, Pereira told the audience, when he was asked about Kunju. After his stint as the hero, who had helped in unravelling a gruesome crime, it was the slow pace of promotion in the hierarchical setup of the police that led to Kunju calling it quits. While Kunju was able to resist all the efforts of Sushil Sharma to intimidate him, the poor guy found it difficult to overcome disillusionment that dawned after years of performing his duties with utmost sincerity. Lack of motivation is perhaps among the many ills ailing the police force. Pereira still reminisces the ability of Kunju to react fast to an unwarranted situation, which in this case, led to the discovery of a charred body:       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 23 November 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were travelling by bus from Hyderabad to Sangli in Mahrashtra. While on the way, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) stopped the bus and abducted the couple. Three days later, on 26 November, Sohrabuddin was shot dead in what the police called an encounter, but it was later found to be fake by the investigators. In total, several prosecution witnesses have deposed before the court since 29 November 2017. The same day, the special CBI court passed a gag order restraining media from reporting the case based on an application by the defence lawyer. On 24 January this year, the Bombay High Court struck down the gag order. According to sources, all hostile witnesses are crucial, and some of them are also eyewitnesses in the case. Among these, five of their statements were recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, while others had theirs recorded by the investigating agency. Below are details of the testimony/statements of 13 crucial witnesses: , the sister of Kalimuddin, an associate of Sohrabuddin, had stated to the investigating agency that her brother hosted Sohrabuddin and his wife in Hyderabad in mid-November 2005. It is from their house that Sohrabuddin and his wife left for Sangli. Kalimuddin was also wanted in several criminal cases by the Andhra Pradesh Police. But during cross-examination, Saleema denied even having met Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi. Saleema’s retraction of her earlier statement will impact the case because this raises questions over whether Sohrabuddin and his wife went to Hyderabad or boarded the bus to Sangli. Here are the names of some other hostile witnesses: According to the prosecution, key witnesses turning hostile is a major setback for the case. According to a legal expert: Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had boarded a luxury bus from Hyderabad to go to Sangli in Maharashtra at around 9 pm on 22 November 2005. But while they were on the way, a group of policemen from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh allegedly kidnapped them. A passenger inside the bus told the investigator that an SUV blocked their bus and three policemen with guns abducted Sohrabuddin and his wife. Kausar Bi refused to allow the police to take him, and so she too was abducted by the police. Based on the statements of some witnesses, Sohrabuddin and his wife were brought to Ahmedabad’s Disha Farm where both of them were illegally detained and later killed, according to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI. According to the Gujarat ATS, Sohrabuddin was a sharp shooter and had underworld connections. He had come to the city at the behest of the Lashker-e-Taiba and the ISI to assassinate a political leader. The Gujarat Police acted on the basis of an intelligence input from the Rajasthan Police, who were also part of the encounter team. The Gujarat Police also claimed that Sohrabuddin was wanted in an arms case in Madhya Pradesh and in a murder case in Rajasthan. According to the Gujarat police, Sohrabuddin was operating from Narol area in Ahmedabad, when the police spotted him riding a bike near the Vishala circle, they tried to intercept but he didn't stop. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sohrabuddin shot at policemen and in self-defence police retaliated, killing him. They offer no explanation for how Kausar Bi was killed. Some key witnesses who are yet to be cross-examined in court are:  once a close associate of Sohrabuddin, turned hostile from his earlier statement recorded before the CBI. In an affidavit before the designated CBI court, witness claimed that the statements attributed to him against the former Deputy Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, Abhay Chudasma, and others, were “taken by the investigating agency under duress.” He also charged the CBI with “acting on the instructions of Congress leaders of Gujarat.” In 2006,  the IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was made the supervisory officer of the Sohrabuddin case before it was handed over to the CBI. Solanki’s investigation revealed that apart from Sohrabuddin, Kausar Bi was also killed as a coverup. This revelation led to the arrests of Gujarat-cadre IPS officers DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian, and Dinesh MN of the Rajasthan cadre. Later, the CBI, in its findings, charge-sheeted Geetha Johri for allegedly botching up the investigation. The agency accused her of projecting that the third person abducted along with Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi was a person named Kalimuddin and not Tulsiram Prajapati. The first investigating officer of the Gujarat Police gave a statement to the CBI against  , saying she was working under pressure from now Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah. She botched-up the case by giving a false report stating that third person on the bus was not Tulsiram Prajapati. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Raje’s government? Pilot goes on to say, “So, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara ji’s government. So it’s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Raje’s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.” From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to ‘Gaurav Yatra’, Raje should have taken out a ‘Pashchatap Yatra’. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congress’s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. It’s illegal, it’s immoral to use taxpayers’ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJP’s money to organise meetings? “Today, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,” continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congress’s counter-narrative to Raje’s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had ‘mera booth, mera gaurav’ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the ‘Shakti’ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. That’s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, “We (Congress) are doing ‘Sankalp’ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.” Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback we’ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So it’s a very positive indication, and I’m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, we’ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And that’s where I think the Congress party’s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Even as the TDP MLA was jailed, a tape was produced (and leaked to TV channels) where a voice suspiciously similar to that of Chandrababu Naidu’s, was found saying something incriminating. This was an opportunity for KCR’s Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to poach TDP MLAs who Naidu had told to fend for themselves. At the same time, to ensure that Andhra industrialists did not flee to Andhra Pradesh leaving Hyderabad high and dry, KCR appointed his son KT Rama Rao (KTR) to woo them. The savvy KTR, who is IT and Urban Development Minister in KCR’s government, was able to win the confidence of these industrialists who were at the receiving end during the Telangana statehood movement. Naidu is hailed as the father of modern Hyderabad, who got Microsoft and other IT investments. But KTR is following in his footsteps and has been able to woo many others. “Hyderabad is a boom town now,” is the refrain of investors. Although he is believed to have strategised Naidu’s victory in 1999, Naidu jettisoned KCR, relegating him to the post of the Assembly’s deputy speaker. A miffed KCR left TDP and formed TRS to fight for a separate state. The new state was created by Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the 2014 elections. Before Telangana was announced, KCR had declared his allegiance to Sonia — who he said was like his own ‘mother’ and even promised to merge his party into the Congress if ‘he was given a free hand.’ But none of this happened, and the TRS and Congress are now arch rivals. Even as KCR wants to decimate the Congress, analysts aver that he has a tacit understanding with the BJP because this is what the saffron party also wants. However, in April 2017, KCR got a bill passed in the Telangana Assembly to provide reservations to backward Muslims in colleges and for jobs. This is unlikely to be notified by the central government, because reservations on religious basis have been struck down by the courts. Moreover, with the latest proposals, total reservations will go way beyond the constitutionally mandated upper limit of 50 percent. KCR, who runs the state with an iron hand and has promoted his daughter and nephew besides his son, is seen as a wily politician with a clear game plan in mind. This is why he is being taken seriously as he unfolds the federal front plan. K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is a man known for setting his goals high. Figuring that the ‘Modi magic’ of 2014 has all but vanished and has not been replaced by a Rahul Gandhi upsurge, KCR is fancying his chances as the next prime minister of India, suggest highly-placed sources. Donning the robe of a messiah, KCR has been announcing that “People are vexed that there is no qualitative change, even after 70 years of democracy.” KCR, as has been reported, travelled to Kolkata to confabulate with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for forming a federal front. He has also met CPM’s Sitaram Yechury with the same idea. The leaders of many likely federal front partners with more seats (like Mamata with 42 seats in West Bengal) might harbour prime ministerial ambitions themselves. But KCR, with his proficiency in both Hindi and English, and being from south India, feels that he has an edge over others (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Kathula Venkataiah, 45, committed suicide like thousands of farmers do every year in India, because of crop failure and unpaid debts. But this farmer suicide was different. A resident of Manimadde village of Shali Gowraram mandal in Nalgonda district, Venkataiah was a staunch supporter of the separate state of Telangana. He had participated in village marches and believed that Telangana’s statehood would be the best solution for the rural distress he himself faced, and witnessed around him. And yet, he killed himself 12 days after the formation of Telangana on 2 June 2014. Inability to repay debt was the main reason for Venkataiah’s suicide; he had owed Rs 4,30,000 at the time of his death, according to official documents. As Venkataiah did not own land, banks had trouble lending to him, and he borrowed from private moneylenders on an interest of Rs 1.50 to Rs 2. This dependence on private moneylenders is despite over 83 percent rural access to bank credit, according to the same report. Further, government schemes like Rythu Bandhu, are meant for farmers who cultivate their own land, and not for tenant/landless farmers who are the worst affected by distress. A report by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with TISS in 2018, finds that 20 percent of land in the state is cultivated by tenant farmers, but they account for 75 percent of farmer suicides in Telangana. The children of tenant farmers face a different challenge; there is no land to farm, and education does not lead to employment. Even with 64.2 percent literacy rate, Nalgonda district has only 49.9 percent working population, according to the 2011 Census. It is not surprising therefore, that after Venkataiah’s death, all his three children dropped out of school to earn a livelihood instead. In Manimadde village, where the family met this reporter this week, they live in a half-constructed two-room house of cement and brick. Part of the state compensation paid after Venkataiah’s death had gone into building the house, but was not enough to finish it. In another part of Nalgonda in Chandanpally village, Rupani Radha recalls the death of her husband, Janayya, in November 2014, four months after the formation of Telangana state. She now supports three children between the ages of 8-14 years, through farm labour, and by cultivating cotton on 2 acres of rain-fed land that used to belong to her husband. The land is now in the name of her 8-year-old son, transferred by her husband’s family after his death. This has proved a hurdle for getting benefits of government schemes as her son is not of age. Welfare had failed to assist her in times of need. For instance, when she had to undergo a surgery for kidney stones in June 2018, she had to borrow Rs 1 lakh from private sources. She says that the free health scheme ‘Aarogyasri’ would have taken time to come though, and she could not wait. And now, after the surgery, the loan has added to her burden as she is unable to do farm labour to repay it. Radha’s only other option is agriculture. “I must work as farm labour to pay for the cotton crop on our field. I have harvested about 5 quintals, which will fetch me about Rs 20,000, but I will make no profit,” she says. But like Narsamma, even Radha must reconcile to the indifference of the state that no longer needs the farmer, except perhaps, during elections.  ‘ ’ by        (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Founded in 1959, by C Rajagopalachari, one of India’s greatest political thinkers and leaders, as well as literary giants, Swatantra Party arrived on the Indian political scene with a bash. The archive features correspondences, office memorandums, meeting minutes, speech drafts, party literature and publications, and many personal notes shared by the party leaders, allowing us a glimpse into the life of the party as it was conceived, formed, and introduced to the larger Indian political scene. A small correspondence between Indira Gandhi and MR Masani, notes shared by Masani and Rajaji are among the many treasures housed in the archive. In the letter issued from the Prime Ministers Office on 12 March 1967, Indira Gandhi invites Mr Masani to join her in an informal meeting with parliamentary leaders, before the inaugural session of Lok Sabha. The letter reads: “I write this to invite you to an informal meeting of Leaders of different Parties in Parliament so that we have an opportunity of meeting one another on the eve of the session and to exchange views on matters of common interest. I should like to maintain similar contact throughout the session if you find the idea appropriate and useful. I wonder if we could have our first meeting at 10 am on 15th March in my office in Parliament House. I hope you will find it convenient to join.” A handwritten note by C Rajagopalachari, addressed to Mr Homi Mody, a lawyer, administrator, businessman, and social reformer is another valuable find. Homi, a moniker for Sir Hormasji Pherozshah Modi, held a variety of public offices as Chairman of Bombay Municipal Corporation (1913), a member of Indian legislative assembly (1929-1943), a member of Viceroy’s Executive Council (1943), a member of Constituent Assembly of India, and governor of United Provinces and Uttar Pradesh (1949-52). In the note C Rajagopalachari expresses his gratitude to Mody for leading the early collection efforts to establish the corpus of funds for the party. Written on 20 October 1959 – Swatantra's founding year – the note states, “It was kind of you to write and give a cheerful account of the collection work. I had intended to write to our staff about the need for active assistance but as I have just read your letter, I feel it is unnecessary. I cannot tell you how greatly I feel heartened by your continued support. Tyranny cannot be brought to an end until the victims shed fear. Our 'friends' are going to get more and more autocratic and dictatorial seeing that we are gathering strength...” The archive has been successfully restored and digitised by the efforts of the Centre for Civil Society as a part of its Indian Liberals digital archive project, and will be placed at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library for public engagement, and will soon be available on the open Indian Liberal website for visitors. According to Rajaji, a liberal democracy rests on four pillars, or feet: an active citizenry, prudent statesmen, a responsible parliament, and independent judiciary. The party was Rajaji’s response to the rise of what he saw as the ‘one-footed’ democracy—a monolithic Congress system, which had erupted due to the absence of a sustained and principled opposition, and a fractured electoral system which rewarded expensive campaigns mounted by those in power with subsequent victories. Rajaji’s greatest concern was the rise of majoritarianism, which he felt was eroding the democratic nature of our public institutions. Congress’ eclipsing victories at national and state level in the 1950s, the abuse of ordinances by the Nehru Government in the early 1950s as a means to subvert scrutiny by both houses, the misuse of Ninth Schedule to overcome judicial review, and the increase in instances of agitation and boycott by Parliamentarians troubled Rajaji, for they threatened to erode the sanctity of institutional procedures. Writing on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 1963, he argued “democracy in a pluralist society is sustained not by force of numbers but by the vital force of trust, the maintenance of which must, therefore be the greatest concern of statesmen guiding democracies.” No less than a year old, it commanded the presence of many of India’s greatest statesmen and thinkers. M R Masani, Dahyabhai Patel (son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Sir Homi Mody, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, VP Menon, Maridas Ruthnaswamy, N G Ranga, and more. The party boasted of a wide and diverse leadership, bringing together voices from the South as well as Northern India, peasant and agrarian activists and aristocrats on one platform. The party had offices and regional centres in Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Patna, with units in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It was the only national party to not have an office in Delhi, and this was done to ensure candidates and party leaders stayed close to their respective constituencies. The party also held one of the few female members of royal families to participate in electoral politics: Maharani Gayatri Devi, who campaigned relentlessly for the party in the 1962 elections. While the party performed well in the general elections of 1962 and 1967, it could not withstand the rising forces of extremism and majoritarianism in the 1970s, and floundered after Rajaji’s demise in 1974 – only a few months before the imposition of Emergency.

He is the son of Jaswant Singh, a tall Rajpur leader who, despite being one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was denied a ticket to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This battle for Manvendra is a personal one that he did not want to fight in the first place. Vasundhara Raje has been winning from this seat for three consecutive terms, and the margin she is winning by has also steadily increased from 27,000 in 2003 to 61,000 votes in 2013. What do you think will work in your favour? I think every election is a different situation. Particularly in 2018, where the politics of Rajasthan has taken a huge turn. There is an underswell against a particular kind of governance, which is palpable under the surface across the state. Coming here, I feel the underswell is also covered with a huge campaign against tyranny. All polls have predicted a Congress win in the state, sir. You are Jaswant Singh’s son, you have won before, you are politically relevant in Mewar. So, would it have been better for you to stand from Barmer as opposed to here, where you are contesting against somebody who has  a political legacy here for 30-35 years, and has been an MLA here for three consecutive terms? Certainly it would have been better to stand from the Barmer-Jodhpur side, but that is if I wanted to contest and I did not want to contest. So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didn’t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, “Make an offer I cannot refuse.” So yeah, they made an offer I couldn’t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But don’t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I don’t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised they’ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. I’ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasn’t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? I’m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you can’t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didn’t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her – your wife, Chitra Singh – of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I don’t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

But just a few months ago, Michel had reportedly gone missing. Michel’s lawyer, Amal Alsubei had told   that Michel had gone missing from the day UAE went to the court. Alsubei also added that the middleman in the Rs 3,600 crore deal will be arrested when found, and that he is likely to appeal in Supreme Court. According to the reports, on 26 August, UAE had asked a court on the possibility of extraditing a British national, not specifically Michel, to a third country,   reported. The reports of Michel going missing came a day after reports of a UAE court ordering extradition of the middleman to India surfaced. Michel was arrested in the UAE in 2017 and was out on bail then. At the time of the Rs 3,600-crore scam (early 2013), Christian Michel was a well-known British consultant who was very active in the Indian defence sector. It was alleged that he was hired by AgustaWestland to facilitate the deal for the supply of 12 helicopters to India in 2010. Michel is one of the three middlemen being probed in the case, besides Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, by the ED and CBI. The ED had also brought on the record that the three middlemen \"managed to\" make inroads into the Indian Air Force (IAF) to influence the stand of officials to reduce the service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres in 2005, according to PTI. AgustaWestland became eligible to supply the dozen helicopters for VVIP flying duties after this change. Moreover, according to ED investigation, remittances made by Michel through his Dubai-based firm Global Services to a media firm he floated in Delhi, along with two Indians, were made from the funds which he got from AgustaWestland through “criminal activity” and corruption being done in the chopper deal, reported PTI. In July 2018, after he was granted bail in Dubai, Michel had accused Indian investigators of pressuring him to name UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and frame senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in return for a clean chit in the multi-crore scam. On 19 July, while he was in custody, his lawyer Rosemary Patrizi had made similar charges against the Indian probe agencies, although CBI had denied the allegations.

As ruling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is busy promising welfare schemes to farmers, he has competition brewing in the opposition camp. Congress leader Uttam Kumar Reddy has filed his nomination in his home ground, the Huzurnagar constituency, and many say he could be the chief ministerial candidate floated by the grand alliance. The rally saw hundreds of people dancing, flags waving, loud sloganeering and   (folk dance). caught up with the Congress leader to find out how he plans to defeat the KCR government this time. In a candid conversation, Reddy said that he hopes their party doesn’t repeat any of these mistakes. “This time, we have been far more careful and hopefully those mistakes won't be repeated. I am fairly sure that the people's front we have formed now – Congress-TDP-CPM-TJS – we will win the elections with an overwhelming majority,” said Reddy. He criticised the ruling government for failing farmers, youth and women. “He promised something and didn’t do it. He looted the state. He has been an oppressive dictator, trying to suppress people's rights. I think he has been exposed now,” he added. He alleged that the chief minister’s move to dissolve the Telangana Assembly was a conspiracy. On 6 September 2018, KCR recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for early elections. He had said that he was doing it in the interests of the state, and that he wanted to curb the state’s political fragility. However, Reddy said he suspects the early election has been a result of a conspiracy between PM Narendra Modi, the Election Commission, and KCR. He said there was no other explanation for how the schedule announced by KCR was exactly the same as what was announced by the Election Commission. Reddy was a former fighter pilot and served as the Comptroller of Security, Protocol, Administration, Foreign Trips of the President at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. He is a four-time MLA and a former minister of Housing. Reddy said his agenda, if elected to power, would be to introduce farm loan waivers, unemployment toll, financial incentives to women’s self-help groups, and remunerative prices for farmers to purchase crops. If Congress wins, Reddy could become the chief minister – but when asked, he chooses to leave it to Rahul Gandhi. “I have no such ambitions.

Tasked with guarding borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, the force has a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of nation. 53 years ago, policy makers conceived of a force capable of guarding borders during peace, and to assist the army as the first line of defence during hostilities, because of the inability of the disparate State Armed Forces to stand up to even minor threats from Pakistani forces, and lack of uniformity in dealing with its counterparts. The force has grown from about 25,000 in 1965, to about 2.5 lakhs now. This mammoth growth has been in spurts, causing many problems of human resource management. The policy planners erred in ensuring a smooth phased expansion to prevent the personnel management dilemma that the force is now faced with. However, the one-time benefits of such rapid expansion has reached its saturation point, and the personnel are now stagnating for long periods, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralisation. A  takes anything from 20 to 24 years to earn his first promotion. The situation of the cadre officers of the force has always been precarious, with most of them retiring at the middle rungs. Efforts to address the problem of stagnation have lacked vision, and amounted only to fire fighting. For example, in order to bring parity with the police, the ranks of Lance Naik were abolished, thus disturbing the rank structure of a “section” which is the basic sub-unit. Similarly, the introduction of the rank of assistant sub inspector has disturbed the structure of “platoon”. The cadre review exercise for officers has, without aiming for long-term solutions, resulted only in one-time postponement of stagnation through proliferation of ranks in the battalions. Avenues created at higher levels do not accrue to cadre officers because of the rule position, and these have been usurped by IPS officers. He frequently encounters life-threatening situations, but is now not entitled to pension which his counterpart in defence forces get. Large numbers of BSF units are deployed on the Line of Control, and perform the same duties as the Army. Yet, he gets almost 25 percent less than his Army counterpart. Further, in case of an unfortunate death in the line of duty, the family of a deceased BSF soldier is deprived of many benefits available to the family of an Army Jawan, because there is no provision for a BSF soldier to be declared a martyr. BSF personnel spend most of their life on BOPs where the extended duty hours – sometimes 16 per day, enable only an interrupted sleep. To make matters worse, the living conditions at most of the BOPs are unsatisfactory. A recent report stated that out of the 66 BOPs in Barmer sector of BSF, only two had facilities for piped drinking water. The rest depended upon water tankers. The above conditions coupled with the inability to meet urgent family obligations, cause a lot of stress, resulting in a high rate of attrition. As per a reply to a parliament question, 11,192 BSF personnel have either resigned or proceeded on voluntary retirement from 2015 up-to Jan 2018. The prevalent security environment now – both internal and external – is vastly different from that in 1965. The proxy war by Pakistan has kept our western borders troubled, requiring aggressive border management practices. The Bangladesh border grapples with a threat of a different kind, with armed cattle smugglers attacking BSF soldiers, when intercepted. Heavy population density, lack of development and employment opportunities makes these borders highly crime prone. The BSF is thus faced with the policy dilemma of averting use of force to conform to the national objective of maintaining good relations with Bangladesh, and ensuring the safety and security of soldiers, while preventing crime. Man-power intensive border guarding practices are no longer adequate, and suitable technology has to be introduced to assist border men. Technological interventions in the shape of first and second generation NVDs have had a rather limited effect, and the situation on ground remains unchanged. These devices, besides having out lived their life, are cumbersome and  user-friendly. The organisation also has not invested in familiarizing troops with the usage of these devices, which is another reason for reluctance on the part of troops to use them. The technology sought to be introduced is generally vendor-driven, which more often than not, fails on ground. Trials must be carried out over an extended period in operational conditions before induction. Aspects of training in their use, maintenance etc must also be built in the contract to prevent long turn over time for repairs. Proper facilities should be created at BOPs to derive optimum advantage from devices like Thermal Imagers. Annual competition to encourage innovation remains just an event, and none of the projects have been taken up for large scale production to ease the burden on troops. The mindset of the commanders therefore, requires a generational change, as the constabulary now is educated and well-informed. To be able to adopt “smart border management” practices they should be encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and adequate training in use of technical gadgets introduced in the force. The training philosophy also needs to orient itself with the present day operational environment. While western borders need aggressive domination and “Ek goli ek dushman” type of training is still relevant, the eastern borders require troops to exercise restraint. This must therefore be incorporated in the basic induction training, and also when troops get deployed in those areas. Frequent deployment in counter-insurgency operations also necessitates incorporation of these aspects in the training. As mentioned above, border guarding is rapidly transforming into integrated border management where several agencies are equal stake holders. Borders will, in the near future, transform from barriers to bridges between nations. A smart border man therefore has to be aware of the developing scenario and understand the functioning of different agencies involved with the functioning of “integrated check posts” and “land custom stations” to facilitate the hassle-free movement of personnel and goods across the borders. Trained in policing duties, they are unable to come to grips with the complexities a large organisation like the BSF, and the dynamics of border management. The government has to give a serious thought and rectify this anomalous situation by handing over the baton to cadre officers, who, over the years, have acquired enough experience and maturity to take up the responsibility.

On Monday, 26 November, Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone at the Indian side at Dera Baba Nanak, three kilometers from the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak spent the last 17 years of his life. If this project reaches fruition by next November, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, it could mark a seachange in relations between arch rivals India and Pakistan. It could also set a precedent for the role religion can play to bring peace among erstwhile enemy nations and become a clarion call for peace in South Asia. Perhaps the most common critique of all religions is Karl Marx's phrase: opiate of the masses. The fact is that this phrase follows a longer sentence in which Marx describes the value of religion in human society. “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opiate of the people.” Since Marx’s utterance, while bashing religion, we often forget the value of religion and pick only its negative consequences. There are good reasons for it. There are umpteen examples of how communalism spreads, how politicians use religion to divide society, how competitive one-upmanship leads to violence, pogroms, riots and sectarianism. The Partition of India and Pakistan is considered the greatest exile in human history. It caused one million deaths and 14 million displacements. Ordinary people turned looters and plunderers. Even neighbours turned against each other – all in the name of religion. For the Hindu and Muslim populations, the Partition caused loss of a sense of belonging to their birth and natural environments and devastated their economies. For the Sikhs, who opposed Partition, the event also caused separation from some of their most significant religious places, including the place of birth and passing away of their founder, Guru Nanak. The Sikhs prayers include the  performed in the presence of the  or for various small and big ceremonies. The  has three parts. The first and third part are fixed but the second part can be changed to suit the occasion. After 1947, the Sikhs included the following text in the second part of their  : “ ” entres of religion, from which we have been separated.” For 71 years now, in spite of how New Delhi and Islamabad define the relationship between India and Pakistan, the Sikhs have been making the prayer to unite with their Gurdwaras. The developments this week seemed impossible just three months ago when Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan and hugged their Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had proposed the corridor. The nationalist television studios, ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), called him a ‘traitor’. Sidhu was abused and mocked. Today, the same Indian government is supporting the corridor. The BJP, which has made ‘hate Pakistan’ its major agenda, would have never agreed for such a project, but came in to glorify its beleaguered alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal. The cynical propaganda against the corridor shows how far the national narrative is from both east and west Punjab whose people share language, culture, deep bonds and have always aspired for peace. The national discourse does not get a simple fact: when two Punjabis meet, they hug as a way of greeting each other. It does not get it that former cricket stalwarts Imran Khan and Navjot Sidhu seek to re-write history. Guru Nanak says: “ ” “If you yearn to play love/enter with your head on your palm.” It is that moment for India and Pakistan. The call is whether we – both nations – want to play love, in this context with our neighbour. To fall apart, the proposal just needs: The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was freely accessible until the 1960s. In the early 2000s, Pakistan made an attempt to open access, but was thwarted by the Indian government. The SAD was in power, and SGPC was in control. That is why, since then, people have been having the   through binoculars at the Border Security Force post at Dera Baba Nanak. It is set to change now. If this project succeeds, it may lead to access to other 194 Gurdwaras included in the Sikh Ardas. It may lead to better trade and cultural ties between the two Punjabs and nations. Most of all, it would lead to demilitarisation of two poverty-stricken nations and better spending on education, health-care and employment. Certainly those are what people of both nations seek from their governments. It is a razor’s edge. As we say in Punjab:      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Well-informed sources say there has been much criticism within the government, even at the highest level, of the way things have been handled. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and some in the national security establishment are said to be most displeased. Governor Satya Pal Malik, who is in the eye of the storm, even said on Wednesday, 28 November, that he might be transferred. If that indeed happens, it would be the result of his frequent public statements. Malik’s stating that the Centre wanted him to install Sajjad Lone as the chief minister, has been damaging to both Lone and those in charge at the Centre. Associates of Lone, whose People’s Conference party has two MLAs in the house, have even said that this could get him killed. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is the putative strategist who seems to have miscalculated. It was his plan that there should be a period of governor’s rule in J&K, during which the state’s administration should be cleaned up, and then a government of his choice would be installed. Amid the heartburn and criticism within the government over the past few days, top leaders have apparently made it clear that they were not party to some of the more sordid aspects of what has transpired. For instance, Mufti has alleged that central agencies such as the NIA have been misused to coerce MLAs. Lone’s associates have been very hopeful that he would be installed with the support of the BJP’s 25 MLAs and breakaway groups from the PDP, the Congress, and the National Conference. Their hopes were on a roller-coaster since July, but remained intact until last week. Their plans were overturned by the surprise move by three of the four substantial parties in the house (the other being the BJP) to form a government together. The move, which had been in the works over the previous few days, became public last Wednesday, 21 November. The house was dissolved that evening. Given the unseemly haste, it is unlikely that anyone focussed on the fact that the proposed alliance of three major parties would have been just short of two-thirds majority in the house. But the fact is that, with the help of a couple of single members, they could have attempted to amend the state’s constitution. On the other hand, the claim by the three parties acting in tandem could not be faulted. Yet, the governor initially described it as an ‘unholy alliance’. Pointing out that no formal claim had reached him, he asserted that he had played fair by not inviting either group. The three parties had come together after initial discussions at a meeting in London. The idea gathered steam even though NC leader Omar Abdullah was initially unhappy. Naturally! His party is set to gain from the general disappointment with the PDP’s governance in Kashmir. No wonder Omar has called for fresh elections since the day the BJP withdrew support to the PDP-led government in July.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The protest, which will go on for two weeks will see party members from each of the 14 districts coming to the Secretariat to protest each day. Some of the demands that BJP will be putting forth during the protest will include lifting of restrictions in Sabarimala and strict action against the police officers for allegedly foisting false case on K Surendran, the general secretary of the party. The BJP state president said that the decision to shift the protest from Sabarimala to the Secretariat comes after women between ages 10 and 50 have stopped attempting to enter the shrine. “Only if women between these ages try to enter the temple, will we begin protesting at Sabarimala again.

Is this a mere coincidence or there is something else going on here? Here’s a little philosophy around electoral bonds: On 1 February 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley declared that the donations received by political parties henceforth will not be in cash, but in the form of electoral bonds. However, the details of the donor and the receiver of this bond will be confidential. It's commonly believed that the party predicted to win the elections receives the maximum funds, in anticipation of the benefits that will accrue once the party gains power. This is the very basis of the corruption that takes place in government. An   by  ’s Poonam Agarwal revealed that electoral bonds have a hidden alphanumeric code printed on them to track down the link between donors and political parties. This apparent manoeuvring by the government poses a critical question – in the name of increased ‘transparency’ in political funding with the introduction of electoral bonds, are we being subjected to unprecedented levels of secret surveillance? Electoral bonds were promised to be anonymous as no one other than the donors themselves are supposed to know which political party they are contributing to. ’s investigation reveals that while the public will remain clueless about who has donated to which party, the government has access to those details, collated through alphanumeric codes on the electoral bonds, which are invisible to the naked eye.

Talking to PTI while campaigning in the rural areas of Tonk, Khan said the decision to field him was based on strategy and equations, and not on his religion. Asked about being the lone Muslim candidate of the BJP and if his nomination marked a departure from the party's strategy to not field any candidates from the minority community, he said: \"I don't know about elsewhere, but in Rajasthan, Yoonus Khan and (late BJP leader) Ramzan Khan have been fighting polls since the 80s.\" Khan said he has been the party's lone Muslim candidate once earlier also.

I have given my vision... As a minister I connected Sawai Madhopur road to a two-lane road. I have given a bypass.”, he said. He also vowed to solve the problem of drinking water faced by the residents of Tonk.

An FIR was registered by Noida Police on 22 October on the complaint of data theft and extortion by the owner of PayTm, Vijay Shekhar Sharma and his brother Ajay Shekhar Sharma. It alleged that four people tried to extort Rs 10 crore from Paytm’s owner against the stolen data. The alleged blackmailers also threatened to make the data public and defame Vijay Shekhar Sharma if ransom was not paid. The FIR named four persons as accused – Sonia Dhawan, an employee of Paytm and personal secretary of Vijay; Roopak Jain, Sonia’s husband; Devinder Kumar, Paytm employee; and Rohit Chomwal, a businessman from Kolkata. The FIR doesn’t reveal the nature of the data stolen nor has Sharma commented on the nature the data. A lot of assumptions and speculation came out in the media that the data could be related to Paytm users’ personal details, which could be misused or sold by the alleged blackmailers.  has finally got answers to what is in the stolen data. Dr Ajay Pal Sharma, Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar district has confirmed to  that the stolen data is related to Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s personal life. A reliable source has confirmed that the personal data was allegedly stolen by Devindra Kumar, one of the accused in the case. Noida Police has claimed that a CD was recovered from one of the accused which allegedly contains stolen data. The CD has been sent for Forensic examination. The FIR accessed by  reveals that Chomwal was a key player. He was directly communicating with Vijay and Ajay through WhatsApp calls and messages. The FIR says, It was he who demanded Rs 10 crore as ransom and also informed the complainants about his other accomplices. Sonia’s lawyer refused to divulge the details of the data as the matter is subjudice. A small part of the ransom money was transferred into Chomwal’s bank account in two tranches, Rs 67 and Rs 2 lakhs, on 10 and 15 October, respectively. Interestingly, the key player, Chomwal, is still at large and he has not been questioned by the police even once. Meanwhile, Sonia, Roopak and Devinder were arrested and are still in jail. Sonia’s bail application will come up for hearing on 4 December. In November 2018, Chomwal moved an application in the Allahabad High Court which gave him protection from being arrested till the investigation is completed. The   in   possession alleges that Chomwal has been wrongly accused in the case and has been made an “escape goat” (sic) especially when the petitioner (ie: Chomwal) helped Vijay Shekhar and his brother in apprehending the three ‘culprits’. The police has not clarified what evidence they have against Sonia, Roopak and Devinder to prove their involvement in the case. Is Chomwal so foolish that he will agree on the transfer of the ransom money to his bank account which can act as an evidence against him in the court? The FIR reveals that the first ransom call was made by Chomwal on 20 September but the complaint was filed on 22 October. Why did the complainant wait for 32 days to file a complaint? Why did Vijay and his brother transfer Rs 2 lakh to Chomwal’s bank account and then file a complaint? Was it to create evidence? Well, the FIR says that they already had Chomwal’s WhatsApp calls and messages as evidence. Sonia’s lawyer said that she was regularly attending office between 20 September and 22 October, during the period when Chomwal was blackmailing Vijay. Her lawyer claimed that there would be enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage to prove her presence in the office. The question then is – why was she allowed to come to office when Vijay knew that she was one of the persons blackmailing him? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

There has never been an urgent need to address this crisis more than now, and the hundreds of country’s farmers want the parliamentarians to listen, he points out. Sainath, a renowned journalist known for his ground reports that focus on the plight of the farmers, has been participating in protest marches organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). “The message behind this march is that people expect Parliament to work for the people and not just for the corporate world. When a special session of Parliament can be called for the rollout of GST, with virtually no notice, then why can’t one be called for the farmers’ issues,” he asks. He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 – and the last in 2006 – which means that “in 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.” We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. “Senseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,” Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers – both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously “the middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.” “Be it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,” he says. Sainath has been mobilising support for the farmers' march to Delhi, which has been organised in collaboration with over 200 farmers’ outfits.

Data from the   submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission of India (ECI) further substantiates this assumption. BJP was the beneficiary of 95 percent of the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. The electoral bonds scheme was notified in January 2018. March 2018 was the   when these bonds were available for purchase from four different branches of SBI (Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai & New Delhi).  using the Right to Information (RTI) revealed that a total of 520 electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were purchased in March 2018. Hence in the year 2017-18, these were the only bonds that were purchased. Most bonds (in terms of number) were purchased in Kolkata where 212 bonds were purchased. In terms of value, most bonds (worth Rs 122 crore) were purchased in Mumbai. As per the   submitted by the BJP to the ECI, the party received Rs 210 crore worth contribution in the form of electoral bonds.  This is a whopping 95 percent of all the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. Since the design of the scheme does not allow for the disclosure of names of the contributors, it is impossible to find out who contributed these Rs 210 crore to the BJP. Out of the total voluntary contribution of Rs 989.7 crore received by the BJP in 2017-18, more than 21 percent or Rs 210 crore is through electoral bonds. Even in terms of the total income of the BJP in 2017-18, more than 20 percent is through electoral bonds. 45 percent of BJP’s income in 2016-17 was from unknown sources as per  .

It also has to be noted that the Congress and NCP are the only two national parties that are yet to submit their annual audit report for 2017-18. It is possible that the rest of Rs 12 crore worth electoral bonds have gone to either the Congress or NCP or other state parties. It is also possible that a large part of these electoral bonds may not have gone to any party since   using RTI also revealed that bonds worth Rs 11 crore were not encashed by July 2018.  purchased in all the cycles till October 2018 clearly indicates that there is no demand for bonds of lower denomination. In terms of value, bonds of Rs 1 crore denomination accounted for Rs 782 crore or 89.6 percent followed by bonds of Rs 10 lakh denomination that accounted for Rs 89.6 crore or 10.3 percent. Together, they have accounted for close to 99.9 percent of total value of bonds purchased till date. Even in terms of the number of bonds purchased, 1678 out of the 1795 or 93.5 percent electoral bonds purchased till date are in the denomination of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Though there is no concrete information on the type of purchasers since SBI has refused to share such information, it is highly likely that the Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore denomination are purchased by corporates than individuals.

Chawla was a vocal propagator of ' ' that calls for the “liberation of Punjab.” Speaking to  , Security Analyst Praveen Swami said, “Chawla’s name had cropped up during the investigation of the grenade attack on the Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar, but there is no hard evidence against him.” Chawla is vocal about his pro-Khalistani stand on social media, and in a Facebook video, he can be heard saying, “Bharat is not Bharat, it has become Hindustan, which is why we need Khalistan.” He goes to praise Pakistan and raise anti-India slogans. Defending himself, Chawla told  Chawla also added that he clicked pictures with almost everybody present at the event. However, on being asked about the “terror activites” in Punjab, Chawla said, “We don’t support terror. Punjab is ours and why would we create disturbance in our own home?” On the sidelines of the ground-breaking ceremony, Chawla also met the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) President Gobind Singh Longowal. Speaking to the media, former Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab, Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “If Sidhu shakes hands with Gopal Chawla, who was involved in a terror attack in Pakistan, then he'll have to answer for it.” Badal also said that Sidhu doesn’t care about any protocol and that he should remember that the general he shook hands with “makes the youth of his country fight and die everyday.” Meanwhile, a Pakistani official clarified that the Pakistani Army Chief met all the guests at the Kartarpur ceremony venue and that the Indian media was taking a “myopic view” of the picture. The BJP, too, reacted sharply to Chawla's photo with Sidhu. Manjinder S Sirsa, General Secretary, DSGMC and Akali Dal Spokesperson, tweeted: Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had on Wednesday, 28 November, attacked Sidhu for ‘his bonhomie’ with the Pakistan Prime Minister. \"He offered to have him (Navjot Singh Sidhu) fight elections from Pakistan. Sidhu seems to have more love and respect in Pakistan than what I noticed over here. He has some good relationships over there,\" Badal told ANI. Kaur and Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri were present at the event as the Indian government’s representatives.

Singh said that Sidhu did not get back to him on the matter. Earlier in August 2018, when the Punjab Minister hugged Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa, on the sidelines of Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s swearing in, it created a furore, and the Punjab CM criticised Sidhu. The Punjab CM stated, that at a time when the Pakistan Army was killing Indian soldiers, Sidhu’s hug was uncalled for. Sidhu who left the BJP due to his strained ties with the Badal family has been far more aggressive on Sukhbir Singh Badal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, an ally of the BJP) and his brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia, a former Minister in the erstwhile SAD government. Sidhu sought the arrest of Majithia for his alleged links with drug peddlers (the Punjab minister stated that a special task force report set up by the Congress government had sufficient evidence, which pointed to Majithia’s involvement in drug peddling). The Punjab CM, who in his previous tenure went hammer and tongs against the Badals, has been less combative, with many, including his own party men, alleging that he has a tacit understanding with the Badals. Even when the Ranjit Singh Commission report (set up by Captain Amarinder Singh to investigate the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, as well as the death of two peaceful protesters who died as a result of police firing) was tabled in the Punjab assembly, Sidhu took a far stronger line against the Badals, arguing that the report stated that the former CM Parkash Singh Badal had issued firing orders. Captain Amarinder is being hailed for his decision to decline the Pakistani invitation for attending the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Sahib. Captain Singh has cited terrorism emanating from Pakistan, as well as the role of the Pakistani Army in the same as the reason for his decision. Elahi’s family is known for his proximity to the Pakistan Army as well as the ISI. Captain Singh visited Pakistan in 2005 and held the all Punjab games in December 2004. Significantly, during the 1980’s, the Elahi’s had links with a number of Khalistani activists and some analysts had criticised Captain Singh for going overboard in his outreach to Pakistani Punjab inspite of the above factors. Captain Amarinder Singh during his Pakistan visits has also cultivated strong personal friendships with individuals known to have close links with the Pakistani ‘Deep State’. The reasons for Captain Amarinder Singh’s decision to decline the Pakistani invitation thus are not driven solely by any principles or conviction. While Captain Singh’s decision and aggressive statements do no harm to burnish his nationalist credentials and his tough stance when it comes to national security, it is a bit naive to overlook other factors for Singh’s latest moves. One important factor could be that Navjot Singh Sidhu has stolen the limelight in the context of the Kartarpur issue.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals – why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of ‘tribal tourism’ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own ‘Ongan’ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an “Andaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute – ANTRI” in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to “hands off” to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed ‘Restricted Area Permit’ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands which  are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyone’s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

This is a curious call to action because, hopefully, the BJP and RSS know that no law can bypass the Constitution or judicial challenges in courts. And this law in particular – assuming the ruling party will have it passed in both houses of the Parliament – will most certainly be challenged in the Supreme Court. Unless the government seeks to build religious centres for all communities –which, given the political and ideological proclivities of the ruling dispensation, is unimaginable – the law to not only acquire the disputed land for a temple, but also to build it, would run into the headwinds of the constitutional guarantee of  . Gandhi and Sardar Patel supported the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, but not by the government and not by using state funds, despite the fact that the Somnath temple was not disputed in the way the Ram temple is. Secularism of the Indian state approximates more to proximity to all religions, rather than equal distance from all. The state is involved with a number of existing religious practices and institutions, but to pass a law that not only favours the faith of one community over another, but also legitimises retrospectively the assault committed on the faith of a minority community by the destruction of the Babri Masjid, would be to go too far beyond any possible definition of a secular state. We have been here before. The last time the government sought to acquire the land to settle the dispute between territories through the Acquisition of Central Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993, it took the matter (itself) to the Supreme Court in a reference, and declared before it, that it was committed “to the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque”, without specifying exact locations. The matter, at the heart of it, is a land dispute – a fact that is easy to forget in the political and ideological heat that surrounds it. (It is pertinent to remember that what was destroyed on 6 December 1992 was not only the Babri Masjid, but also the Ram Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi, whose existence is historically parallel to the Babri Mosque.) In  , the Supreme Court struck down the aforementioned 1993 Act saying that it was unconstitutional, as it overrode the property rights of the Muslim litigants, acquired according to the latter’s pleadings, through the simple fact that the Babri Masjid had stood on the disputed land at least since the 16th century. In addition, the government would also have to demonstrate that any such acquisition is in public interest – not an easy task, given that acquiring the land to build a Ram temple would favour one religion over another. If the government were to pass another such Act (this time with no proposal to build a mosque, presumably) it will also have to contend with the Places of Worship Act (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of any place of worship, including of course a mosque, as it existed on independence – a fairly fundamental safeguard for a secular state. Until that date, around when Muslims were forcibly stopped from using the mosque, Babri Masjid was a place of worship for the latter, barring the Ram Chabutra, which of course was a Hindu place of worship. It  also easy to forget that there is a criminal case winding its way through the judicial system given that it has been progressing at a pace that would put glaciers to shame. A law of the nature demanded by senior RSS leaders would only further abuse that the trust, and provide state approval and sanction to the demolition. If it comes into force, then the Supreme Court will have to answer if a criminal act can create property and other rights. Given the context, and our institutional and constitutional structure, it is baffling that the RSS is pushing the government to come up with a law to bypass the judiciary. The worst they can do is to keep mounting all kinds of pressure on the judiciary – including, for instance, the sort of vitriolic and personalised attack that Indresh Kumar launched on ‘2-3’ judges in a speech that he delivered on 27 November – and hope that the courts will buckle under pressure. But they cannot stop the law they are demanding from being brought to the courts, and challenged. Further delay means that the issue will remain emotive and eminently exploitable for elections to come but if the RSS’s real intent is to see a Ram temple built on the disputed land, a law passed by the government cannot help them bypass the judiciary. The only way to bypass the judiciary at first pass is to build the temple illegally, and the only way to bypass it altogether, is to change the Constitution to suit their end goal.

I donated it to those families of the farmers that committed suicide. While that went on for a number of years, I realised that the number of people I was benefitting was very small in proportion to the amount of distress there was. So I felt like, why not start a political movement! Something on a larger scale. Now, with the help of the district administration in UP, we identified such farmers and started crowd-funding in those areas. We worked with around 4,300 farmers across districts like Allahabad, Balrampur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur-Khiri. We were very particular about keeping the rate of recidivism low. It should not be like that a person takes the money, reduces or eliminates his debt, and goes on to spend it on his daughter’s marriage and gets back into debt again. This movement gave me a sense that we could see things to their logical conclusion. But again, this scale was very small. I realised that to effect a social transformation, we need to change things at the policy level because that’s the only way things are going to be systemically solved. That’s when I started working on this book. This book has taken me to 11 states, 60 districts to talk about things like water, labour, textile, energy access, agricultural marketing etc.” “You always find a very urban bias towards the fact that the farmer loan waivers have been given. If you look at total farm loan waivers in the country versus industry subsidies, the total farm loan waivers today are exactly 3.6% of the industry subsidies. When we are talking about people who are 70% of the total population, just 3.6%! So exactly which sops are we talking about? The conversation on agriculture these days is almost as if we are doing the farmers a favour, which is completely the other way round. A farmer doing a hectare of paddy or wheat farming earns about Rs 2,500-2,800 per month from that. An agricultural labourer earns about 5000 rupees a month. So a farmer is doing worse than the labour working on his field. How can it be sustainable? No wonder 30 million people in the last five years have left agriculture. 50 million people before that in the last ten years. That’s a lot of people. If it continues down this road, our food security will be threatened. My point is not simply about agriculture. My study is an academic critique of how the village as an economic unit can be viable a 100 years from now. Because if the village doesn’t remain viable then frankly India as a country is going to collapse. The cities cannot bear the burden of internal migration. We need to look at non-farm income, we need to look at textile, handicrafts. India has over 300 handicraft clusters. Why are we not ramping those up? In India one sustainable job in steel costs 24 lakh rupees; 24 jobs are created in textile for 1 lakh rupees. As a country, which one should we be looking at? We have an army of unemployed people, what are we doing?” “When Bombay Presidency was created, the British focused on irrigation in the southern Bombay Presidency, which is the present day Gujarat, and in western Maharashtra of today. But they did very little in what is now Vidarbha because it was largely seen as jungle. Now look at the consequence of something as basic as irrigation. The farmers of Vidarbha have 4% irrigation and they have been reduced to total pauperisation and this region sees the largest rate of farmer suicides in the country. The problems are there but the solutions are not terribly difficult.” “It’s not about the government only. It’s also about the channels in the middle. There is a historical study done in 1972 in then Calcutta, which said that just 2% of the end-user price of an orange reached the farmer because the marketing channels had consumed the majority of the value. Just look at our APMCs, the mandis. Unpaved roads, open spaces. Even today there are no storage facilities, there is no cover. A lot of stuff gets rotten. When you go there it’s almost like a mafia is running it. The farmers are at their mercy. The farmer goes there from his village 7-8 km away in a tractor trolley. Sometimes he stays there for 3-4 days awaiting good price. And then in desperation he sells at whatever price. Even if we do nothing else and just fix the mandis in our country that itself will alleviate and mitigate a lot of farmer distress. “These are very good solutions. Communication and information revolution will help the farmer. The point is, however, how many farmers have the smartphone? Even if they have smartphones they have cheap ones that don’t have enough battery power to run them. The electricity situation is not the best so their phones are not charged half the time. One of the projects that I undertook in Banda was with a group that was doing a lot of great work with information disseminated from Mandya in Karnataka via the mobile. Initially we took 4 villages in Banda and we started sharing this with them and we found that they were resistant. They said, “ ” But when I visited again after three months they were literally looking at their phones for one hour a day to educate themselves. Digital solutions will certainly work but please remember that in India we have gone from medievalism to post-modernism in a record period of time. So, we are living in, simultaneously, two different time zones.” “When talking about dairy, my mother takes the animal rights approach and I see it from purely economic perspective. Now a person engaged in dairy farming will eventually take the animal to the slaughterhouse after its milch phase is over because they can’t afford to keep them. What we need to look at is different systems to keep those creatures relevant for the farmer. In India, we have a desperate need for energy. When LPG cylinders—which are made from crude oil—spike in price they become unaffordable for the last man in society. So, if we can look at gobar gas plants many of our issues are solved. A bovine creature gives about 30-40 kgs of gobar everyday.

These were the words of the   when he promised to personally lead the global body towards greater gender equality. As the world observes the start of ‘16 Days of Activism’ against gender-based violence (from 26 November 2018), an independent United Nations system-wide survey on sexual harassment is taking place around all UN country offices. It is the first of its kind, and it demonstrates the UN’s resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all personnel across its offices. The UN initiative is in lock-step with the theme for this year’s ‘16 Days of Activism’ – ‘Orange the World; Hear Me Too’. The aim is to raise awareness about violence against women and its impact on a woman’s physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The #MeToo movement heralded the coming out of women across various professions and work forces, against their (primarily) male perpetrators, breaking a decades-old silence that they were previously compelled to live with. Statistics indicate that more than one in three women across the world have experienced physical or sexual violence, usually perpetrated by an intimate partner. In a   by Edison Research and Marketplace on sexual harassment, 27 percent of women and 14 percent of men reported that they had been harassed at some time at their workplace. Despite the progressive policy commitments and institutional frameworks on gender equality and women empowerment, implementation remains slow and inconsistent. While the   campaign has gained high momentum since its launch in September 2014, a lot still needs to be done to bring men on board in addressing sexual harassment towards women in public and private spaces. Such campaigns have brought considerable gains towards raising consciousness and self-assurance for women. Increasingly, they are speaking out against the indignities of work-related sexual advances and intimidation. This is the cost that countries are paying when women and girls are denied the chance to live to their full social and economic potential. Consider the aspect of employment: according to a World Bank   released this year, countries are losing USD 160 trillion in wealth because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men. This amounts to an average of USD 23,620 for each person. In India, reports indicate that every 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of domestic violence. In a country where physical and psychological abuse is all pervasive and rampant, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has done little to alleviate gender-based discrimination and violence. The Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office that has more than 10 employees of any gender. However, a   done some years back found that 7 in 10 working women did not report workplace harassment, demonstrating a disturbing lack of confidence in the system. By one  , gender inequality may have reduced India’s economic growth by almost 4 percent annually over the past 10 years. . It is estimated that 27 percent of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. It is said that the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25 percent increase in wages. In addition, ensuring that all girls get at least secondary education in India, would reduce child marriages by more than half. All these demonstrate the cyclical benefits, from one generation to the next, of education as an intervention strategy. However, while evidence abounds that parity with women is the best driving force for economic growth, wealth creation and poverty eradication, women’s rights are being “reduced, restricted and reversed”, according to UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres. There cannot be any illusions about the enormity of the task ahead. Misogyny is a deep-rooted expression of male entitlement that often excuses sexual harassment and violence, even at times by the survivors themselves. Women shouldn't have to feel 'grateful' for opportunities, says the UN DSG Amina Mohammed in a  . So true. Ultimately, countries need to begin breaking structural barriers, not just with gender equality as a lofty ideal but as a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. ’s (What does the first-time woman voter want?

This came a day after Chandramukhi’s mother, Anitha Muvvala, represented by lawyer Vasudha Nagraj, filed a habeas corpus writ petition in the Hyderabad High Court. Admitting the petition, the court had asked the Jubilee Hills police to produce Chandramukhi before them by 10:15 am on Thursday. Chandramukhi had reportedly been missing since 8:25 am on Tuesday, 27 November; based on the missing person's complaint, an FIR has been filed. The police said that they are reviewing CCTV footage. According to sources, Chandramukhi turned up at the Banjara Hills police station along with her lawyer and some activists late on Wednesday night. Speaking to TNM, Anitha confirmed that Chandramukhi had been found and was doing okay. She is expected to be produced at the court at 10 am. \"She has come back. She was abducted by someone and intimidated severely, she's dazed and disoriented. She'll share what happened to her before the court,\" Vasudha Nagaraj, her lawyer, told TNM. “She was noticed missing since 8:25 am and the door of her house is locked from the outside,” the Banjara Hills SHO said. Chandramukhi, a well-known face in Hyderabad’s trans community, is contesting from the Goshamahal constituency in Hyderabad on a Bahujan Left Front (BLF) ticket. She will be taking on bigwigs such as the BJP’s Raja Singh and the Congress’ Mukesh Goud. Vinu, who is tasked with the campaign schedule, told the press that Chandramukhi would inform him where she was going, and who she is meeting. “We approached the police only at 2:30 pm. We waited, hoping she would come back by then,” he said. Vinu also alleged that a person who was found lurking around her house in the CCTV footage could be involved in her disappearance.

Hluna also flagged BJP's 'Hindutva' image as a big liability. In a candid interview with  , which was published on the day the state went to polls, on Wednesday, 28 November, Hluna said that from Modi to Shah, no national BJP leader had put in the slightest effort in the pre-election campaign. He also said that they didn’t give the state enough importance. Adding to this, he said, the biggest problem the party faced in the state, was carrying the tag of  . According to Hluna, people in Mizoram – a predominantly Christian state – have in the past opposed the BJP, as they believe that the party would persecute Christians, should they be voted to power, the  report read. Despite this, Hluna told the news agency that he was fairly confident of the BJP bagging the highest number of seats in the Assembly elections, voting for which began on Wednesday, 28 November. He said the people wanted change and development, which the BJP could give them, the report added. Hluna told the news agency that he didn’t think that Modi, Shah and the party’s other central leaders had made enough of an effort for the pre-election campaign in Mizoram, as they had only sent one lawmaker and not visited any constituency themselves. He further said that since Hindi or English isn’t the first language of the Mizo people, the party’s central leadership did not have that much effect on them. Another point he brought up, was the lack of funds and lack of power that the state party was being given by its central leadership. “They should give us more money so that we can run things on our own. But there is no money, we are very poor. If there is a lot of money, we can do well,” he told  . To Hluna, the BJP’s greatest challenge to coming into power, was being perceived as a pro-Hindutva outfit, which would persecute those belonging to the Christian faith, the report stated. However, he added that it would be a Christian BJP candidate from Mizoram, who would come to power, if the BJP won the elections. Hence, he said, this is why people shouldn’t think against voting for the BJP, the report stated. Despite his problem with the central leadership of the BJP and the party’s “Hindutva” image in the state, Hluna told  that he was fairly confident and optimistic about its win in the elections. The reason, he said, was because people were fed up with the Congress rule under Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla and that they wanted change and development- which the state party under Narendra Modi’s guidance, would be able to give them. He also said that if the Congress, MNF and other parties were unable to form the new government independently, he was confident that their lawmakers would join the BJP, which, he claimed, would win the maximum seats in the elections, the report said.

He had supported the idea of joint polls before suddenly declaring early polls in Telangana and, as recently as August 2018, KCR had sent out indications that he is even open to a possible post-poll tie up with the BJP. But there seems to be a twist in that “friendly” tale with the BJP, and in the last three days, the Telangana campaign has been dominated by an acerbic  , in an exchange of statements and allegations. Hitting back at Modi, KCR, speaking at a rally in Mahbubnagar, alleged that the prime minister was “spreading lies for votes” and even referred to him as a “foolish” prime minister. He further stated that he was “not scared” of the prime minister like his political rivals. Firstly, KCR’s principal rival in the state is the Congress party and hence it is necessary for him to have a cordial equation with the BJP. Further, Telangana as a newly-formed state is heavily dependent on the Centre and hence, he needs a good equation with the prime minister. This population is not just centred around Hyderabad city where it even has a majority in some assembly seats, but is spread across the state and can be decisive in districts like Nizamabad or even KCR’s bastion Mahbubnagar. KCR and the TRS seem to have a friendly equation with the most powerful voice of the Muslims in the state, the All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, but there is no open alliance with the MIM and there are fears that Muslim voters may alienate the TRS as it is being seen as close to the BJP. There are also serious doubts over KCR’s gamble of calling for an early election. Ground reports indicate that the Congress has regrouped itself, and the alliance it has formed with the Telugu Desam Party, Left and the Telanagana Jana Samithi has formidable arithmetic on the ground. The combined vote share of the allies was nearly 40 percent in 2014 when the TRS managed to win just over half the seats with 34 percent vote share. The political dynamics seem to lend weight to the Congress’s allegation that the rivalry between KCR and the prime minister is ostensible. However, the fact that the TRS has an alliance with the MIM, which is formidable in Hyderabad, is a headache for the Congress. TRS leaders also point out that the TDP had an open alliance with the BJP before shifting sides, and hence, the Congress’s grand alliance (Maha Kootami as it is called in Telugu) is an alliance of opportunity and not one of values. But, in all this, what’s there for the BJP? Firstly, the Bharatiya Janata Party clearly hopes for a Congress defeat in Telangana. As a party, its stakes are minimal in the assembly polls, and hence, its ideal result would be a TRS win. However, in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP desperately needs allies in the south of India, and TRS is a potential candidate. But BJP leaders insist that they want to create an independent identity in the state and the prime minister targeting KCR is a message, that the party cannot be taken lightly by regional players. Finally, the nature of the attacks the two leaders made against each other was fierce and personal, and the language suggests that it needs to be taken seriously. But then, real life politics is stranger than fiction, and the sharper an exchange, the stronger the perception of being rivals!         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Let’s do the electoral math by placing the country into four clusters: 1) north and west; 2) south; 3) east; and 4) Northeast and union territories.  This comprises 12 states (Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh). Together they offer 259 seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 205 seats out of its overall tally of 282 seats from this 12-state, 259-seat cluster. This is therefore the make-or-break cluster for the BJP. In 2019 though, it can realistically expect to win only around 150 seats from these 12 key north-western states. That’s a fall of 55 seats over 2014 due to strong anti-incumbency, the Congress’ resurgence and the   across the region. Can it make up this large decline in the other zones?  The five are unlikely to provide a cushion. The BJP won 21 out of 129 available seats in the south in 2014. Karnataka provided 17 of these. Again realistically, the BJP is unlikely to increase its tally significantly in 2019. Kerala may offer the odd extra seat. Karnataka could even slip a little, leaving the BJP with around 20 seats in the south. Together in the first two clusters, the BJP’s tally could therefore total around 170.  The four key eastern states of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand could prove crucial for the BJP. In 2014, the BJP won 37 seats in these four states from 117 seats on offer. In 2019, it will rely heavily on seat-sharing with ally JD(U) to sweep Bihar. Odisha promises a rich harvest too with dissent at the top of Naveen Patnaik’s BJD giving the BJP an opening. West Bengal remains a distant prospect though the BJP is likely to make inroads as the Left continues to lose traction. Meanwhile, with Jharkhand, where the BJP won 12 out of 14 seats in 2014, still a safe bet, the BJP could increase its tally in the 117-seat east cluster from 37 seats in 2014 to around 45 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP’s overall tally in the first three clusters rises to around 215 seats.  The   has been a special focus for the BJP. In 2014, it won just eight out of 25 seats in the seven northeastern states and Sikkim - seven of them from Assam. The BJP-backed North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) has changed the situation dramatically. The party can expect to raise its tally to around 14 seats in 2019. The seven union territories (UTs), including Delhi NCT, contributed 11 out of 13 available seats to the BJP in 2014. That total is unlikely to change much, though Delhi could swing partially towards the Congress, giving the BJP around 25 out of 38 seats on offer in the fourth cluster. Thus, the four clusters, in a best-case scenario, are likely to provide the BJP with 240 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election (150+20+45+25). Caveat: a Mayawati-Mulayam-Congress mahagathbandhan, however unlikely, could significantly reduce the BJP’s tally in Uttar Pradesh, cutting its Lok Sabha numbers to the low 220s. Unpredictable events such as a positive verdict by the Supreme Court in the Ram Mandir case and escalation of a conflict with Pakistan could in turn change the electoral math in favour of the BJP. Clearly, the BJP with 220-240 seats will not be able to form a government without the support of NDA allies. The Shiv Sena, TDP, LJP, SAD and others have varying degrees of problems with the BJP. To form a stable NDA coalition, the BJP would need at least 50 seats from its allies, taking the alliance’s tally to around 270-290. With the JD(U), but without the Shiv Sena, even that may prove difficult. The Rajinikanth factor in Tamil Nadu though could play a decisive role if he allies with the NDA, making Shiv Sena support redundant. Now turn to the Congress. To win power, Rahul Gandhi will have to rely heavily on old and new UPA allies. Across our four clusters, the Congress will be lucky to win 85-90 seats overall. To be a credible challenger to form a UPA 3 government, the Congress will need the following eleven key allies: TMC, the Left, DMK, SP, RJD, BSP, JD(S), AIMIM, NC, NCP and TRS. Defections from the NDA’s disgruntled allies would be welcome. Again, taking a best-case scenario, despite the unlikely prospect of the BSP and SP as well as the Left and TMC cohabiting in UPA 3, the 11 key allies together with smaller Congress-leaning parties are unlikely to garner more than 120 seats. Even if the Congress doubles its own tally to 90 seats, a putative UPA 3 would have only 210 Lok Sabha seats in all (90+120) - far short of a working majority. The way forward for the Congress therefore is to win at least 150 seats on its own as it did in 2004. Then only will it be able to cobble together a workable UPA 3 coalition in 2019 with over 270 seats (150 Congress plus 120 allies). In 2004, the Left with 60 seats supported the 145-seat Congress from outside. Other UPA 1 allies made up the numbers. In 2019, though relatively weakened, the BJP will still win far more than the 138 seats it won in 2004. At our estimate of 220-240 seats, the BJP can effectively thwart a potential UPA 3 - unless the Congress nearly quadruples its 2014 tally of 44 to well over 150. There just aren’t enough UPA allies to make up the slack as there were in 2004 with the Left’s 60 seats plumetting in 2014 to just nine. In 2019, the largest UPA ally will be the TMC with 30-odd seats. For the BJP, the message is clear. Five consecutive mediocre Budgets have alienated the middle class. They count for little electorally, but have a disproportionate influence on the political narrative. The BJP’s policies over the past 45 months have been a mixed bag: in sum, it has failed to deliver maximum governance and minimum government. It has less than a year to reverse the slide. The Lok Sabha election may well be advanced to December 2018 along with the key state polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in order to mask strong anti-incumbency. The BJP though does have one trump card: a still-anaemic Congress. But it can’t rely on that forever. To win re-election, the BJP will have to perform. Or perish.","date":"2018-02-07","tag":"NDA,Congress,BJP,Lok Sabha elections 2019","title":"Why Modi faces rocky road to 272 in 2019 Lok Sabha elections","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-2019-lok-sabha-elections-bjp-nda-allies-disgruntled-272-mark/story/1/22234.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15283},{"author":"Harsh V Pant","content":"Crisis in the Maldives escalated this week after President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of Emergency and asked the military troops to arrest two top judges and detain former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition. Last week the nation’s Supreme Court had ordered the release of nine imprisoned Opposition politicians on the ground that their trials were politically motivated and flawed. The government refused to implement the ruling which led to widespread demonstrations in Male and clashes between the police and protesters. Calling President Yameen’s announcement “unconstitutional and illegal”, exiled former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed, the country’s first democratically-elected leader, has urged India to “act swiftly” to resolve the crisis. In some ways, Yameen’s actions are understandable as his options after the Supreme Court ruling were limited. The court verdict not only paves the way for Nasheed to return from his exile in Colombo and run for the presidency this year but also makes Yameen’s impeachment potentially plausible. Yameen must be calculating that with help of friends of like China, he would be able to ride over the crisis that would emerge with his declaration of Emergency. The alacrity with which the Maldives embraced China seems to have caught India off guard. But New Delhi’s engagement with Male has been hesitant of late and China has made the most of it. During Yameen’s China visit last year, the two nations signed 12 pacts, including a free trade agreement. Yameen also fully endorsed China’s ambitious Maritime Silk Road initiative. President Xi Jinping declared that “China deems the Maldives as an important partner” in this initiative and Yameen repaid the favour by claiming that the Maldives viewed China “among (its) closest friends” and that “the Belt and Road Initiative has greatly helped the development of many small and medium countries”. At a time when China’s belt and road initiative is beginning to attract scrutiny around the world, with even erstwhile supporters calling for a reassessment, such an endorsement is much sought after by Beijing. The Maldives became the second country in South Asia, after Pakistan, to enter into a free trade agreement with China. The Yameen government pushed the FTA through the nation’s Parliament, the Majlis, stealthily, with the Opposition not attending the parliamentary session. The principal Opposition party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that it was “deeply concerned over sudden and rushed Free Trade Agreement with China, without any disclosure of details to the public or to the MPs”. The concerns of the Opposition centre around a possible increase in the trade deficit, already tilted in favour of China, and the strategic direction of the country. The MDP has argued that it is worried “that further entrenchment of the country into a Chinese debt trap will result in additional stress on strategic national assets and increasing instability in the Indian Ocean region”. But that is where Yameen wants to take his country, it seems. On the one hand, he has been flirting with Islamist extremism and on the other, he wants to use closer ties with China to shield his government from global criticism. After the first-ever visit by a Chinese President to the Maldives in 2014, it officially became a part of the \"21st-century Maritime Silk Road.\" China quickly expanded its economic profile in the Maldives by building mega infrastructure projects, including the development of Hulhule island and a bridge connecting it to Male as well as the country’s main international airport. A constitutional amendment allowing foreign ownership of freehold land was passed in 2015, which can potentially enhance Chinese military presence in the island nation. Already, Chinese naval ships have become regular visitors to Male. During his 2016 visit to Delhi, Yameen had said his country pursues an “India first” foreign policy, describing it as the Maldives’s most important friend. But that was just after India had shielded the Yameen government from punitive action by the Commonwealth’s human rights and democracy oversight body. New Delhi’s recent policy of engaging with the Maldivian Opposition, especially the former President, Mohammad Nasheed, may be causing heartburn in Male and so the outreach to China has intensified. The Maldives remains the only country in South Asia which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to visit. There were many in India who had been critical of the Modi government’s light touch approach vis-à-vis Yameen over the last few years as he systematically worked at destroying the foundations of democracy in his country. But New Delhi had other interests to preserve in the archipelago nation. Now the moment of reckoning has come for both New Delhi and Yameen. India’s suggestion that the Supreme Court’s ruling should be promptly implemented was clearly given a short shrift by Yameen. New Delhi will have to intervene cautiously. A coordinated response with other like-minded regional and extra-regional players will be the first step. But like in the past, New Delhi should not be shy of using coercive diplomacy if only to underscore that ignoring India’s warnings comes at a price. The logic of geography dictates that India’s role will be critical in determining the trajectory of political developments in the Maldives.

So do nations. Nothing manifested that better than the congregation of the super rich, their global affluence evident as their private jets swooped into the Swiss Alps at Davos, an annual bash of eclectic celebrity capitalists where India was supposedly doing a showstopper-walk, and the tragic suicide of  , an 84-year-old beleaguered farmer from Maharashtra who committed suicide amid the hustle-bustle of Mumbai's non-stop irrepressible energy. There could not have been a more apposite paradox to explain India's inherent contradictions. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made another of his highfalutin speeches to hard-sell India (even as India Inc palpably serenaded him on bent knees, despite the snow), but appeared blissfully unaware of some hard economic data that had surfaced concomitantly from the organisers, the World Economic Forum itself. India's ranking in the Inclusive Development Index had slumped to 62; an appalling commentary on the skewed policies of the last four years of Mr Modi's government which has increased social disparities. Not surprisingly, it seemed to synchronise with the astonishing fact that  . US President Donald Trump followed Modi to justify his America First pitch to the august gathering of essentially free-market fundamentalists. Like India, America has seen an escalating income inequality, ironically electing a tax-evading, anti-free trade, ultra-nationalist avatar in a billionaire businessman with a dubious track-record as its man in the White House. Politics is indeed weird. Even as India's stock markets breached stratospheric levels crossing 35,000 levels prompting pink papers to go into uncontrollable euphoria, Dharma Patil lay dead at JJ hospital. The state government of Maharashtra had refused to respond to his several entreaties for help after it acquired his land for a pathetic pittance. It was unconscionable. The opposition blamed the government of Devendra Fadnavis for culpable homicide; in effect, it was callous nonchalance to a desperate cry for help. It was a stark reminder of one Gajendra Singh from Rajasthan who hung himself from a tree while an election rally proceeded with much fanfare in New Delhi. It was an ugly manifestation of a society that had forgotten its once revered creator of the rice bowl. Evidently, we have chosen to turn a blind eye to the hapless farmer, once deserving of a national call; Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. Arun Jaitley, India's Finance Minister, who famously declared that India will double farmers' income in five years, has been extraordinarily silent on his progress report. Perhaps that is understandable given that after four years of the Modi government , the average agricultural growth is just 1.9 per cent. To achieve the ambitious growth levels projected with profuse showmanship by the government, a minimum of 12 per cent is needed. The target is ridiculously off the curve, but ask any policy wonk and he will tell you that it is always a preposterous kite-flying exercise. That begs the question, have we become so politically immoral that we make even suffering farmers dream of bountiful profits when in fact it is nothing more than a mirage, a chimera? Or are Indian politicians, once elected, decoupled from ground realities? In his farewell budget on February 1, 2018, Mr Jaitley made another grandiloquent claim; that his government had successfully provided for minimum support price of 50 per cent over cost-of-crop production as it had promised in its 2014 manifesto. It seemed like a stunning apocryphal story, because the definition of the cost of production had been deliberately left ambiguous. The convenient formula was adopted, but based on that measure, the farmers were getting 50 per cent over MSP since the UPA days. In that case, what was Modi promising during the 2014 election campaign? At the time of writing, very few in the mainstream media have even questioned this brazen inconsistency. Mr Modi also magnanimously laid out the red carpet for foreign investors citing India's charming hospitality and tranquil environs. But back home it was anything but. The release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's   was meshed in  , and agitating Karni Sena supporters had become official non-state actors, as several BJP state governments happily catapulted to their intimidating threat to not release the controversial film. Chopping off heads of those who were related to the film was publicly broadcasted by these insidious hate groups, but the prime minister did not think a strong condemnation was necessary. Despite a scathing indictment from the Supreme Court, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh refused to screen the film, citing law and order risks. It was tantamount to acquiescing that they were incapable of ensuring governance, despite having the full police force under their authority. The world could see the farcical melodrama turning violent, but India's elected leaders did not budge. What was once classified as right wing fringe was now a legitimate mainstream disruptor, courtesy official umbrage. Their poisonous footprint is on the rise, as punitive action has not been taken. At last count the film was headed for blockbuster box-office collections, and the Rajput community had not found anything offensive enough about it. So what was the purpose behind the belligerent posturing? And why did Indian politicians play ball? But on the day of the hugely hyped budget, something remarkable happened. Even as Mr Jaitley gave his budget speech, from nearby Rajasthan, people spoke in collective unison, condemning both the wilful neglect of the farming community and the senseless mayhem over a commercial film. The BJP got a   in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat. The voters had seen through their forked tongue that sells stardust dreams even as it deliberately ignores solving the real issues. February 1 was a reminder that Indian democracy was still alive.

At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ","date":"2018-02-04","tag":"Tamil Nadu,Hindi,MK Stalin,Tamil","title":"Hindi is becoming a rallying point in Tamil Nadu politics again","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tamil-mk-stalin-hindi-tamil-nadu-karunanidhi-madras-high-court-anti-hindi-agitation/story/1/22178.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15286},{"author":"M Reyaz","content":"One of the top trends on Twitter on Saturday was #AnkitSaxena, a 23-year old young photographer from Delhi   by the family members of the 20-year old girl he was allegedly in a relationship with for three years. No, Ankit's case was not trending merely to demand justice for the victim's family or as a debate over the law and order situation in the national capital. Not even because some custodians of culture and tradition are supporting the murderers or because Twitterati are outraged over the \"honour killing\". Ankit's case has instead given the right wing and their whole politics grounds to demonise and target the community they love to hate. Ankit's girlfriend Shehzadi was a Muslim. His killers, the girl's father, mother, uncle and a minor brother also come from the same faith. She had allegedly locked her family members in the house and fled after an argument. The enraged father, accompanied by other family members, came out with a knife in his hand and found Ankit, who lived nearby in west Delhi, on a scooter. A scuffle started. According to the police, as the family members held Ankit tightly, the father of the girl slit his throat. All accused have already been arrested, and a case has been filed at the local police station in west Delhi. One hopes that the law will take its course and the aggrieved family will get justice. What is troubling is that instead of asking for justice certain media and the right wing forces are using the case to bash the entire Muslim community and they are being forced to condemn the gruesome incident. So far only in terror cases guilt by association was raised to target one community, but even though not one person has spoken in support of the murderers, the whole community is being demonised and bashed. Imagine for a moment that the boy was Muslim and girl a Hindu, the right wing would have justified the incident in the name of a purported case of \"love jihad\". On the contrary, I have not come across any Muslim on social media justifying the murder; rather they have all expressed shock, some have condemned it and demanded swift action from the police. It is rather ironical that the same people who are targeting the Muslim community would be asking people to celebrate on February 14, the Valentine's Day, as \"Matri Pitri Poojan Diwas\", and have called Hadiya a victim of love jihad. Religion must have played an important role in the decision of Shehzadi's family to not accept their daughter's choice, but it is more of a patriarchal problem than anything else. I have written earlier, how families find any pretext under the sky to  . Our society at large has still not come to terms with the fact that adult men and women can themselves make a better decision in choosing their life partner, and would rather get them married to people of their choice. The so-called   is one of most dishonourable things for any society that claims to be civilised, irrespective of religion or creed or caste. Professor Dibyesh Anand of Westminster University rightly pointed out after the incident, \"The lethal concept is not a religion but proprietorial-patriarchal-family-honour that afflicts many Hindus, Muslims, and others alike.\" Killing a daughter or her partner for defying them is not unique to any one community but is a larger malaise in our part of the world that sadly often has sanctions from religious leaders as well as community formations such as khap panchayats. Only in January, there was a report of a (Hindu)   as he had dared to marry the girl from another caste. And ironically on the same day Ankit was murdered, I saw a  , of a woman being savagely flogged for an alleged extramarital affair. There is a lesson we can all learn from Ankit's father, Yashpal Saxena. He , who reportedly visited the family, \"I do not have hatred against any community.

The Opposition has claimed that Patil consumed the poison outside chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s office at the sixth floor of Mantralaya as the government failed to deliver justice to him. Patil had received compensation of Rs 4 lakh for his five-acre farm whereas his neighbour Kisan Girase got Rs 1.98 crore for one-acre farmland, though both of them had planted mango trees. The case has exposed the chinks in the state’s administration as well as the unholy practices adopted while granting compensation to land. Girase stands accused of paying a bribe of Rs 1 crore to the officials from land acquisition department to get higher compensation. At the same time, a nexus between officials and land-selling agents also has come to fore. Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar admits that the nexus exists. “The government does not make any discrimination between the beneficiaries. It is the officials who misinterpret and take disadvantage of the government schemes,” he told me. It has become a trend over a couple of years to plant mango trees in farm land to increase its value at the time of land acquisition even though the climate does not suit the trees. Water resources minister Girish Mahajan points that agents purchase land from poor farmers at throwaway prices, “import” mango trees from Konkan and demand higher price at the time of acquisition. The mango trees are literally “replanted” to create an impression that they exist in a particular farm land for many years. As per rules, if a farm land has mango trees its values grows multifold. In some cases, the government has given Rs 1 crore for one acre farm land when the actual price was Rs 10 lakh because of the mango trees. “This is not possible without the direct involvement of government officials,” Mahajan admitted. “They know it better which land would be acquired for which project.” He pointed that the government had carried survey of the proposed super communication highway between Nagpur and Mumbai, known as Samruddhi Corridor, using Google maps to count the number of trees on the patch before the project was announced. “If we had not done that the agents would have replanted mango trees everywhere on the corridor making the project economically unviable,” Mahajan said. The government has reserved Rs 10,000 crore only for compensation to land acquisition. The nexus exists for a long time.

A grand scheme intended to tackle an incredibly serious policy issue with almost no details of know-how in the public domain. Yet, it was celebrated as if the outcome it sought had already been achieved. Yesterday (February 1) seemed no different. Once again we forgot what   was good at: fooling us with lofty goals with a tinge of morality added to it. “Modicare”, as it’s now being touted, seeks to provide health insurance to about 100 million “vulnerable” families across India. About 40 per cent of the country’s population (or 500 million beneficiaries) will be \"protected\" under the scheme. Yet somehow its being touted as a system of universal healthcare. A universal scheme should generally cover all citizens, but that’s a matter of separate debate. Unsurprisingly, it overshadowed pretty much everything else in the discussions around the Budget (including a higher fiscal deficit, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax and changes to custom duties for about 50 items). It was supposedly the \"aha moment\" of the  for many TV news anchors and commentators. The general consensus was that the poor and the destitute end up spending a large portion of their income on secondary and tertiary healthcare and that the government is right in providing a helping hand. Imagine if they don’t need to save for a rainy day? Imagine if they are free to use that money to consume goods and services? Imagine what would it do to accelerate growth, and thereby generate greater revenue? Undoubtedly, all of these instances are possible, but it requires a rock-solid combination of detailed plans, smooth execution, a big pot of cash and a ton of luck. Unfortunately, the way our governments are designed, its hard if not impossible to hit such a sweet spot. In this case as well, no basic plan has been charted out yet. The current plan is to draft a plan in the next six months. In terms of execution, it’s best not to glorify government’s notoriously poor record in implementation of schemes. As for cash, the government could easily end up spending thousands of crores of rupees (maybe a lot more depending on premiums). Where will the money come for it is anyone’s guess. But what seems eerily similar to demonetisation is that no cost-benefit analysis of the scheme seems to have been done. And just like demonetisation, this will most certainly become BJP’s major talking point during elections. Leaving aside these minor technicalities, one has to seriously ask if 500 million individuals in India need mandatory insurance from the government? Sure, no one is arguing against not providing subsidy to those below poverty line (and maybe others). But what about those who can? Wouldn’t they be better off left alone in deciding their choice of insurance and allow the government to use the valuable tax revenue for an alternative purpose? Choice matters as that will allow greater competition amongst private/public insurance companies and not just benefit those who are contracted with the government. India has only so many resources at hand and it would have been ideal to allow states to chart their own course (health is a state subject) rather than initiate a massive scheme from the top. Secondly, most debates moved around the ifs and buts on the health coverage. Not many offered a view from an ideological and principled standpoint. It’s rather easy to get bothered by questions around the government’s ability to fund or implement the project, but its far more important to ask if the government should sponsor such a scheme at all. A similar scheme was proposed in 2016 which offered a coverage of Rs 30,000 per family. That has now been raised to Rs 5 lakh per family. Those in Opposition can always offer another substantial hike until we will reach a point of no return. What are the chances that the government will do away with such a mandate even when most Indians will easily be able to afford it? Third, instead of focusing on drafting policies (reforming land, labour and capital) that would eventually pull people out of poverty and allow them to make enough money to pay for their own and family’s health/education, the government is creating another tax-payer funded entitlement. Yes, both (growth and redistribution) can go on simultaneously, but there is just not enough noise and movement on the former. What looks probable right now is that we will go through another loop of good intentions and bad outcomes. But considering how lucky PM Modi is (and was through the execution of demonetisation), it may just work in his favour, of course electorally.","date":"2018-02-02","tag":"Modi government,Union Budget 2018,Health insurance","title":"Budget 2018: How achievable is Arun Jaitley's promise of health cover for 500 million poor Indians?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/health-insurance-union-budget-arun-jaitley-demonetisation-november-8-2016-modi-election-promise/story/1/22143.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15289},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"Going into the last full Union Budget of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only bet on the farmers, but bet the farm on his rural voters. Articulating his vision for the general election of 2019 quite clearly, he has recognised the existence of rural distress, amplified by a string of farmer protests and suicides last year provoked by falling commodity prices and increasing debt. Hoping to deliver on his promise to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, the Budget has shown every intention of boosting farmers’ incomes by raising the minimum support price for crops to 1.5x the cost of production, liberalising export of agri-commodities, and modernising agricultural markets. This comes in the wake of agri-GDP registering an insipid average annual growth rate of 2 per cent in the first three years of the Modi government - in the last three years of the UPA rule, it was nearly twice this figure. The second clear narrative in Modi Vision 2019 is the creation of jobs. The Budget has seen a push to small businesses, which were badly hit both by demonetisation and the initial implementation of GST. The corporate tax reduction for firms with turnovers below Rs 250 crore as well as Rs 3,794 crore in credit support to MSMEs could help. The continuing push to infrastructure, with expected investments in excess of Rs 50 lakh crore in roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways, is also of a piece with this strong effort - unemployment emerged as the biggest concern among respondents to the India Today Mood of the Nation Poll last week, along with rising prices. Equally clear is the government’s belated recognition of the importance of healthcare and education. As Amartya Sen says, no developed country in the world has progressed without investing in these key areas. On education, the Budget has announced Eklavya schools for tribals as well as 24 new medical colleges and 1,000 new fellowships for doctoral students. In healthcare, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an ambitious National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide up to Rs 5 lakh per year to 100 million families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. Impressive as this sounds, I am not sure the mechanisms or details of funding have been worked out. The expense could be monumental. There is a disconcertingly familiar sense of too many announcements and too little implementation. Take the example of the Smart Cities Mission, announced in 2015, which aimed at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-the-art amenities. So far, 99 cities have been selected with an outlay of Rs 2.04 lakh crore. But projects worth a mere Rs 2,350 crore have been completed. The rest remain \"in progress\". That’s a pathetic strike rate, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the government’s ability to deliver. Given the additional spending, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019 will require disinvestment and the highest ever gross taxes as a percentage of GDP. It is a tough ask, according to Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi, one of the eminent economists in our panel of commentators, but not entirely unachievable. The Budget has nothing for the middle class and large corporates, who in many ways are the bulwark of the economy. The big question is, whether all this will be enough - especially given that the GDP growth rate is expected to fall to 6.75 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to 7.1 the previous year. So far, the economic environment was conducive, but now oil prices have crossed $70 a barrel internationally, and retail inflation has breached the RBI’s target, hitting 5.21 per cent in December. Also, there is nothing to spur the investment rate which has fallen from a peak of nearly 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 26.4 per cent in 2017-18. Unless the government is able to move the needle on this, it is difficult to imagine the accelera­tion in economic growth so necessary to finance its ambitious schemes. My own nagging concern is an old one: I am not sure how much of government expenditure actually reaches the intended beneficiary. In 1985, on a visit to drought-affected Kalahandi in Odisha, the late Rajiv Gandhi said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reached the intended recipient. Has that leaky bucket been fixed? If not, the electoral benefits this government is hoping  for after this Budget may not materialise. Elections are not won on grand announcements or manifestos, but on real development on the ground which people can feel.

And when she’s not working, meaning governing the state or minding politics, she is into creative pursuits — writing books, penning lyrics, composing songs, painting and doodling. Mamata Banerjee has been recently awarded the prestigious DLitt by Calcutta University for her versatile contribution in the field of literature and language and for her gigantic footprints in social work. There was much hue and cry, storm over tea stalls, debates dragging into court as to whether she merited the honorary degree. Ultimately she got the degree and she accepted it teary-eyed and her voice choking, partly for the love and appreciation of a section of people, who considered her eligible, and partly for the insult, humiliation and barbs she had to face in the process. Without going into the sanctity of the awardee, the literary merit of her work, which can be purely subjective (depending on who are judging it, on what basis, under what condition and who are conferring the title), one cannot deny the sheer numbers she has added to the world of printed letters. Half a dozen books a year is child’s play for her and she has been spewing such volume at every Kolkata Book Fair. And for all her detractors crying foul, the books are published by a leading publishing house of Bengal and they are always bestsellers — well at least as per the records of the publishing house. This year too, as the city warms up to another book fair, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is coming out again with not less than half a dozen new publications. She has a volume of already 70 published works and this year it will increase to 76. And think of the range, she has something for everyone: names of babies for would-be or new parents, rhyme-books for toddlers,   for children,   (voice of heart) Urdu shayaris for the youth,   — something about personality development of the young generation, and   (exhorting the young brigade to consider politics as a noble profession) to travelogues ( ) for the trotting community. Her memoirs on struggle —  , the tidbits of bitter-sweet memories of life —  , her youth, desires sacrificed at the altar of politics — Bikel Hnariye Geche (a personal note on how the sweet spring has slipped by), and   — a compilation of quotable quotes on the philosophy and ideology of her life, an allusion to Kathamrita — quotes of Ram Krishna Dev for the spiritually inclined, are her other book. Not to be missed is the historical documentation of important landmark events from the political work — Nandi Ma (the land movement in Nandigram), Singur, Kutshapokksho (Rumour Mongers), a commentary on how the Opposition and the BJP-led Centre were engaged in a slandering campaign to malign her on the eve of 2016 Assembly, Notebandi (Demonetisation) and this year its   (intolerance). Though the majority of the political memoirs are political campaign on her sweat and labour and the string of achievements she has been weaving in, Asohishnuta is an interesting record of the environment of hatred, fear and intolerance unleashed by the saffron party both in the country and her state. The diversity of subject and magnitude of work apart, one should not miss the proficiency of language, the ease with which she nimbly moves through languages, Bengali, English, Urdu and Ol Chiki, some of her books are being translated into Ol Chiki. So if these are not grounds, solid enough to confer her the D.litt, what are? As for the sceptical and high-browed critics, especially those who are deprecating, the Calcutta University as the conferring body chose to seal all probable leaks. The award has been given by virtue of her literary works and her social welfare activities, which have been acknowledged internationally and she has even got the prestigious UN Public Service award for Kanyashree — the scheme for empowering women. The DLitt debate has been dismissed by the court perhaps because it realised that wisdom lies in closing the chapter. After all, there is nothing new in conferring titles and awards to political personalities, great administrators and statesman and it has been the practice all over the world. When men of letters like Dr Mammohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and legends like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi get awarded, the country bursts into euphoria, and rightly so. But the feeling definitely cannot be the same when Akshay Kumar (University of Windsor in 2008) and Shilpa Shetty Kundra flaunt one or godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim claims a doctorate title from some little known UK university. The fact that PM Narendra Modi declined to be awarded a doctorate by BHU in 2016 at the peak of his popularity in recognition of him being a reformer and an outstanding leader in public service and governance is a rare, pragmatic thing. Had he accepted he would have invited similar muck throwing as happened in the case of Mamata.

At least, that was his poll promise of \"na goondaraj, na bhrashtachar (freedom from goons and corruption)\" to the state. However, this year's Republic Day clashes tell a very different story altogether. As residents of Kasganj, belonging to different communities, began preparing for the 69th Republic Day celebrations, a group of ABVP and VHP cadres set out on a bike rally. Passing through every mohalla, they finally reached Baliram Gate. This group, which had no police permission, was also carrying saffron flags - enough to instigate a communal outburst. As they approached the minority-dominated area, their slogans grew louder. Soon, what started out as a verbal spat turned into a violent clash with both sides throwing stones at the other. One man reached for his gun and fired in frenzy which hit 20-year-old Chandan Gupta, killing him two hours later. Another man, Naushad, was also hit in the leg by a bullet and is now recovering at an Aligarh hospital. This was enough to trigger the mob, which went on a rampage across the town. The district police force was in Etah for the Republic Day parade as the town erupted into flames. A mosque was set ablaze and the police, in an FIR, said stones were hurled and bullets fired on them as they tried to quell the commotion. By afternoon, Yogi's promise of \"na goondaraj\" was blown into pieces as shops and buses burning to cinders became the image of Kasganj. The police, unable to control the situation, imposed curfew to restrict mob movement. One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and five companies of Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) along with police forces from adjoining districts were deployed in Kasganj. The district magistrate, inspector-general of police, commissioner of Aligarh and at least half a dozen other IPS officers from adjoining areas were deputed to control the surging violence. But all these measures had no bearing on the rapidly deteriorating condition of Kasganj. Around 9.30pm, Lakhimpur resident Mohammad Akram, unaware of the violence, was on his way home with his pregnant wife in a Tata Safari. As he reached Kasganj, the mob attacked his car. They broke the windows with bamboo sticks and almost gouged out his left eye. \"They saw my beard and attacked me. My wife is expecting and the delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,\" Akram said, his face covered in blood. Akram was attacked in the middle of the town, Agrasen Gate, and the police was absolutely unaware of the situation. Fortunately, the local correspondent of Aaj Tak, Devesh Pal Singh, who was present there informed a senior police officer even as he recorded a video on his mobile phone. By this time, the mob had already put kerosene on Akram and his pregnant wife in an attempt to burn them alive. The senior officer responded swiftly and sent his forces just in time to save them. Akram is now recuperating in a hospital. Just 50 metres from here, BJP MP Rajveer Singh, along with a few other legislators, district magistrate and police officers were at the residence of Chandan Gupta, requesting them to cremate Chandan's body, but the family was struck to their demand of \"status of martyrdom\" for their dead son. The deadlock ended around 2am after the family was given verbal assurance of a government job to a family member and Rs 50 lakh as compensation. However, three days after his death, Chandan's family has received a cheque of Rs 20 lakh. On January 27, Chandan was cremated in the morning and even as his mortal remains were set on the pyre, Kasganj continued to burn. Around 200 meters from the cremation ground, one bus and a shop were set on fire while some locals vandalised a garage. Minutes later, three more buses and three shops were set ablaze by them. All the shops and vehicles were owned by the local Muslim population who till one day ago were living peacefully with the Hindus.  What was shocking was that these incidents were taking place within a range of 500 metres from where hundreds of policemen and two companies of paramilitary forces were standing guard.  As we witnessed, it appeared that a section of the locals belonging to a particular community were given a free hand by the local administration, allowing them to go on a rampage against the minorities.   Parliamentarian Rajveer Singh in a statement to us blamed the Muslims for the clashes. \"Muslims are responsible for this incident. It was pre-planned and they will be dealt with strict action,\" he said. Virendra Tomar, VHP leader, said, \"It's time for us to give a fitting reply to \"love jihad\". If they kill one of us, we will kill 10 of them. The police is our servant and they will work on our instructions.\" After several incidents of violence since the morning of January 27, the mob, led by a local VHP leader, took on the policemen. With no courage to face the crowd, a senior police officer called a VHP leader and requested him to ask their cadres to vacate the streets. The VHP leader agreed to the officer's request, but while walking away, he warned the police that within 48 hours, they will ensure that Kasganj is on fire. The political conspiracy was quite clear following the clashes which started on January 26. Now, there was only pressure from the innocent locals and media on the administration and police officers to act.  On January 28, when we confronted the suprintendent of police, Sunil Singh (who has now been transferred), as to why they failed to control the situation, he categorically said, \"This is being done on the instructions of a few people (higher-ups) and I cannot rule out any political conspiracy.\" His statement on camera probably cost him his job as he was transferred from Kasganj. Politics over Kasganj violence is at its peak with BJP and VHP leaders making controversial remarks, and parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party blaming the BJP for polarisation for the upcoming elections. In this political tussle, the ones suffering are the common people. Situated on the banks of Kala Nadi (Black river), most of the population in Kasganj is dependent on daily business for their survival. With a population of little above one million, Kasganj district has approximately 66 per cent Hindus and 33 per cent Muslims. And in last one decade, there has been no incident of any communal violence. Five days on, Kanganj continues to simmer while politicians are busy trying to cash in on communal sentiments.  ","date":"2018-01-31","tag":"Republic Day,Mohammad Akram,Yogi Adityanath,Kasganj violence","title":"How politics is fanning the communal flames in Kasganj","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kasganj-violence-mohammad-akram-pregnant-wife-district-magistrate-sunil-singh-transferred-yogi-adityanath/story/1/22090.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15292},{"author":"AVM Manmohan Bahadur","content":"Technological asymmetry has been an understated cog that goes into deciding victors in interstate conflicts — for, it is finally the image of a victorious soldier, sailor or airman that lingers — on in human memory. While the \"man behind the machine\" is important, there comes a stage where the superiority of warfighting implements overcomes the prowess of a warrior. We have witnessed that when the bow and arrow overcame the mightiest of land warriors only to be overcome itself by the lance; the bow, lance, sword, shield et al were steamrolled when gun powder came on the scene. And so has been the story over centuries leading to tanks, submarines and now air power, whose instruments have become deciding factors in winning battles and affecting the way war progresses. Adverse technological asymmetry has been fatal down history; India is in the dangerous position of getting on the wrong side of the tech asymmetry curve vis-a-vis its neighbours, especially China — this should be lighting up red bulbs in South Block. The Chinese military-industrial complex has matured to a point where it has become the world’s third largest major arms exporter. Though this is especially true in the field of air defence systems, UAVs and mid-capability fighter and transport aircraft. While the J-20 stealth aircraft has been inducted (production rate being ramped to 36 aircraft per year) and is going through its operational paces, there are reports that the J-31 is being converted to become a carrier borne stealth fighter. This would affect Indian naval power adversely as there are no reports of a corresponding development for the Indian Navy, which is still debating after the shelving of the Naval Tejas programme, whether to get more trouble prone MiG-29K for the indigenous aircraft carrier or some other foreign aircraft. The Chinese have produced the sixth Y-20 Very Heavy Transport Aircraft which will become the mainstay of long range airlift as well as the base aircraft for AWACS and inflight refuelling. They have tied up with the Russians for making a new Advanced Heavy Lift helicopter for the Tibetan plateau and have bought from Ukraine, lock stock and barrel, rights to the world’s biggest transport aircraft, the An-225. The massive airlift capability that will accrue to the PLA can well be imagined! Secure communications, that are so vital in war, will become their forte with research being done in quantum technology. Similar advancements are happening in the land and naval armament arena but the advantage that India presently has with its superior aircraft and aircrew over its Northern frontiers may be slowly slipping away. Air power assets do not come cheap and it is necessary that a nation, vying for a seat at the table of the powerful, commits enough monies towards their acquisition. While the depleting squadron strength of the IAF is being regularly debated, it is the other equally vital aspects too that merit government’s attention. We have only three AWACS and six Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and no additional ones on the horizon. This writer is witness to the selection of a new FRA in 2009, but the proposal was shot down on \"high\" costs. The reshoot of the project met a similar fate five years hence and now we have floated another tender last week! Will this be cheaper now? No way! Reports from HAL about the ramping up of Tejas are not encouraging and prototype testing of the Tejas Mk1A, eighty-three of which will be bought, is some distance away. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft seems a mirage while the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft project is still on the drawing board. The real silver lining is the transport aircraft and helicopter fleets of the IAF that constitute a very potent airlift capability, but these aircraft too are all imported – hopefully, their maintenance contracts are being addressed in time to have adequate availability on the flight line. A healthy combat-ready flight line demonstrates the deterrence that air power affords a nation. The forthcoming national budget is awaited with great anticipation by the armed forces. Technological asymmetry should not be allowed to handicap our first-rate war fighters. : The Economic Survey for 2017-18 brings out the startling fact that India spends only 0.7 per cent of its GDP on Research & Development while China spends 2.1 per cent, the US 2.8 per cent and Israel 4.3 per cent. If the R&D spend is worked out in monetary terms the huge difference between China and India would be abundantly clear as Beijing’s GDP is five times India’s. It is a no-brainer that this is a clear indicator of the fact that technological asymmetry would only increase unless some radical steps are urgently taken by the government to ameliorate the imbalance.

After all, pooh-poohed its strategic experts, the first iteration a decade ago was short-lived and fizzled out. The Quad’s second coming, however, has so far appeared more robust — or robust enough to concern Beijing. Two top officials who travelled to Delhi in December — state councillor Yang Jiechi and foreign minister Wang Yi — both made oblique references to the danger of “small groups” getting together with the aim of containing others. They both also referred to what they saw as unhelpful meddling by the US in the South China Sea and hoped India would continue its “independent” foreign policy. So, when four top naval officials of the Quad countries took the stage together in Delhi in January’s Raisina Dialogue, Beijing duly saw red. Especially when the commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, openly called China a disruptor, and Japan’s naval chief Admiral Kawano called for countries to come together to counter Chinese naval expansionism amid muscle-flexing in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The hawkish Chinese tabloid   wrote that “the Raisina Dialogue was elaborately planned to serve as a platform for countries like the US, Japan and Australia, to show their tough stance towards China and Russia, and meanwhile demonstrate India’s position of trying to balance between Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region, in addition to India’s independent major power status and dissatisfaction with China.” The unprecedented joint attendance of 10 ASEAN leaders, days later at the Republic Day parade in Delhi, further deepened the angst in Beijing, with the same newspaper in an editorial raging that “some members of the Indian elite enjoy engaging in geopolitical bluster. But they cannot truly gauge the reality of India’s comprehensive strength and diplomatic experience. They are beginners playing at geopolitics.” “New Delhi is not Beijing’s major trading partner, and, despite border disputes, is not an imminent security threat to us Chinese,” the editorial said. “However, some Indians keep pestering us, asking us to acknowledge that India is developing better than China.” New Delhi, with a GDP that’s only one-fifth of China’s, has been striving to prevail over Beijing in almost all aspects.” It concluded, “Honestly speaking, Chinese people are not occupied by India.” But apparently occupied enough to warrant a stream of concerned editorials in the state media.

Both Dalit leaders - one from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the other from Gujarat - they are charismatic young men who offer possibilities of a new and vibrant Dalit movement in a national landscape as riven by caste as ever. Both are lawyers, both are Ambedkarite - Azad more than Mevani - and both are modern rationalists in the Ambedkarite tradition. To be sure, they are not Dalit Panthers. Azad, despite the fact that he calls his group an army, spends most of his efforts on ensuring education for Dalit children. Mevani works to ensure land officially belonging to Dalits is returned to them. Both are constitutional leaders, believers in the rule of law, anti-violence and careful to defuse any situation that has the potential to turn violent. Despite widespread claims that both either incite or actually preach violence they have been against stoking of conflict between Dalits and Muslims or retaliatory actions against upper caste violence. It is symptomatic of our times that despite this, both are seen as terrifying threats to the Indian state, the media and the right wing middle and upper castes and classes in India - all of which amount to the same thing really.  chief Azad is in jail under a battery of false cases since June 2017. More recently the UP government has   under the National Security Act, an absurd law to invoke in his case. Mevani is constantly attacked in the media, especially since he joined electoral politics and won a seat in Vadgam, Gujarat. Recently he came under fire for refusing to entertain Republic TV in Chennai and for offering a critical appraisal of BR Ambedkar which was predictably and deliberately taken out of context. Why are the two such threats despite being no more than militant liberals? Part of the answer lies in the fact that they have an Ambedkarite pride in their Dalit identity and are very clear that it is their right and duty not to be quiet in the face of caste-based abuse and exploitation. In the feudal state of Uttar Pradesh, Azad and Mevani have emerged as a formidable challenge at a time the threat posed by the   lost both substance and direction. The BJP therefore considers it important to quash them and their politics at all costs. In the deeply communal Gujarat, the mobilisation of Dalits and Muslims by a dynamic leader can spell doom for the dominant BJP. The recent elections and Mevani's thumping victory was a taste of that destabilising effect for the dominant party. Both men are also articulate and not fooled by any of the smokescreen discourses of the dominant party. If Mevani is the more urbane and suave of the two, Azad has a clarity born from being grounded in his location and a compassion that gives his home-grown north Indian machismo an unusual edge. This is why both are an anathema to the mostly inarticulate, unintelligent leaders of the dominant, or indeed, any party. Both men came to prominence over democratic contestations of violence against Dalits. In Mevani's case, it was the atrocity in Una; in Azad's case the atrocity in Shabbirpur. This is really at the heart of the hatred, fear and resentment directed against the two. They are not going to remain silent about atrocities against Dalits and their responses to it are not reactive but proactive, collective and systematic. Mevani has openly spoken in support of Azad, particularly after his arrest. The combination of the two men is more frightening than taking on them individually. Mevani has the theoretical tools and a critical engagement with history, Ambedkarite and otherwise. His speech taken out of the context by the media recently shows that he is neither hagiographic about Ambedkar nor his Communist heroes and knows that historical circumstances have changed and so must theories, even as his primary commitment to their vision remains. Azad has a hands-on engagement with the community which forms the foundation of his politics but his vision is resolutely and uncritically Ambedkarite. Both have much to offer each other and what is important is that both are cognisant of the need to combine theoretical vision and grassroots politics. Mevani sees himself as a social movement activist; Azad sees himself as putting Ambedkarite thinking into action. Both have much to say to each other. But with a hostile state, media and middle class combine, things are not easy for them. The internet Ambedkarites are mostly silent about them, when not critical of them. That is the privilege of internet activists. They do not have to get their hands dirty. It is important for us to nurture these two young men. They are by no means perfect but they are the best we have. On gender, their thinking has not gone very far. On the issue of politics of sexuality, they have not thought much. Neither of them is in touch with his subconscious - both deal mainly with the rational and the legal/constitutional - but it is our duty to widen the scope of their vision.

Seeking cooperation of the youth in the battle against corruption and black money, the PM said, “I don’t think any youth of my country is now willing to tolerate corruption. The hate for corruption in the society is visible… I want you to help end corruption that is like a termite.\" Countering the general perception that the rich and the powerful mostly get away while the poor get the short shrift in corruption cases, the PM said, “The country used to discuss corruption in despair, the lament being 'no one catches the powerful'. Three former chief ministers are now rotting in jail. Who says there is no justice? No one will be spared.\" The prime minister was talking about the three former chief ministers who are currently in jail. While former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra have been convicted and sentenced in cases related to the fodder scam, former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala is serving a jail term following conviction in a recruitment scam. Three former chief ministers landing in jail on graft charges is certainly unprecedented in seven decades of independent India as far as corruption is concerned. It is also not the norm in a country where the general perception is that the powerful political class is never punished, and are above the law. But going by how the prime minister placed the issue in his speech, it may seem like it was his government which ensured the conviction of these powerful people. But is that truly the case? Let us first talk about the fodder scam cases. In March 1996, the CBI was brought into the case as per the Supreme Court’s order. Lalu Yadav was named as accused in six cases.  The central investigation agency filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused in 1997.  On 30 September 2013, a special CBI court in Ranchi convicted former Lalu Prasad Yadav and Jagannath Mishra along with 44 others in the case. The court had announced a sentence of five years for Lalu Yadav and four years for Jagannath Mishra. On January 6, Lalu Yadav was again convicted in another fodder scam case and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. On January 24, a special CBI court in Ranchi awarded five years jail to Lalu Yadav and Jagannath Mishra, this being the third case in which verdict has been pronounced. Barring orders by the courts in the last two cases, nothing has happened after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister of India. So his or his government’s role is certainly not a factor in sending Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra to jail. In the teacher’s recruitment scam case, in which former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala has been convicted, started in 2003. The Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe. In June 2008, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the court of special CBI judge against 62 people including OP Chautala. In January 2013, the court convicted Chautala and sent him to jail for 10 years. So Om Prakash Chautala was already in jail by the time Modi became the prime minister. It is very clear from the facts that in none of the three court cases involving the three former chief ministers did Modi or his government has a role to play. So while decrying corruption, the PM forgot to clarify that the credit for putting these powerful politicians behind bars was not his for the taking.  Is this not a form of moral corruption, or did the PM not realise what he was implying?","date":"2018-01-30","tag":"Fodder Scam,Black Money,Narendra Modi,Corruption","title":"Modi may be hitting corruption hard, but what has jail for 3 former CMs to do with him?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/corruption-bjp-modi-black-money-fodder-scam-lalu-yadav-jagannath-mishra-op-chautala/story/1/22062.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15296},{"author":"Harsh Mander","content":"Our second day of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018 was India’s 67th Republic Day. We spent this day travelling in remote rural Bengal, meeting families of three young men who were lynched, and their bodies mutilated and dismembered. This was one more lynching in the country that was celebrated by videotaping the killing and circulating the recording triumphantly on social media. It was claimed at that time, by the crowds, the police and even representatives of the ruling party, that a mob of villagers killed them because they were cow thieves. The story we heard in our travels was all too familiar, one troublingly similar to those that we have heard over and over again in the eight states to which the Karwan has travelled so far. It was the evening of the 27th roza fast of Ramazan in Eid on   midsummer last year. Three friends in three different villages in the North Bengal district of Uttar Dinajpur were enjoying the special Iftar meal to break their fasts with their families, in anticipation of the Eid celebrations that were to follow. The friends were all in their mid-twenties. Two were day labourers ready to do any work that was locally offered to them – construction work, farm labour, tea leaf plucking, and whatever else came their way; one was trying to set up a small business. All the three friends were married, with small children. Each of their families reported to us that their mobile phones rang while they were eating. Each said that the young men initially said to whoever called that they were reluctant to leave their family celebrations but finally conceded. They speculate that because the three of them often took petty construction assignments together, perhaps this was what they were called away so urgently for. But they now have no way of knowing for sure. Two of the young men left on their bikes, one walked and was picked up some distance away. They did not return that night. The next morning, each of the families was summoned to the police station. To collect their sons’ savaged bodies, dead and mutilated after mob lynching. The first family we met was in the village Dhulagoch. The young man Nasruddin’s ageing father, Yasin Mohammed, with a white beard, white singlet and blue lungi customary for men of his age, met us weeping. For the hour that we were with him, he would not leave my hand. He was joined by his mother, bent over with age and mourning, the boy’s mother, his widow Anisa and their two small children. The entire family sobbed out loud and long as they shared with us the trauma of his loss six months earlier, and the nightmare of what followed. He used to work in Delhi as a truck driver. After a road accident, his father called him back home. It did not matter if he earned less as work was uncertain and low-paid. At least he was safe and close to home. The morning after he did not return home, a policeman of the village came to their home in civil clothes. He showed them a video of a lynching. To their horror, they could recognise that one of the young men being attacked was Nasruddin. They rushed to the police station, only to be handed his bloodied and defaced dead body. The distraught families of his two friends were also there. We met their families as well in the course of our journey today. Nasirul’s mother Masida Begum and wife Marjina in the village Kutipada; and Samiruddin’s widow in the village Kandapora. Nasirul’s widow gave birth to a daughter months after he had died. Two of the bodies of the young men were lying in an ambulance, and a third on a hospital stretcher. They were disfigured and dismembered, with limbs smashed and crushed, and even their genitals stoned. The police would tell them nothing more than that villagers of a neighbouring Hindu village Durgapur had found them stealing cows. They had caught and in their mass fury lynched them. The families were enraged at the charge of their boys being cow thieves. \"Would anyone in their right mind set out to steal cows on motor cycles?\" they asked indignantly. But they reported that the police was rough with them. Two of the post-mortems were completed before the families arrived. One was done with the family present. The police then handed over the bodies to the families. The dazed and grieving families spent their own money to transport the bodies to their home before they confined each to their graves. After their deaths, some local politicians came to see them, and some people from the local media. A local politician announced that he was convinced that the men were indeed cow smugglers, without offering any proof. No senior officials, to offer help or solace. One family reported that the local block office gave them some grain and a bag of rice. Nothing else. We found the families in extreme want, with their able-bodied bread earners suddenly lost. The families were desperate to know the truth of who had killed their sons and husbands so viciously, and why. We looked at the papers of the cases, and found that the police had registered cases under Section 304, of culpable homicide not amounting to murder; and not murder under Section 302.  The faces of the killers and a large crowd of onlookers were clearly visible in the video they circulated. But only three men were ultimately arrested, and released on bail in just a fortnight because of the lenient sections of the Indian Penal Code under which they had been charged. The families went in delegations to the police station, but report that they were roughly tuned away without answers. They claim that the police threatened that they too would be locked up if they made too much trouble. The villages planned a gherao surrounding the police station. But a local representative of the panchayat – the same who said the men were cow smugglers - dissuaded them. He said that if they did this, it would anger their Hindu neighbours, and might result in Hindu-Muslim riots. It was wise, their representative advised them, to remain silent to avoid trouble in which in the end only they would suffer. They finally accepted this counsel – whether out of voluntary restraint, or despair. We decided that we should try to get some answers from the police to the grieving families. We took representatives from each of the three families with us to the Chopra Police Station. We waited for an hour before the circle inspector agreed to see us. We told him about the Karwan, and our concerns for the families whose sons had been lynched, that they were entitled to know the progress in the investigations into the lynching. I also asked if charges of murder had at least now been instituted against the killers. He said he would not speak to us until he had the permission of the district superintendent of police. He spoke to his superior in our presence and then replied that he was not authorised to give us any answers at all. I asked heatedly how as a public servant, he could turn away the families of the bereaved families. But he was adamant. We left Bengal intensely troubled about how deep the poison of communal hatred has penetrated even a part of India that has maintained greater communal peace after Partition than most others. The villagers in all the three villages to which we travelled said that apart from stray and minor incidents, there had before this been no major incidents of communal tension and violence between Hindus and Muslims of the area before this. All of this lies shattered after the lynching of the three young men, aggravated first by the charge that they were cow thieves, and then the refusal of the state administration to extend to them solace, support or justice of any kind. This is a failure also that I feel compelled to point to, of local civil liberty groups and progressive and secular political parties. My greatest disappointment was to observe that the attitude of the state administration to the victim families whose loved ones had been felled by hate violence was no different from that of the administrations of BJP ruled states. I could easily instead have been in Gujarat, or Rajasthan, or Uttar Pradesh, and not West Bengal. The betrayal of governments of political parties that claim to be secular in failing to defend their minorities rankles painfully and erodes the secular promises of India’s constitution. Today’s was a journey made even more painful because we made it on the day that the Indian government was celebrating its republic with displays of its military might and cultural pageantry. The despair and fear in the eyes of the members of the three families we met on this day in Bengal villages revealed how hollowed out are the promises of India’s republic to its most vulnerable citizens, and how weakly we all defend these.","date":"2018-01-27","tag":"Congress,BJP,Bengal,Hate crimes","title":"Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018: Lynchings expose the hollowed out promises of India’s republic","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karwan-e-mohabbat-lynchings-hate-crimes-bengal-bjp-congress/story/1/22013.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15297},{"author":"Kartik Mittal","content":"Last year, the powerful Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly announced a diplomatic and economic blockade against another regional pseudo-ally – the state of  . The four countries led the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in accusing Qatar of supporting and funding terrorism and manipulating internal affairs of its neighbouring states. Widely regarded as the most-advanced Arab state for human development by the UN, 85 per cent of the country’s population comprises expatriates, set against just 313,000 Qatari citizens in a population of 2.6 million. Qatar is also a high-income economy, with the world’s third-largest natural-gas reserves and oil reserves. Qatar, which was abruptly shunned by its immediate neighbours, and had little or no indication of the crisis that began as an extension of the Qatar-Saudi proxy conflict. The involvement of the other regional GCC nations, including Bahrain, Egypt and UAE in the blockade further complicated the position to negotiate, as the quartet had a unified and unwavering stance in dedicating the terms for appeasement. The countries cited Qatar's alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for their action, insisting that Qatar has violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the GCC. The GCC also felt threatened by the media arm of Qatar - Al Jazeera - for engaging in what they termed as a \"media conspiracy\" against the nations, and also for the country’s proximity with Iran. Now entering its eight month, the blockade by the GCC nations effectively amounts to economic sanctions on Qatar, which has rendered  , travel, trade and diplomatic restrictions. The effect of these sanctions has been widespread, crippling several companies operating out of the country, and including its citizens and expatriates. The abrupt notice and enforcement of the sanctions had also meant the country was put in a limbo, freezing several of its regional assets and disrupting everyday operations.   As a small gas-rich nation, Qatar has been balancing its trade with heavy dependence on its oil and gas exports for subsidising its food and industrial imports. With its land border with Saudi Arabia closed, Qatar’s food imports initially dropped substantially, before recovering via expensive alternatives. While the allegations against Qatar’s supposed terror-funding has been the prime focal point, in reality, it is also an extension of the regional differences, especially manifested after the network’s coverage since the 2011 Arab Spring. Al Jazeera, the state-funded broadcaster in Doha, was one of the significant nerve-points in the diplomatic blockade, as the GCC members have over the past continued to express distrust over the network’s coverage of the Arab Spring and for “negatively portraying” the local governments. In fact, the complete shutdown of Al Jazeera was one of the terms put forward jointly by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to even commence negotiations. The direct losses incurred by Qatar, along with the indirect losses, would amount to several billion dollars, and the country is already exploring legal avenues to claim compensation from the GCC countries. Several senior ministers have also indicated that Qatar has contracted a specialised legal team to study the actions taken by the blockading countries against it. The country has also been clear in its position on backing Al Jazeera, effectively ruling out any calls for its shutdown.  While the blockade imposed by the GCC is geo-political, efforts by the members in calling for a wider global support, including from the UN is far-fetched. The issue was momentarily complicated when US President Donald Trump took credit for the Saudi-led actions (which was initiated shortly after his visit to the region), but nevertheless it did not gain any traction as international consensus, including from the European Union and the United Nations, among other nations, had called for the resolution of the diplomatic crisis through dialogue. The gas-rich nation has virtually been cornered over its movements - both financially (for its current instruments/investments in the GCC countries) and physically, having to re-rout its land and sea movements via Iran.     Surprisingly, despite all the extreme measures by the GCC quartet to arm-wrestle Qatar, countries, including the UAE and Oman, continue to depend on Qatar’s gas pipeline to power their infrastructure. Qatar continues to pump around two billion cubic feet of gas per day to the UAE, showing no signs of impact from the sanctions.","date":"2018-01-26","tag":"US,Saudi,GCC,Qatar blockade","title":"US-GCC sanctions: One year on, how Qatar is weathering the crisis","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/qatar-blockade-gcc-saudi-us-al-jazeera-donald-trump-arab-spring/story/1/22006.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15298},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"In the most anticipated speech of the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, the last hurrah as it were, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, outlined his idea of America at the globalist platform, asserting that the two are not at odds with each other. Declaring that \"America First\" - the motto of his nationalist government under the Republican party banner - isn't an automatic route to \"America alone\", Trump dispelled some of the widely held fears that he would hijack WEF's overtly internationalist outlook with his nationalist zeal, upsetting the applecart somewhat.   Instead of railing against the transnational order, Trump trained guns at \"predatory trading practices\", saying each country has the right to safeguard its interests. Hinting at the wide-scale off shoring of jobs and manufacturing by American companies over cheap labour and cost, Trump said he has cut corporate taxes to make America \"open for business\" again, something that wasn't being done since the time of Ronald Reagan, Trump's Republican antecedent.  While the tax cuts are being hotly debated in the US national media, concurrent with other policies of the Trump-led White House, such as depleting medical cover for the poor and the middle classes, immigration tightening and strict regulation of previously lenient visa norms such as the H-1B, etc, the US president waxed eloquent about the stock market boom that has followed since the cuts were announced. Trump also spoke of America being a great investment destination, hard-selling his country against a resurgent Europe under the twin leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump also pitched America as an alternative to obvious Asian markets such as India and China. In fact, parts of Trump's speech sounded similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's keynote address at the opening plenary session on January 23, especially the well-oiled business-friendly pitch. While PM Modi had warned against \"protectionism\", Trump sounded a caveat, saying every country has the right to defend itself economically. However, unlike PM Modi, Trump made no reference to climate change, given his high-profile exit from the Paris climate deal in April last year. He touched upon securing America more in terms of defence spendings, as well as saying that the anti-ISIS coalition has wrested almost 100 per cent of the territories once occupied by the Islamic State.  \r\n \r\n President Trump sounded more sober than his usual bombast, though the claims that he made on employment rates among Hispanics, African-Americans and women can be attributed to the policies of the previous Obama administration with its strong affirmative action push. Similarly, the state of the political economy could be gauged from the fact that on the first anniversary of Trump's swearing-in, there was a US government shutdown because the Congress couldn't agree on a federal budget. Not to mention the bad press that Trump is still getting nationally, with some seriously considering if he can be impeached. That said, the expected grouse against \"fake news\" and \"nasty\" media at a global platform was new for the WEF, even though Trump enjoyed a full house, like always. Trump's speech and later interaction with WEF head Klaus Schwab indicate clearly that his anti-immigration policies will continue unabated, making it increasingly difficult for foreign policy experts in India to negotiate a better deal for the expats and NRIs, increasingly courted back home by all political parties. Does Trump's speech ring alarm bells already? Yes, but they are not as loud as we had made them out to be. ","date":"2018-01-26","tag":"United States of America,World Economic Forum 2018,Davos,Donald Trump","title":"'America First' doesn't mean 'America Alone': What Trump said at World Economic Forum","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/donald-trump-davos-world-economic-forum-2018-united-states-of-america/story/1/22009.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15299},{"author":"Amna Mirza","content":"Diplomatic relations with China have always been a thorny issue as far as India's global outreach programmes are concerned, especially in its efforts to reach out to neighbouring countries. At a time when the US, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has been hinting at  , China is trying to take centre stage with its globalisation plans. To understand how this Chinese stance impacts Indian interests, one must look at Beijing's engagement with neighbouring countries. It's an open secret that China is Pakistan's all-weather ally. However, of late, Beijing has been offering submarines to countries along the Indian Ocean coastlines at lucrative prices. Pakistan and China recently announced they will hold joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean regularly. Reports have also surfaced saying China's third domestic aircraft carrier is   in the Indian Ocean. It is pretty evident that Pakistan has consented to self-destruction by agreeing to be a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and trying to bypass the US' strategic encirclement policy that has a military base in Diego Garcia in Indian Ocean and includes the South China Sea. With Pakistan getting loans at exorbitantly high interest rates, imperialist loot and plunder is pretty evident. China has been pretty ruthless in this game of trying to shift the power balance in its own favour. China has invested several billion dollars in building sea lines of communication through Pakistan running far into the Indian Ocean. This is a difficult target to pursue, but that hasn't deterred China from actually going for it. China was critical of the US moving its   in the South China sea, calling it a violation of its sovereignty, and pledged to take necessary measures to protect the same. Beijing took this stand despite the fact that its ships and submarines keep surfacing near Japanese islands, near Taiwan and in the Indian Ocean. China's clout is not restricted to Pakistan, it is growing in the entire Asian region. The country's role in fomenting trouble in Maldives is well-known. Exiled Maldivian Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed termed Chinese property deals in Maldives as \"land grab\". Chinese influence actually stretches to as far as Australia. It is being said that Beijing's rising display of might in South Asia is in response to India's outings in Southeast Asia. It is indeed great that India can work closely with other nations which are joined by the common thread of Chinese aggression in the region. New Delhi can especially draw support from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Even though India has been mindful of the Chinese threat, it needs to shore up greater support given that the challenge from Beijing is growing increasingly formidable.","date":"2018-01-25","tag":"Pakistan,CPEC,Donald Trump,Chinese aggression","title":"India must forge deeper ties with ASEAN nations to counter China in Indian Ocean","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chinese-aggression-donald-trump-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-cpec-maldives-pakistan/story/1/21980.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15300},{"author":"Kaveree Bamzai","content":"That the right wing in India has no sense of history is being proven daily on the streets of cities across India as Karni Sena and its clones threaten the screening of  . They want to ban a movie they have not seen. And they want to protest the depiction of their clan though they do not know details of how it is portrayed. This is in keeping with their lack of knowledge of history. Or rather, as Audrey Truschke points out in an earlier  for  , the skewed colonial history that was taught to us all. As she notes: \"The story of how Aurangzeb became India’s most maligned king begins in the British colonial period. In brief, the British wanted to point to Indian rulers who were even worse than themselves in order to justify the horrors of colonialism. So they painted a skewed picture of Aurangzeb, often misrepresenting his alleged worst crimes. Many Hindu nationalists today think that hating Aurangzeb is a distinctively Indian feeling, but such sentiments are perhaps more aptly described as a colonial inheritance.\" For the right wing, Aurangzeb is seen as the epitome of everything evil. Not only do they see him as a destroyer of temples (though he built more temples than he destroyed), but also as the man who imposed the dreaded jizya tax and disliked music and art. In asking for the boycott of  , the RSS has shown that it is no less than Aurangzeb - they hate the very thing he is said to have abhorred. So, do we become what we hate most? It would seem so. No matter that Aurangzeb's name is sought to be erased by the BJP from Indian history (though he ruled quite successfully for almost half a century) and that no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his name when he spoke disparagingly of Rahul Gandhi recently, he has become the epitome of what a \"bad Muslim\" can be. So, if we are to believe the history that has been taught to us, and is now forwarded through WhatsApps, we should assume the RSS and Karni Sena are Aurangzeb's true heirs. That is also not quite true though - music wasn’t proscribed even in Aurangzeb’s court. The emperor’s own coronation anniversaries were marked by both musicians and dancers. Not only that, his patronisation of music meant that a number of dhrupads were composed in his name. In the  , Bahktawar Khan wrote of the Emperor having a “perfect expert's knowledge” of music. In  , Alauddin Khilji is shown as feeding those pages of history to fire that don't bear his name. If history were to be rewritten to suit those in power, we would have as many versions of it as we have had rulers. Will burning buses and protesting at cinema halls change Rajput history? The irony is that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a film that celebrates every virtue the Rajputs hold dear - including a very emotive sequence at the end when Rani Padmavati leads her army of women into the flames, choosing jauhar over falling into the arms of Khilji. Every community has its own idea of its special status. The Rajputs certainly are entitled to it - and, in fact, the movie celebrates that, with Ratan Singh saying \" ,   Rajput;   Rajput;   Rajput.\" If their objection is that the film portrays a sort of \"love jihad\", they couldn't be more wrong. Arjun Appadurai speaks of the \"fear of small numbers\", the idea that a small minority is standing in the way of a great people from fully embracing their nationalism. It is exactly what is happening here. Khilji's existence is supposed to stand in the way of Rajput's embracing their idea of who they are, or ought to be. Now if that is not a majoritarian mindset, what is?

The National Defence Strategy (NDS) is an important document which encapsulates the Trump administration’s defence policies in one place for the first time. The NDS bluntly describes a US military that is losing its edge over potential competitors, and urges “increased and sustained investment” for “long-term strategic competitions specifically with China and Russia”. The NDS also identifies three theatres of engagement for the US: the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the West Asia that is consistent with what the Obama administration had been doing towards the end. While the NDS specifically points out that “China is a strategic competitor which is using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours while militarising features in the South China Sea”, the document blames Russia of violating the borders of nearby nations and pursuing veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbours. The unclassified synopsis of NDS 2018 acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment, characterised by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations. The NDS states in clear terms about growing Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and states on China \"continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to pursue a military modernization programme that seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future”. The Trump administration had also released its first National Security Strategy (NSS) last month on December 18, 2017. In principle, the strategy which has been outlined in the NSS document charts out the strategic objectives of Trump’s administration and also the ways to meet those strategic aims. The NSS document describes the Indo-Pacific region as the most populous and economically dynamic part of the world and maps it as a stretch from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States and reinforces its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance with international law in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS reflects a growing consensus in the US that China is an adversary. The document is a frank acknowledgment of widely shared concerns about China’s rise. It is important here to note that the approach of Trump administration is a far cry from the Obama administration’s 2015 NSS which had welcomed the rise of a “peaceful” and “prosperous” China. In future, a sharp deterioration of China-US ties cannot be ruled out, especially if Washington perceives Beijing as a hindrance when it comes to resolving the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. The Trump administration’s complaint of China’s bullying of other States using “economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats,” echoes fears spreading from Asia to Europe. In the Indo-Pacific region, as far as New Delhi is concerned, the NSS “welcomes India’s emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic and defence partner”. On the future course of action in the bilateral partnership between the US and India, the document mentions that the US will expand its defence and security cooperation with India which is a major defence partner of the United States, and will also support India’s growing relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific region. There is a specific mention in the document of the much-talked and debated “quadrilateral partnership” among the US, Japan, India and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region, and the NSS puts its stamp on it by mentioning the “Quad” for \"free and open Indo-Pacific\". On the issue of maritime cooperation, Washington has time and again shown its willingness to deepen its strategic partnership with New Delhi and support India’s leadership role in Indian Ocean security and throughout the broader region which is reflective in the cooperation in the Malabar naval exercise. Terrorism in South Asia is one of the biggest challenges among other geopolitical issues and in a direct reference to it, the NSS states that “the US will press Pakistan to intensify the counterterrorism efforts, since no partnership can survive a country’s support for militants and terrorists who target a partner’s own service members and officials”. Overall, the hypothesis of the NSS is based on the principle of realism in international relations as it defines the international system as one of great power competition in which the document specifically points out about Russia and China and portray them as “revisionist powers” challenging the status quo and identifies both the nations as strategic competitors or opponents of the United States. The NSS also criticises past several decades of US foreign policy approach and points out that in past it was shaped by the misguided belief that \"engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners\". This kind of realist framework in the conceptual context needs to be welcomed because it was long overdue departure from previous and successive administrations of the US. Interestingly, the NSS neither makes any mention of China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative nor mentions about the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together has the potential for a parallel Sino-centric sphere of influence in future. The US needs to shed its obsession with zero-sum trade reciprocity and should come out with a coherent and comprehensive geo-economics strategy if it wants to preserve the US-led rules-based order and counter China’s grand strategy to carve out a parallel Sino-centric order or sphere of influence.  ","date":"2018-01-25","tag":"Defence deals,India-US Ties,US defence strategy","title":"What Trump's new national defence and security strategies mean for India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/us-national-defence-strategy-security-india-us-ties-defence-trump-obama-administration/story/1/21979.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15302},{"author":"Minhaz Merchant","content":"The   between the chief justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and four Supreme Court collegium justices - J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph - gets curiouser by the day. Despite several meetings to reconcile their differences, the gulf between India’s seniormost justices has not narrowed. What precisely are those differences? At their press conference and in their seven-page letter, the four collegium justices were vague in their demands. For those who want linguistic clarity and brevity from our finest judicial minds, the letter gives little indication of either. Sample this: “ But if all Supreme Court justices are equals, why shouldn’t cases, sensitive or not, be assigned to benches led by “junior” Supreme Court judges? No clear answer has been forthcoming. So what do the four rebel justices really want? First, they want the case relating to the death of judge BH Loya reassigned. That wish has been fulfilled. Justice Arun Mishra was hearing the Loya case. Rattled by the events of last week, he recused himself. The CJI, in a show of authority, reassigned the case to a bench headed by himself. He was under relentless pressure to reassign the Loya case to a bench headed by one of the four collegium justices. He did not. Instead, he even transferred the two PILs related to the case pending in the Bombay High Court to his own bench. Last week, the petitioners’ senior counsel Dushyant Dave had pleaded “with folded hands” against the CJI doing that. The CJI brushed aside Dave’s plea. A group of lawyers and politicians are using the  , as they had earlier used the  , to target BJP president Amit Shah. The confrontation between the Maharashtra government’s counsel Harish Salve and Dave in the CJI’s court on January 22, brought this out into the open. Dave claimed that Salve had defended Shah in the past and should not appear in the Loya case due to conflict of interest. The charge was summarily rejected by the CJI’s three-judge bench.   Salve has, meanwhile, submitted medical documents and other material to the Supreme Court to show that judge Loya’s death occurred due to natural causes. The CJI has posted the next hearing in the case for February 2. But amid the judge Loya clamour, the case that lurks in the background is about building the  . Like Banquo’s ghost that haunted Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Ram temple case haunts the Supreme Court. The long drawn-out case is now with a bench headed by the CJI. He retires on October 2, 2018. There is an expectation that the CJI wants to deliver a verdict in the case before he demits office. The same powerful group of lawyers, activists, politicians and sections of the media that has shown exceptional interest in the judge Loya case fears that the CJI could be inclined to rule in favour of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque stood. Such a ruling would benefit the BJP in three big states due to go to the polls in December 2018: Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. All three states will feature binary BJP-Congress contests. All three face strong anti-incumbency. A pro-temple ruling would give the BJP a steroid boost ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.  Two outcomes can now be divined. First, a chastened CJI, buffeted by the collegium’s rebellion, will postpone a verdict on the Ram temple case till after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, citing its sensitivity. Second, the CJI could rule against  building the Ram temple where the Babri mosque stood and instead suggest the construction of two new structures, a temple and a mosque, side by side. That would suit the Opposition ahead of 2019. All of these well-laid plans though may amount to nothing. Even if the Supreme Court’s verdict goes against building the Ram temple, or the verdict is inordinately delayed, the anger that it will spark among devout Hindus will be electorally fissile. In the end, therefore, the elaborate shenanigans we have been witness to in the Supreme Court over the past two weeks could end in a whimper. But the spotlight it has shone on the apex court and its hallowed innards will have served a purpose.  Why, for example, haven’t the senior justices of the Supreme Court shown similar ire, as they have over assignment of cases, against the real issues that bedevil India’s judicial system: deep-seated corruption, shambolic infrastructure, a mounting backlog of cases, lawyers holding clients to ransom with adjournments, and the opaque collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court by other Supreme Court judges? Such opacity hardly inspires confidence in India’s top judicial minds as they wrestle with the fissure within their ranks and Banquo’s ghost that hovers silently over the unbuilt Ram temple in Ayodhya.","date":"2018-01-24","tag":"Amit Shah,Modi,Elections,Ram mandir","title":"Why Ram temple issue is lurking behind crisis in Supreme Court","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-judge-loya-ram-mandir-2019-modi-amit-shah-congress/story/1/21953.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15303},{"author":"Aruna Chandrasekhar","content":"Given the surreal times that we live in, it's always reassuring to hear world leaders reaffirm that climate change is still real for them. This time it was   at Davos, acknowledging climate change as one of the biggest threats to the world as we know it.  It was a statement in keeping with India's strong positioning as a climate leader and doing more than it should. But that we are bending over backwards to set ambitious climate goals - given our history as being a site of colonial pillage - is a point I wish he drove home without constantly having to bring yoga into it.  Sustainable lifestyles make for great soft power sell at Davos, but not when you are the world's second-largest coal consumer and third-largest emitter, with a capital that's not particularly conducive to \"pranayama\". In his speech, Modi spoke of glaciers and ice-caps melting. I wish he'd spoken of the impacts closer home -  , caught off guard by  , agrararian suicides in a year where average rainfall dropped five per cent and devastating floods that took over a thousand lives in the sub-continent. Modi's speech is also dangerously disingenuous. Just last month, as air quality readings peaked across the country, his government   to duck installing essential pollution control technology for another five years. Over 200 coal projects - many of them greenfield - still lie on the top of his office's  . It was only because of a case filed by air pollution activist Sunil Dahiya that    have been put on hold, unless they comply with new emission norms. Dahiya is a campaigner with Greenpeace, an organisation the present government has relentlessly persecuted for calling out the excesses of coal culture. Modi's call for rich nations to do their bit and arguments against protectionism struck the right notes, as developed countries must demonstrate they can put their money where their mouth is, beginning with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol which turned 20 last year. India deserves, and is due to all, the finance and technology in helping it fulfil its most daring gigwatt goals, and to build climate adaptation capacity. But this must be finance that is easy to access. To win a project under  , for instance, is nearly impossible, making one wonder what Make In India the government is hoping to seed fund from its unique carbon tax. While the international press saw Modi's protectionism diatribe as directly   America-centricism - the latest being a 30 per cent tariff imposed on foreign-made solar cells and modules - the Indian government is currently mulling imposing one, putting Operation Suryanamaskar's success in peril. For Modi to invoke Mahatma Gandhi's spin on natural resources while making an elevator pitch at Davos was a stretch even by his standards. For one, his government's continued expansion of Coal India's mines towards a 1.5 billion target has been the opposite of the kid-glove-meets-swadeshi kind of trusteeship,   to forcibly grab indigenous land, while  that allow for local trustees to have any say in the matter. Two, his government's coal auction regime has not been a vast improvement, with ghosts of cartelisation returning, conflicts around land and pollution that were never   and mines unable to get off the ground. Instead, contract mining has become the default way to go, with the state taking on the bidding and regulatory prep work, while private miners like the   rake in the profits without the exposure. By the looks of it, neither   nor   have benefitted the least from three and a half years of Modi's custodianship. If Modi really wants Davos and the world to believe in India taking the lead on climate change, he needs to shed his telling proximity to the fossil fuel industry, acknowledge and fix the haze at home, announce the no-go zones in India's forests and wetland buffers, strengthen laws that empower communities with the lowest carbon footprint and make clean energy R&D accessible, without doing away with essential laws and protections.  All else is \"pawanmuktasana\" for the international press.","date":"2018-01-24","tag":"India,Climate change,Davos,PM Modi","title":"Why Prime Minister Modi's talk of climate change in Davos was hogwash","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/davos-pm-modi-climate-yoga-change-pollution-trump-indias-coal-culture-clean-energy/story/1/21948.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15304},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"Uddhav Thackeray was searching for a “villain” he could blame for the Shiv Sena’s decision to go solo in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He found one in the form of BJP national president Amit Shah. Thackeray claims that Shah sidelined the other constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) while setting a target of 380 seats for the next Lok Sabha election. “Why the astonishment over Shiv Sena’s stand to go solo in the elections?” Thackeray asked in party mouthpiece   on January 24. Thackeray compares the Shiv Sena with the army of Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji: “The Maratha warrior didn’t worry about the vast empires of the Muslim rulers, their unlimited sources of wealth even though he himself didn’t have enough money to pay his army men.” However, it seems he has not taken lessons from Shivaji’s guerrilla war tactics. True to his impulsive nature, Thackeray has revealed his strategy much before the country can go into the election mode. He has given the BJP ample time to formulate its strategy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election without his party’s support. Interestingly, it was the BJP that had kept Thackeray in the dark about the future of their alliance when the former had unilaterally announced a break up two days before the nomination for Assembly polls began in September 2014. “A mature leader never lets his rivals know his strategy much in advance. Uddhavji should have waited for some time,” says a Shiv Sena leader. Voters will not trust Thackeray’s intention to take on the BJP until he proves his credibility by quitting the coalition government. His criticism regarding the government’s failure on issues like loan waiver to farmers will not carry weight till he remains a key player of the government. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have begun chiding him for sticking to power rather than dismantling the alliance. Traditionally, the Thackerays are not known to be open-hearted. Shiv Sena workers are not sure whether they will get monetary support from the party for their work during elections. Around six months ago, the Shiv Sena had fielded Tanaji Sawant, a wealthy Mumbai-based businessman, in the Legislative Council elections from the faraway Yavatmal constituency, declining loyal but poor workers the opportunity to contest polls. Sawant secured a comfortable victory that upset party loyalists. Bring this into the equation, and it is highly possible Thackeray will choose candidates with money instead of those who have been toiling for the party for many years. Ordinary Shiv Sena workers have gone into political hibernation since Thackeray joined the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in December 2014. The chief does not have any programme to infuse enthusiasm into them. The moment any Shiv Sena worker expresses his dissent over the functioning of the government, a patent question is thrown at him: why is he complaining if he is a part of the government? The Shiv Sainiks have been caught in a Catch-22 situation. They feel they are in the government but the BJP has ensured that they do not get any benefit of the power. Thackeray will have to come up with a detailed roadmap to revive the party — at present, he does not have any. Thackeray has announced that Shiv Sena will contest elections in every state on the Hindutva plank. The ground reality, however, paints no rosy picture. In Maharashtra, north Indians and Gujaratis will vote for the BJP on the Hindutva plank as the Shiv Sena has time and again taken a hard stand against these communities. For north Indians, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is a bigger Hindutva icon than Thackeray. The Gujaratis do not consider anyone Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s equal — he remains the biggest Hindutva idol. The Marathi-speaking voters, on the other hand, will rally behind the Shiv Sena as they are divided in other parties — BJP, Congress and the NCP. It is important to note that Hindutva supporters disapprove of Thackeray’s growing closeness with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee whom they consider anti-Hindutva owing to her politics of appeasement. The Shiv Sena is not a dominant force outside the Konkan and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra. In Mumbai, it will have a close contest with the BJP should the two parties fight the polls separately. Thackeray has failed to take Shiv Sena to new heights in western Maharashtra, north Maharashtra and Vidarbha, the regions where half of the Assembly seats are consolidated. Uddhav’s decision to go solo in the election is certainly aimed at energising depressed Shiv Sena workers, but it will not get him sweeping power. Who will he blame then?","date":"2018-01-24","tag":"Shiv Sena,Lok Sabha elections 2019,Uddhav Thackeray,Maharashtra","title":"Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to go without BJP in 2019 general elections will be disastrous","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uddhav-thackeray-shiv-sena-lok-sabha-elections-2019-maharashtra/story/1/21949.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15305},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"The   could well be mistaken for the latest season of \"MasterChef Karnataka\". What else explains the obsession of both the Congress and the BJP to reduce the political battle to all things culinary? At a time when the man on the street is grappling with bread and butter issues, the political cooks are serving him beef biryani instead. The B-word was introduced into the Kannada electoral lexicon by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who many in the BJP believe is the man who could ensure distribution of laddoos on verdict day in May 2018. He slammed his Karnataka counterpart Siddaramaiah, mocking his Hindu self, deriding his choice to   despite his religious identity. The Congress hit back with a video that spoke of how Yogi is a recipe that the BJP has prepared to stir trouble in Karnataka. The video made references to the criminal cases against Yogi and the BJP was not amused. Plagiarism is the name of the game so a week later, the BJP too chose the same culinary metaphor to show Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao as chefs, out to prepare beef biryani. The ingredients in this case, according to the makers of the video, included \"illegal beef from a slaughterhouse\", \"rotten rice\" given as part of the PDS, the inability to solve the Cauvery and Mahadayi river water sharing crisis, killings of Hindu youths and alleged corruption in the building of a steel flyover in Bengaluru. But the real reason behind calling it \"beef biryani\" was to stress the appeasement of the minorities under Siddaramaiah. On Monday, the Congress beefed up its rhetoric by expanding the BJP to \"Beef Janata Party\", inspired from Gabbar Singh Tax, perhaps. The attempt was to expose the hypocrisy of the BJP which adopts different positions on consumption of beef in different states. For example, while it does not breathe a word about its anti-beef position in a beef-consuming Meghalaya that goes to polls next month, it wants to put the Congress on the mat in Karnataka by making it a poll issue. The video also spoke of Goa that under BJP's Manohar Parrikar wants to import beef and UP's BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who reportedly runs a meat processing unit. The reason for the BJP raising the decibel levels over its love for the cow goes back five years, when the party was in power in Karnataka. In 2010, the then BJP government had passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill. Siddaramaiah, then in the Opposition had dramatically torn a copy of the Bill, accusing Yeddyurappa of behaving like \"Hitler's regime\" and \"imposing a vegetarian\" culture on the people of Karnataka. His argument was that by banning beef, mutton would become prohibitive. Three years later, when Siddaramaiah became CM, one of his first decisions was to overturn the beef ban. The 1964 Cattle Preservation Act was restored under which slaughter of cows, calves and buffaloes was banned. The Yeddyurappa Bill had banned the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and imposed harsh punishments for violators of the law. By making beef a poll issue, the BJP wants to jog the memory of voters on Siddaramaiah's conduct, hoping to sway the vegetarian Kannadiga and the orthodox Hindu on to its side. This is because even while standing his ground on his right to decide what food will be on his plate, Siddaramaiah has emphasised that he is  . \"There is both Siddha and Rama in my name,'' he declared, raising the spectre of a Gujarat-like temple run in Karnataka by the Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. The Congress, having seen the results of running a Hindu-ised Gujarat campaign, wants to ensure the BJP does not pitch its tent as the sole spokesperson of the Hindus in Karnataka. The BJP's assessment is that controversial planks like beef ban will find traction in pockets of Karnataka, especially the communally sensitive coastal belt. The intention also is to provoke the Muslim voices in the Congress to speak up, so that it will give the BJP a chance to label the ruling party as batting solely for the minorities. So far, the Congress has ensured it does not fall into the trap, trying instead to pick holes in the BJP's policy of different strokes in different states. But what is certain is that the beef recipe will only bring a divisive election on the menu and that won't do Karnataka any good.","date":"2018-01-23","tag":"Congress,BJP,Beef Ban,Karnataka elections","title":"BJP vs Congress: Who will get the beef recipe right in Karnataka polls?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-siddaramaiah-yogi-adityanath-beef-ban-bjp-congress/story/1/21918.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15306},{"author":"Valay Singh Rai","content":"At a dimly lit internet cafe in one of the several urban villages of Delhi, two Class 12 students, sporting latest hairstyles and faux designer labels, are getting their school projects printed. Sushant’s submission is on the Goods and Services Tax (GST); his friend Sumit struggles to translate his project title into English. The irritable cafe owner is in a hurry to move on to his other customers. “Write the title in Hindi -   (the crisis of unemployment),” Sumit tells him.  The boys study in a government school in south Delhi’s Swamy Nagar, a posh neighbourhood that houses many of the 1 per cent Indians who have come to acquire 73 per cent of the wealth generation in India in 2017. The boys on the other hand belong to the 14-18 years age group that constitute 11 per cent (100.2 million) of India’s population of 1.2 billion people. They form a huge chunk of our much-touted (and neglected) demographic dividend of 390 million millennials and the 12 million young people who join the workforce every year. A week ago, the   (ASER) was released by Pratham. Titled \"Beyond Basics\", the latest report is a welcome departure from the past as it looks at rural youth in 14-18 age group, through the lenses of - activity, ability, awareness, and aspirations. Earlier, ASER reports have brought out in stark detail the poor learning levels of children in the schooling system. It is thanks to this annual survey, we now know that while school enrolment has gone up to more than 95 per cent, learning levels of children in government schools are woeful. Most Class 3 students are unable to Class 2-level text. The findings of \" \" are a stinging slap to policymakers and state governments of the 24 states that formed part of the    The worst indictment is for the union government, which has been stubbornly resisting the extension of the Right to Education Act from 14 years to 18 years.  So far, only primary school education in India is a legal right, which is why primary school enrolments have shot up to more than 90 per cent. Groups like the   have been demanding that secondary school education should also be made a legal right as most children tend to \"drop out\" after Class 8. The latest survey confirms once again that the urgent need is to make the entire 12 years of schooling a legal right. The survey has thrown up worrisome trends that belie the media frenzy over Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India, and Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat. Consider this: Out of 100 children in Class 7 only half of them continue to study till Class 10. And only 25 per cent of them go on to complete Class 12. Less than 10 per cent of the youth surveyed in the \"Beyond Basics\" report were enrolled in undergraduate or other degree courses. Nearly 30 per cent of all youth are not enrolled in either a school or any other educational course. The prime minister, who is in   to tell the world’s business tycoons that \"India means business\" ought to bear in mind the complete failure of his government’s Skill India programme. According to the ASER report, only 5 per cent of youth are \"taking some type of vocational training or other courses\". Just 5 per cent. That’s less than the proportion of such youth in Sri Lanka and Nepal, leave alone the rest of the world. For the RSS and its supporters, the ancient golden age of \"Bharat\" is an ever-present model to attract ordinary Indians to their fold. \"India will once again become the world’s teacher\" - this promise is often heard from RSS men, BJP leaders and ministers alike. While a lie can possibly be turned into truth by repeating it ad nauseam, the same doesn’t hold true for grand promises. Last year, the central government  . This month, the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE) once again stalled the demand for the extension of the RTE Act. Moreover, there is a shortage of 9.4 lakh teachers in government schools where the poorest children study. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, only half of all secondary school teacher posts have been filled. In Bihar and Gujarat, one third of them are vacant. Among the other alarming findings of the ASER report is the abysmal \"awareness\" level of India’s rural youth. Less than half of them were unable to locate their own state on the map. Only 64 per cent of them knew that Delhi is India’s capital and nearly 14 per cent of them didn’t recognise India’s map. The prime minister, especially believes in the power of apps and internet, but again, the bulk of India’s youth are deprived of access to the new knowledge-based economy. The   says that  only \"28 per cent had used the internet and 26 per cent had used computers in the last week, while 59 per cent had never used a computer and 64 per cent had never used internet\". If we divide this on the basis of gender, we find that girls are lagging in internet usage also. The report found that, “while 49 per cent  of males have never used the internet, close to 76 per cent of females have never done so”. The proportion of mobile phone users was predictably higher at 73 per cent for all youth, here too more females (22 per cent) had never used a mobile phone as compared to males (12 per cent). If a \"Beyond Basics\" kind of survey is conducted among the youth who scaled the court complex in Udaipur and planted a saffron flag in the wake of the gruesome communal murder of migrant labourer Afrazul, the results are likely to be in consonance with the general findings of the actual report. Incidentally, Udaipur was the only district where the survey was conducted in Rajasthan. The findings for Udaipur are depressing, 96.8 per cent of the youth surveyed were not enrolled in any vocational course, less than half of them could do basic arithmetic, or recognise their own state on the map of India. This pattern repeats itself across different states. The crux of the ASER survey is clear. Most of India’s youth are uneducated, deprived of access to skills of the future, and live in abject hopelessness. In the absence of free and compulsory education till Class 12, many of the rural youth are forced to discontinue their education over reasons ranging from death in the family to the wedding of a sibling even as education is prioritised over practically everything in middle class Indian families. The whole family works in mission mode to ensure that their children ace their competitive exams and join a professional course, while the laggards make up by buying seats in colleges. On the other hand, in the other India which lives in villages and small towns, the youth lives in a deep and dark well which is illuminated by TV and mobile phones. In the absence of role models (40 per cent said they have none), their lives are a dark vacuum which can be easily filled by destructive, if not exhilarating purposes. The demographic dividend is real and inevitable, but are we as a country prepared to constructively engage the youth is the question that should be bothering our government? Because if the government continues to look at school education as business as usual, and ignore education, skills and employability of the future Indian workforce, then the demographic dividend will surely turn into a demographic disaster.","date":"2018-01-23","tag":"RTE,Modi,Demographic dividend,ASER report","title":"India's demographic dividend is turning into a disaster","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-demographic-dividend-aser-education-slap-davos-skill-india-rte/story/1/21919.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15307},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"When he was inducted into the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government in 2014, Chandrakant Patil was considered a man for all seasons because of his ability to handle a number of issues besides his clean image. Three and a half years later, the revenue minister has become the epitome of goof-ups and misplaced priorities. Most recently, Patil found himself at the centre of controversy when he recited a Kannada song praising Karnataka, where he attended the inauguration of a Durga temple in Belgaum district. Patil opened his speech with \"Huttidare Kannada Nadalli Huttabeku (roughly translated as \"One should be born in Karnataka if one is born at all\")\". As expected, the Opposition is demanding Patil’s head for “insulting Maharashtra in Karnataka”. The controversy assumes political relevance owing to Maharashtra's long-pending border dispute with Karnataka. Belgaum is the centrepoint of the chorus for the demand for the merger of Karnataka’s Marathi-speaking border areas with Maharashtra. Patil has effectively given the Opposition an opportunity to target the state government for its “double standards” over the decades-old issue. “We were aware of the BJP’s affection for Gujarat. Now, it has developed love for Karnataka. Chandrakant Patil has stabbed the people of Maharashtra in the back,” said Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar. He even asked for the minister's resignation in a tweet. \r\n \r\n Patil has become a habitual offender when it comes to breaking Marathi hearts. Only two weeks ago, he had raised questions over the competence of BJP workers in the state. Speaking at a conclave of teachers in Beed, Patil had said it had become difficult to find leaders of character for various important posts in the party. “We won’t find such people even if we look for them with binoculars,” he had said, in an apparent dig at \"incompetent\" BJP workers. He had also found himself in a spot in October 2017 when he provided wrong information about the ownership of two flats in the possession of state Congress president Ashok Chavan’s daughters – Shrijaya and Sujaya. While he has apologised to BJP workers over his remarks in Beed, Patil clarified that he spoke in Kannada recently as the native audience could grasp only that language.  The goof-ups are likely to hamper his political career, considered bright till a couple of months ago. A smear campaign has already been conducted within the BJP to curtail Patil’s phenomenal political growth. He was an office-bearer at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Kolhapur office till 2010, when the BJP inducted him full time and made him contest the legislative council election from the graduates’ constituency. Patil secured a comfortable victory but kept a low profile, following his Sangh ideals. His stature in the party started growing since Amit Shah became BJP's national president. Both of them share very good relations since Shah’s wife comes from Patil’s hometown Kolhapur. Patil has had close ties with Shah’s in-laws since his days in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in late '80s. He became number two in the Fadnavis Cabinet following the ouster of then revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who was the party's most senior face. On at least three occasions, when there were speculations over Fadnavis being replaced as the CM, Patil emerged as a frontrunner for the coveted post. First, it was the outcry of the Maratha community demanding reservation in education and government jobs. Later, the unprecedented agitation by farmers demanding a better price for their produce and, recently, the protests by Dalits following clashes at Bhima Koregaon on January 1 made Patil feel that he stood a chance to lead Maharashtra in the event Fadnavis is asked to step down for “mishandling” the crisis. It created the impression that Patil, a Maratha, could succeed Fadnavis, a Brahmin. The situation has rapidly changed and an impulsive Patil alone is responsible for that. He has become the target of detractors within the BJP. A source in the party claims that a whispering campaign has been engineered over Patil’s caste. Some have started circulating a message that says Patil is a Jain not a Maratha. It points out that there are many Jains in western Maharashtra, especially in Kolhapur and Sangli, who carry Marathi surnames like Patil. That Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, the founder of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, a major education trust in Sangli, was a Jain. The message asks what Chandrakant Patil has done for the welfare of Maratha students as the head of a committee constituted to deal with issues pertaining to the community, such as reservation and scholarships. If the message is an indication, it is the beginning of the decline of Patil’s influence.","date":"2018-01-23","tag":"BJP,Maharashtra,Chandrakant Patil","title":"Why Chandrakant Patil is facing the heat in Maharashtra BJP","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrakant-patil-kannada-belgaum-devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-bjp-rss/story/1/21920.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15308},{"author":"Subhash Kak","content":"There was an outcry in the Indian media last week when  , minister of state for human resource development, reportedly said: \"Darwin's theory (of evolution) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on earth, he has always been a man.\" He was speaking to reporters in Aurangabad at the All India Vaidik Sammelan. He reportedly added: \"Nobody - including our ancestors - has said they saw an ape turning into a man. No books we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had such a mention.\" Indian scientists are shocked that the minister should speak thus against the idea of evolution which is fundamental to biology and medicine. How can the HRD minister be so ill-informed about science? This is all the more puzzling since he was a senior police officer before entering politics. Was the minister merely trying to be nice to the traditionalists at the Vaidik Sammelan, and he has no strong views on the matter, and perhaps the HRD ministry is safe under his leadership? My own thinking is that he is genuinely misinformed because, in reality, the idea of evolution (more general than Darwinian Evolution) is basic to all Indian thought, which is something that he does not appear to know. The least he can do is to understand both modern evolution theory and Indian ideas on it and then see how the education system in India can help people know the history of Indian ideas as well as the foundations of modern science. The Sankhya is the Indian theory of evolution, which is supposed to apply both to the individual and the cosmos. In it, the basic entities are pure consciousness and materiality (nature). Nature has three constituent qualities (gunas) called sattva, rajas, and tamas, and as the balance between these three changes the universe evolves. Out of the interplay of the five basic elements arise other principles (tattva): five subtle elements, five action senses, five senses of perception, mind, egoity, and intellect. The evolutionary sequence goes through many levels. The tattvas help in the emergence of life out of inert matter. The gu?as are not to be taken as abstract principles alone. Indian thought believes that structure in nature is recursive, and the gu?as show up in various forms at different levels of expression. The texts imply that ingredients for the growth of life are available throughout the universe. Infinite number of universes are conceived, so each new one is created like a bubble in an ocean of bubbles. The tattvas are not discrete and their varying expression creates the diversity of life in and across leading different species. Each sensory and motor tattva is mapped into a corresponding organ. Indian thought conceives of 8.4 million species, which is an impressive number, considering modern authorities estimate the number of extant species to be 4.5-10 million. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger thought that the S?nkhyan tattvas were the most plausible model for the evolution of the sensory organs. A quote on evolution on earth from the thousand-year-old, encyclopedic Yoga Vasistha (YV): Indicating the presence of other animals while the giant asuras were on earth, YV suggests that man arose later. YV also speaks of minor ages of destruction on earth that correspond to the yugas. The Indians believed that all life can be divided into three classes (Chandogya Upanishad 6.3.1): \"In truth, beings have here three kinds of seeds, born from the egg, born alive, and born from the germ.\" Given that it is also affirmed that life on other planets exists and that there was a gradual rise of life on the earth, it would appear that this implied a belief in a panspermia theory. Why aren't Indian ideas on evolution known to educated Indians? We see that Satyapal Singh did not need to deny evolution just to be on the right side of the remembered Indian tradition. The question then is: Why are the minister and other Indians ill-informed about their own sciences? India is the only major nation where history of science is not integrated in the school and college curriculum. People pick up bits and pieces on it from a variety of sources, such as tangential references in religious texts, and other sources many of which are unreliable or plain wrong. Superstitions arise in the absence of right knowledge and sunlight dispels darkness. A course on history of Indian science in colleges and universities will go a long way in presenting Indian scientific ideas to the next generation, and help people distinguish scientific ideas from mythology and fiction. The history of Indian science is not a politically divisive issue as it is not teaching religion or ritual. Why can't the HRD ministry take leadership on this issue?","date":"2018-01-22","tag":"Chandogya Upanishad,Scientific thought,Human evolution,Satyapal Singh","title":"What Hindu tradition says about evolution","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/satyapal-singh-human-evolution-apes-scientific-thought-chandogya-upanishad/story/1/21888.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15309},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"The Supreme Court on Friday decided that the judgment given in the Mahmood Farooqui case by the Delhi High Court is a  . The top court, comprising a bench of justices SA Bobde and L Nageshwar Rao,   of the American scholar against the high court judgment which acquitted Farooqui of rape charges, on the first hearing itself. While acquitting Farooqui, the Delhi High Court had controversially said, \"Sometimes a feeble no, means yes.\" There was much hope pinned on the apex court when the matter reached its door. In a hearing that lasted about 20 minutes, some observations and questions raised by the Supreme Court bench were deeply troubling. Here is a short account of the hearing because I was present in the courtroom: It began with the bench pointing out how the two (Farooqui and the woman) weren't strangers to each other. Justice Bobde observed, \"She knows him [Farooqui] well enough to make a drink for him.\" The bench went on to question the lawyer, \"How many times did the complainant visit the house of Farooqui alone.\" The court referred to an earlier incident when the complainant and Farooqui kissed despite the presence of Farooqui's wife in the house. The bench mistakenly thought that the incident is of the same day, but advocate Vrinda Grover informed that the instance of kissing did not happen on the day of the incident. The bench went into a discussion on whether the complainant faked an orgasm which could have led Farooqui to believe that she gave her consent. The bench asked: \"So, how did she communicate that she didn't have the  ? The lawyer responded by saying that the complainant said no several times. The judge interjected by saying, \"Initially yes, but later there is a response wherein she says she faked (orgasm). People give fake smiles all the time. But how could the alleged accused know it was fake. She said she was afraid but what she did was completely contrary to someone who would be afraid.\" The court insisted Vrinda Grover read the email written by the complainant to the accused after the incident, which talks about how the complainant felt her sexual autonomy is violated, how Farooqui became forceful and how she \"went along\" because she was scared. The complainant also told Farooqui how his behaviour was inappropriate and went on to say, \"I love you and wish well for you but..\" The court picked on this line: \"Ms Grover in how many cases have you seen the victim saying I love you to the accused.\" The lawyer tried to explain how it happens in cases where parties have known each other and victims are still coming to terms with their trauma. The court dismissed the plea. There are two grounds on which the court primarily dismissed the appeal against the high court judgment. The first was whether the absence of consent was properly communicated to Mahmood Farooqui as the parties were known to each other and had a history of kissing each other. The apex court seems to believe that because the complainant faked an orgasm towards the end of the sexual activity, it gave the defendant a presumption of consent. This argument is flawed. First, if the complainant had repeatedly   when the sexual activity began then faking an orgasm at the end cannot be conclusive proof that she consented. Consent in law is understood as the ability and freedom to make choices. The victim says she feared for her safety hence she \"went along\". This issue was dealt with in case of Doyle (2010) by the Court of Appeal in UK. The court came to the conclusion that the fact that the victim \"just let him get on with it\" was held to be no consent as there was a fear of harm. In this case one can argue that the fear of harm was not immediate. Most common law countries follow this proposition. One can of course debate whether the threat of harm was immediate or imminent or whether the complainant was reasonable in holding such a belief. But the mere faking of an orgasm towards the end cannot be conclusive for Farooqui to reach the conclusion that she consented. Let's move to the aspect of the proximity or the relationship between the parties. Both knew each other and had exchanged kisses earlier. But the past sexual conduct cannot be at any stage adduced as evidence for consent unless it can be directly established that it impinges upon the right of fair trial for the defendant. The test for adducing the evidence of past sexual conduct is pretty high even under the Indian law. It cannot be brought forth in ordinary circumstances, at least the law doesn't say so. In such a scenario for the bench to make observations like \"she knew him well enough to make a drink for him\" or \"how many times she visited the house alone\" raise some disturbing questions. I wonder, whether the sexuality of a woman continues to be on trial. The bench did clarify that they were not implying that making a drink or visiting someone's house gives one the right to rape, but having such questions is in itself problematic in a deeply violent and patriarchal society. The language used in a rape trial is an important component in the entire process of delivery of justice. At no point did the court delve into the fact that the defendant was intoxicated. Was he capable of understanding the verbal and non-verbal cues of the complainant? Why wasn't the conduct of the defendant who was arguably in a position of trust not questioned at any point? Now to the second and more disturbing aspect, which is of the email sent on March 30, 2015, two days after the incident. It is true that the complainant does say that \"I love you…\" but here is the full text of that email:  (Source: Judgment of Delhi HC). Few days later, on April 12, 2015, the complainant writes another mail which literally abuses Farooqui for the trauma and pain and how the experience has been haunting her ever since. These mails should be understood in the proper context. This is an account of a woman who is still coming to terms with what has happened with her. As women, we often deny our realities unless they start haunting us. This is very well documented especially in cases where the victim and offender have known each other. The words \"I love you\" should not be misconstrued without proper context and understanding. This is not about a lawyer weighing her each and every words, imagining this to be used as evidence in court, but rather a woman who is finding it difficult to accept the reality in the wake of a saexual assault. Eventually it is for the courts to decide whether there was consent or not and yes the case of Farooqui is a difficult one. But the case has to be dismissed or admitted for the right reasons and in cases of sexual assault one can't ignore the language of it. The language is as important as the substance.","date":"2018-01-22","tag":"Consent,Mahmood Farooqui case,Supreme Court,Sexual assault","title":"How the courts failed in interpreting consent in Mahmood Farooqui rape case","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mahmood-farooqui-case-consent-sexual-assault-orgasm-supreme-court/story/1/21891.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15310},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for Davos to attend and address the  , the annual meeting in praise of global capital and globalisation, of reading the world as an interconnected place of interlocked economies and nations – seems poised at a cliffhanger. With the one-of-a-kind American president in Donald J Trump, whose protectionist   motto is exactly the opposite of what WEF has stood for, there’s bound to be “clashes”, if not among personalities, at least among competing ideas at the forum in the snow-clad Swiss Alps, despite the   on the mountains, thanks to India. With both Modi and Trump scheduled to give keynote addresses – Modi at the opening plenary session on   and Trump on the last day,   – it seems the organisers have tried their best to avoid awkwardness, and any hijacking of the forum by Trump with his anti-globalist ideas. While there have been protests against WEF by the anti-globalisation activists of the left, environmentalists, anti-capitalists from Europe and Latin America, the concern about Trump is unique, since it’s the US president this time, usually a force of globalisation and undeterred flow of global capital, who is spewing policies and ideas that are clearly in the “far-right” of the socioeconomic spectrum. On the other hand, despite immense criticism at home, Prime Minister Modi, who’s the first Indian PM to make an official trip to Davos after two decades since former   went in 1997, stands for pitching India as a global investment destination, even though it’s not going to be the easiest of tasks. With the investment-to-GDP ratio dipping at home, and the economic indicators that were paraded by the government, such as the   and the World Bank  , both having faced  , thereby stealing Modi’s thunder somewhat with hard data, the task has become more uphill. In fact, India is that rare big emerging economy that has seen its  , while the world economy as such showed a healthy upward swing, 10 years since the 2008 Wall Street crash. This has been attributed to the twin economic shocks – demonetisation and GST – and PM Modi will have a hard time explaining the counter-trend in India as opposed to the global upswing. This means at the World Economic Forum, which is hosting 2,500 delegates including several heads of states or elected premiers, along with 120 global CEOs, Modi and Trump would be doing the opposite jobs. While Modi will be looking for more FDI – it’s significant that 100 per cent   via automatic route has been sanctioned just before the WEF 2018 – and “hard-selling India” as a brilliant investment destination, Trump will be selling his America First policies to retain most of the CEOs who happen to be Americans, to pick the United States over emerging economies with huge markets such as India and China. With business heads, prime ministers and presidents of countries, academicians, philanthropists, environmentalists, Silicon Valley honchos, human rights activists and members from art and cinema all descending on Davos for the WEF, it’ll be the usual potpourri of intense debates around the biggest hot-button issues of our times.  These  narrow nationalisms (including the Trump variety, but also perhaps the Modi variety), climate change, cyber-security and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation in manufacturing that is posing a serious threat to low-end jobs, refugee crises such as plight of the Rohingyas, and the ongoing battles creating fresh flux of conflict migrants, ecological damage owing to urbanisation, depletion of forest covers for agriculture and industry, river and ocean water pollution, etc. On the sociopolitical side, the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and the #MeToo movement and the new feminist wave gripping the world, the demand for new equality, the women’s marches in the United States but also in other countries, the rights of LGBTQ peoples and their battles with law and social prejudice, especially in a country like India, sex education and reproductive rights for women, etc, would figure prominently in the debates. Released a week before the WEF commences, the   underlines all the major threats and the likelihood of their occurrence or intensification, that the global systems need to face together. These include extreme weather events, natural disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud/theft, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, climate/war-induced involuntary migration, terror attacks, illicit trade, asset bubbles in major economies, weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear arms race, biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, spread of contagious diseases, water crises, food shortage, among others. In fact, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum has clearly stated in the risk report that “unilateral nationalisms” pose a threat to the joint action needed to mitigate these enormous challenges, making a thinly veiled reference to Trump. While Europe is banking on French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bring more collaborative projects together, the presence of post-Brexit United Kingdom prime minister Theresa May, is likely to add to the clamour. Last year, in the aftermath of Trump’s election to the White House, WEF found an unlikely foothold in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ode to globalisation, underlining the great irony of a communist country head batting for the global capital and free market of funds and ideas. While Xi hogged the limelight and China filled in the huge vacuum left by the US in matters of international leadership, this time,   by Xi’s economic adviser Liu He, amid concerns over One Belt One Road initiative’s possible . This leaves a big opportunity for PM Modi to pitch India’s as the global destination for investments. As part of his Make in India scheme, PM Modi is likely to use the hoopla surrounding his Davos visit to signal that India is greenlighting major global companies to invest in India. His business dinner with corporate heads on January 22 and his   on   at the opening plenary session are both being looked forward to by Indian and foreign observers alike.    Though Union finance minister   the WEF, PM will be accompanied by a retinue of ministers, including Piyush Goyal, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan, MJ Akbar and Jitendra Singh at Davos, and Modi’s motto is going to be  .  In two recent interviews, a rare occurrence in themselves, PM Modi maintained that his stint at Davos would be about “sharing his vision for India’s future engagement with the international community”. PM Modi is likely to meet Swiss premier Alain Berset to discuss issues of financial transparency and black money. Being the face of the world’s seventh largest economy with an excellent growth rate that was stymied somewhat by the twin shocks of 2016 and 2017, PM Modi’s handling of the 2.3 trillion dollar economy has been keenly watched in the almost four years into his government’s tenure. While the Indian delegation of business leaders and members of the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry), including Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Chanda Kochar, Uday Kotak, Ajay Singh, Rahul Bajaj, among others, will be signing or negotiating pacts with their foreign counterparts, superstar and king of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan will receive the annual Crystal Award (along with Cate Blanchett and Elton John) for his work towards “improving the state of the world”. While Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, has confirmed that PM   with 60 top global CEOs, including 20 from India, on January 22 night, would be a big deal, literally, other informal interactions at the sidelines with representatives of General Motors, Sakesforce, Royal Dutch Shell, Nestle, JP Morgan, Airbus, Hitachi, BAE Systems, IBM, etc would be top calls on the part of the prime minister. The mix of soft power in the yoga classes, as well as the hard power through strong negotiations at the financial high table, would nevertheless be met with puzzling questions on India’s economic performance at home, as well as the case of Aadhaar which has now garnered  , despite fawning editorials earlier. This would naturally put a question mark of Modi’s other flagship scheme, Digital India, and would also sit well with the prognosis on data fraud and risk posed by digitisation encapsulated in the Global Risk Report 2018 by the WEF organisers themselves.","date":"2018-01-22","tag":"Foreign relations,Diplomacy,Climate change,Narendra Modi","title":"World Economic Forum 2018: Anti-globalist Trump and FDI-hungry Modi stand for clashing trends in Davos","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/world-economic-forum-2018-davos-donald-trump-narendra-modi-climate-change-diplomacy-foreign-relations/story/1/21889.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15311},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a hit in front of crowds — with millions of people watching him, waiting for him to speak, looking up to his podium with the adoration one reserves for deities. Yet, for all his charisma, it is hard to get a one-on-one with the PM. It is a rare occasion when one gets to see Narendra Modi answer questions posed by an individual in a closed room. So it was an “Eid ka Chaand” moment when Zee News’ Sudhir Chaudhary got the PM to give him an  . Even when faced with softball questions, PM Modi managed to give a few biting replies that will help bolster his supporters' affection and raise many an eyebrow — especially among his critics and detractors. Responding to a question on democracy and criticism, the PM  : “Criticism should not be seen as bad and this is the strength of democracy where everything must be analysed. Good things should be praised and shortcomings should be criticised.” About the criticism of the BJP government’s economic and financial decisions — including GST, demonetisation and the GDP growth rate slowdown — Modi said it is healthy since the country’s focus has shifted towards economy and growth. He added, however, that the BJP government has faced “less criticism and more allegations” and that issues like corruption and black money have long been a topic of discussion. He also  , “Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST. We brought economic reform, built toilets, brought electricity to 18,000 villages. The success of GST lies in the power of the federal structure. It takes time to adjust to change, but the outcome will be good.” But it was not just criticism the PM spoke about. On being asked about his unique diplomatic style — as he has demonstrated with world leaders like former US president Barack Obama, current US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Modi said he is an ordinary person and that is what helps other leaders befriend him. “Every time I stand besides world leaders like Putin or Trump, all I remember is that I am the representative of 125 crore Indians. They have given me the mandate to be there. We must also remember world is an interconnected entity and we cannot live in isolation.” Continuing on his interactions with world leaders and India’s position in the world, Modi said: “India has been instrumental in bringing world’s attention to financial transparency. It was acknowledged by former United States president Barack Obama.” Modi further stated that the Word Economic Forum (WEF) in  , Switzerland — to be held on January 22 and 23 — will be a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with the strength of demographic dividend: “Davos is a major platform in the financial world. Many business leaders gather there to deliberate upon the economic future of the world. India is the centre of attraction for the entire world. There are two reasons for that. First, our GDP is growing at a fast pace — and this has been accepted by leading agencies like the World Bank, Moody's etc; second, due to our strong democratic values. It's a unique combination of both in India. And that's what has evoked everyone's interest. So it's an opportunity for India to showcase itself on a global platform like WEF in Davos.\" Speaking of the Opposition, the PM said that the UPA government “did not address the issues of states. The central government did not listen to us. We respect the federal structure. Hence, we were forced to take economic and monetary reforms”. GST is the product of such a reform, he added. “We have worked hard towards building the concept of one nation-one tax.” Modi also spoke of a number of development issues, especially pertaining to the financial. “The country has witnessed a growth of 70 lakh accounts of employee’s provident fund. The Mudra Scheme launched by the Centre has also been successful. The initiative of government e-market has empowered small-scale entrepreneurs across the country. It has not only helped in reducing government’s expenditure but also dismantled the monopoly of big entrepreneurs.” Several times during the interview, referring to the gigantic mandate that got him elected, Modi said, “My work is to be the voice of 125 crore citizens and I am trying to do that honestly.”","date":"2018-01-19","tag":"Sudhir Chaudhary,Zee News,Interview,Narendra Modi","title":"'Don't judge me on demonetisation and GST': Modi talks tough on criticism in interview","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-interview-zee-news-gst-demonetisation-netanyahu-gdp-growth/story/1/21856.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15312},{"author":"Pooja Shali","content":"The news of the impending disqualification of   for allegedly holding office of profit spread like wildfire in newsrooms today (January 19) afternoon. According to AAP leaders, the matter to be referred to the president of India is without a complete hearing of the \"office of profit\" case. With that, the expected political blame game ensued throughout the day. Soon after coming to power in 2015, the AAP government had passed an amendment to the Delhi Members of Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1997 to \"exempt the post of parliamentary secretary from the definition of office of profit with retrospective effect\". The Kejriwal government later appointed 21 AAP legislators as parliamentary secretaries in order \"to assist ministers in speedy implementation of work\". The party even claimed that the 21 MLAs won't take any remuneration and so wouldn't fall under the office of profit regulations. It was the Congress, which on June 9, 2016 had moved the poll panel seeking disqualification of the 21 MLAs. Considering that one of them, Jarnail Singh, had resigned to contest the Punjab Assembly polls, the number stands at 20 now. The disqualification of the MLAs will pave way for by-elections in the Delhi Assembly. Sources claim 11 MLAs have been heard by the Election Commission and their statements recorded so far. The AAP, however, says these were not part of official hearing as the case was still in early stages of designating if EC, as a constitutional body, should hear the matter. Around 2pm today, reporters claimed their sources in the Election Commission (EC) hinted at a possible recommendation being sent to the president's office. It was also reported that the recommendation letter would agree that the MLAs received undue privileges as parliamentary secretaries, an additional position given to elected representatives (the appointments were against protocol). \r\n \r\n There, however, was no official announcement by the EC in this regard, neither a confirmation nor a denial. And this is what has precisely got the AAP's goat. The party leaders attacked the Election Commission for acting \"as an agent of the BJP\" and \"leaking information to the media\". \r\n \r\n The development signals considerable trouble for the AAP, which also heads the government in Delhi. AAP MLA Madan Lal rushed to the Delhi High Court in the hope of managing to get a stay order on the case. The court, instead, refused any interim relief and will hear the matter again on Monday at 4pm. The HC also reiterated to the party that the court has already deemed the positions unconstitutional last year and would not interfere further, asking the party to approach and respond to EC summons. \r\n \r\n \"If approved by the president, 20 of the 66 MLAs will be disqualified, with immediate effect. With 46 in tow (BJP-3,  SAD-1), they would still retain majority in the 70-member Assembly.   Interestingly, two MLAs within the AAP are anyway considered \"opposition\" - the vocal critic Kapil Mishra and Pankaj Pushkar, a supporter of Yogendra Yadav. So, the number would unofficially stand at 44 , for the AAP.  Delhi will have to then brace for by-polls to 20 empty seats. The situation, however, is purely hypothetical right now considering neither the EC nor the president's office has confirmed the \"movement of the file\". Sources maintain that the notice has been received and is under consideration. As reporters rushed to the AAP office by 3pm, party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj launched a scathing attack against the EC, making a personal remark about CEC AK Joti's age and his approaching retirement. “AK Joti was the principal secretary under [the then Gujarat chief minister] Narendra Modi and then the chief secretary of Gujarat. He is retiring on Monday. So you want to repay Modiji’s debt. You are mortgaging a constitutional post like the Election Commission,” Bhardwaj said. But the matter is at sub-judice, a fact that the AAP spokespersons were quick to remind. Party leaders, meanwhile, started to reach Arvind Kejriwal's Civil Lines residence and went into a huddle. Each AAP insider, I spoke to, expressed deep anger against the Union government, before the line either got cut or went on hold. The party leaders were oscillating between \"breaking news\" correspondents and chalking out a survival strategy. Since its inception, the AAP has accused most existing institutions of being corrupt and anti-people - media houses, political parties and bureaucracy had been declared as bought-off by the rich and the powerful. The party eventually realised that, once in power, the perpetual derogatory tone is not the best way forward. Interestingly, the Election Commission's credibility had also been questioned occasionally by the party, but today the AAP came out all guns blazing. But it's debatable if their arguments were justified since rather than focussing on facts, party members primarily targetted the chief Election Commisioner over his alleged proximity to the BJP. But it seems the AAP is not alone. Many others are also raising questions over the EC's move. \r\n \r\n Did the EC give any reasonable evidence in its defence against AAP's allegations that an independent organisation has compromised its credibility at the behest of a ruling party at the Centre? Well, an explanation by the EC will clear the air, before Arvind Kejriwal seizes the opportunity.","date":"2018-01-19","tag":"Election Commission,Delhi,AAP,Office of Profit","title":"AAP MLAs disqualification: How the 'office of profit' case unfolded","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-20-mlas-office-of-profit-election-commission-ak-joti-bjp-bypolls/story/1/21854.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15313},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"A fortnight after the riot at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on January 16 exhorted BJP workers to get into election mode in the next six months. That has led to speculation that the BJP might prepone Assembly election in Maharashtra by a year along with polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram. In his fourth year as the CM, Fadnavis' hopes to retain power are pinned on two \"achievements\" — his government’s social welfare schemes and the scattered opposition. While the first one has failed to convince the BJP cadre, the second situation might not last long, in the rapidly changing political scenario. Fadnavis has been insisting that BJP workers go out in public beating the drums on his government’s two goals, water conservation and debt-free farmers. The state’s flagship scheme, Jal Yukta Shivar, aimed at making 5,000 villages free of water scarcity every year, has delivered impressive results in some areas. The government has managed to deposit Rs 28,000 crore in the farmers’ bank accounts in an attempt to make them debt-free. However, neither the party workers nor its elected representatives are enthusiastic in advertising the government’s work. On the political front, the main opposition parties, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), are slowly but steadily working on their respective revival plans. The Congress has suddenly started feeling energetic after the Bombay High Court refused to prosecute its state president Ashok Chavan in the Adarsh society scam on technical grounds. Now, as he has no fear of action, Chavan is expected to come up with a broad strategy to corner the government. Confident that the government will not take any action against its two top leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the multi-crore irrigation scam, the NCP too has launched aggressive posturing against the government’s policies. A source told   that a fact-finding committee has not found any evidence of Tatkare’s involvement in the irrigation scam. On the contrary, the committee has pointed fingers at Pawar, whom the government does not want to touch due to several political compulsions. Caught in a tricky situation Fadnavis has only one option — boosting the morale of the BJP workers. He needs to pay attention to their grievances and demands and pat their back to make them feel they are also part of the government. His statement on poll preparedness is sparked by the sense of uneasiness he has noticed across the state. (Courtesy of  )","date":"2018-01-19","tag":"BJP.

Now, imagine what happens when the snow on these high mountains melts at a faster rate in view of the rising global temperature? From Jammu and Kashmir in the west, to Arunachal Pradesh in the east, India is blessed with an almost 2,500km-long Himalayan range with varying biodiversity in sync with altitudes. This includes Ladakh and parts of Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) that fall in the trans-Himalayan region. This is all part of the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region spanning eight countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (under Chinese occupation), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar — dependent on and facing similar problems due to the rising temperature in the HKH region. Ladakh has been witnessing increasing temperatures. Precipitation (snowfall in case of Ladakh) has been erratic to say the least. On the other hand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have been witnessing similar developments with springs going dry early each passing year. Mountain communities are dependent on the local springs for their daily water needs rather than the massive rivers gushing through deep gorges or meandering through valleys. What people on the ground and experts have been saying has been corroborated in a report that will soon be released. The changing climate is indeed a serious issue when it comes to the Himalayas, the repository of snow/glaciers that feed billions in the subcontinent. As part of the Paris Agreement, more than 190 countries have committed to reducing their green house emissions and taking various measures to ensure that the global temperature does not go beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (as compared to the pre-industrial time). But, even when the world manages to maintain the global temperature rise average at 1.5 degrees Celsius, there will be a rise of 2 degrees Celsius or more in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region by the end of the century, resulting in a substantial decrease in snowfall and melt rates increasing by at least 33 per cent. This is already happening as temperature increases more rapidly in the high-altitude region, points out a report being coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ), an inter-governmental organisation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (China), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The soon-to-be published report \"Comprehensive Assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) Region\", as part of the \"Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( )\" that is coordinated by the ICIMOD, points to a decrease in snow-covered areas and snow volumes over the coming decades in response to the increased temperatures and to the rise in the snowline elevation. The rising temperatures in the Ladakh region, made up of Leh and Kargil districts, should be a cause of immediate concern. Leh’s annual precipitation is about 100mm, all snow. Kargil receives more precipitation than Leh. For centuries, the region has received snow starting from October till March, vital for the survival of Ladakhi people and agriculture. Of this, snowfall in December, January and February is most important. But the scores of people whom I met last year and still others who I spoke with this year have been complaining about how snow has been missing for almost the whole of December in Leh town (about 11,000feet) and villages at a relatively lower altitude. A quick glimpse at the   (CRIS) of the Hydromet division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Leh shows that between 2012 and 2016, snowfall in November for four out of five years showed 100 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. For December, three out of five years show above 90 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. I called Sonam Lotus, who heads the IMD’s Jammu and Kashmir office, to understand what this data means. “Although just five years’ data is not sufficient to predict a trend, it is nevertheless true that snowfall in Ladakh has been variable and inconsistent. But one thing our records show is that there has been a significant increase in temperature (in Ladakh) especially after the 1980s,” he told me. Earlier, when there was snowfall, the snow would remain for almost a week or more. But now it melts in just two days, he observed, arguing that the increasing number of people (including the large number of tourists) and vehicles have pumped enthno-carbon and other green house gases into the atmosphere as Ladakh witnesses a drastic change, positive by conventional standards, in the standard of living. While talking about the future of the mountain communities and how their lives and livelihoods are integral to the well-being of the mountains, a common factor that comes forth across regions is the participation of the communities themselves. Unfortunately, government programmes largely neglect local communities. Be it the dams in the fragile Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, be it factories set up along the rivers in the Himalayan foothills or the mounting problem of municipal solid waste, the government wants to keep away the community and bring in an outsourced partner. For decades now, the effects of such a debilitating approach are for all to see. It simply has not worked because community participation is the key to conservation, the key to ensure that local and global interests are taken care of. One of the best examples is the World Wide Fund: India’s Western Arunachal Landscape programme, which began in 2010, has been monitoring the presence of and working for the conservation of threatened species along with the local Monpa population of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The community was faced with the crisis of springs drying faster — a continuous topic of discussion among the community and the WWF people. “Our conservation programme are primarily community conserved programmes, managed and owned by the local community. It is for their interest, to secure their livelihood and their ecological needs. For many years now, the community has been talking about the need for spring rejuvenation. We now plan to study and identify the springs in these two districts as a pilot project,” said Kamal Medhi, WWF-India coordinator, Western Arunachal Landscape. It is the tenacity of the communities that will help in the long run, with or without government help. But having committed to the United Nations via the Paris Agreement, governments of the HKH region countries are duty-bound to help their mountain communities. Going beyond the geo-political boundaries, these communities have had a healthy cultural exchange and a thriving trade. Even today, positive case studies from one mountain community can be tried by others and the government can facilitate such experiments. After all, for the government of India, as for other countries, there are very limited options when it comes to water availability. Surely, the Himalayas and their glaciers, the snow and the rivers that sustain such an enormous population are vital for our survival.","date":"2018-01-18","tag":"Himalayas,Climate change,Global warming","title":"Rise in temperatures is threatening the survival of Himalayas","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/global-warming-climate-change-himalayas-ladakh-arunachal-extreme-weather/story/1/21812.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15315},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"To immense applause from almost every quarter have the Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs)   between the newfound friends India and Israel, with great energy and enthusiasm from the respective prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu. The chemistry and bonhomie have already become legendary, and among the most talked about MoUs has been the “ ” deal, involving cooperation and sharing of data in the fields of cyber security, energy and agriculture. Involving a   cutting across sectors, such as cyberspace, energy, agricultural technology, Internet of Things and Internet of Energy, the big data deal has been pegged as “boosting measures... to revolutionise Indian farm production”. According to the Union ministry of external affairs website, the   signed between India’s Vijay Gokhale, MEA’s secretary of economic relations, and Israel’s Yuval Rotem, “envisages cooperation in the field of cyber security to develop, promote and expand cooperation in the field of HRD through various platforms and arrangements such as training programmes, skill development, and simulator based hands-on training. It also envisages collaborating in the field of cyber security resilience, promoting B2B cooperation in cyber security and facilitating industrial summits”. While the MoU between the respective ministries of petroleum and natural gas/energy cooperation states that it’s about “looking to explore opportunities of long-term cooperative relationship and joint economic projects to enhance bilateral engagements in the field of Oil and Gas, inter-alia including collaboration in upstream sector activities; R&D and Technology; promoting institutional linkages between Universities and R&D establishment for mutually beneficial collaboration; and in the area of Start-ups”. Another related MoU has been signed between Invest India and Invest in Isarel – respective platforms – with the purpose of “supporting and developing cooperation between the two sides through exchange of information on investment opportunities, relevant laws and regulations, policies and government initiatives”. Keeping these three MoUs in mind, it’s important to look at another related news which claims that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is set to  , a “big data and smart city tech provider”, which is an important business delegate of visiting PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s official retinue. Reported by a number of websites, the then imminent deal was about RIL’s “move to get deep into the smart city, big data, defence and critical infrastructure space”. As reported by  , this deal is about RIL getting “access to next-level technology on a number of mission-critical monitoring systems, big data analytics software for power utilities, industrial internet of things (IoT), smart cities, critical infrastructure and defence sector”.   quotes an official part of the B2B event, saying: “mPrest places a specific focus on the IoE (Internet of Energy) sector. Its power utility offering is a ‘System of Systems’ platform with applications including DERMS (distributed energy resource management), asset health management, mobile asset management, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) enhancement and critical infrastructure protection security, and cyber management”. It’s important to read these two news items together to arrive at, if not a set of conclusions, certainly a set of pressing questions. Given the critical big data deal between Israel and India comes at a time when extremely sensitive matters of the very constitutionality of such mass-scale data scooping, collation and storage without the citizens’ informed consent, and/or any informed opinion on the technologically nebulous issues, are being heard in the top court of India, how are we to read this inter-governmental agreement, if not as an instance of technology-driven impatience of both governments and corporate behemoths? \r\n \r\n As reported in  , apparently, the data-driven methods are being shared and accessed to “fight cybercrimes”, and the request for access to big data was from the Israeli side in the context of “how technology can now be used to agglomerate vast amounts of information and then bear on individual field and individual farmer’s efforts, improve the yield”. It’s interesting that in a country in which the majority of “individual farmers” are either landless or with very small landing holdings, with virtually no access to digital tech or data thereof, even as they are being forced to obtain the biometrics-based Aadhaar card and then link it to other nodes of information/identity proofs, the peg on which the “big data deal” has been hung is agricultural technology via data analytics. In fact, Union minister of agriculture Radhamohan Singh “participated” in the delegation-level talks on agriculture collaboration using India’s population big database. Moreover, to questions of “safeguards in place to share Aadhaar-based data with Israel”, there were no clear answers, other than stating basis aspects of an agriculture-centric programme. While the digital push to augment agriculture might be commendable in theory, there have been reported instances of   a very tangible, essential, non-digital ingredient necessary for agriculture – the waters of Narmada River. Even as the Sardar Sarovar Dam has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with great fanfare, the   to “canals” and not farmlands, is becoming a huge bone of contention among the farmers of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Even Hardik Patel, the young Patidar leader who campaigned against BJP in Gujarat has tweeted his reaction to the agriculture-centric MoU between India and Israel based on the grievance on the ground. \r\n \r\n Given that the priorities of the government aren't exactly in perfect order when it comes to agriculture, with massive debt, rainfall lapses, crop failures and other endemic issues haunting tens of thousands of farmers, exactly how will a deal involving sharing of big data between governments and corporate behemoths - integrating the diverse investments in energy and telecom, while spreading its wings in emerging fields of data analytics and critical-monitoring systems - actually help the farmer in whose name the MoU has been signed? Which brings us to the next question: what about data security and privacy? What is the exact nature of the data that will be shared, and what all safeguards are being put into place? How is it that another country, Israel, is given access to India’s centralised databases, whose existence is under the scanner, and whose legality is being debated in the Supreme Court of India, as we speak? There have been a number of reports   by foreign agencies – whether foreign government-driven or private and commercial, but big enough to  , and the Aadhaar database –  as has been repeatedly proven –  is a  . In this context, it is important to ask if the inter-governmental MoU between India and Israel is at odds with the fundamental   of the individual farmer at whose behest the big data is being collected, shared with another country? All this at a time when a giant corporate entity from India, with extensive interests in oil and natural gas, telecom, etc is looking to not just   diverse fields, but also control the mechanisms of monitoring via   of Indians. As internet and privacy rights activists have asked, what does it mean to have “ ”? One of the fundamental premises is we must safeguard people, citizens, individuals, over innovations in technology that erode privacy, individuality, autonomy – informational and bodily. Aadhaar-based authentication and databases have proven to be structurally invasive and exclusionary, which means any technology based on, or dependent on, such a loophole-ridden system is problematic to the very core, at odds with India’s billion-plus citizens, who should not be treated as mere sources of data and be . In fact, Biju Janata Dal MP Tathagata Satpathy has argued on exactly this line, saying a line of argument that treats   should compensate citizens for sharing their data, not otherwise. Instead, if citizens are being harnessed and farmed for data, as it were, by governments, technology giants and corporate behemoths alike, then we have created a system that’s extremely problematic, to say the least.","date":"2018-01-18","tag":"Modi government,Benjamin Netanyahu,India-Israel","title":"India-Israel ‘big data’ deal leaves questions about security and privacy unanswered","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aadhaar-benjamin-netanyahu-modi-india-israel-big-data-deal-privacy-surveillance/story/1/21823.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15316},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"I am not a very religious person, though I was born a Hindu. I do celebrate the festivals and follow most of the rituals. My father was a follower of the Arya Samaj and we had \"havans\" on all auspicious occasions, a tradition I continue to this day. I was born in Pakistan and growing up in newly independent India, differences of religion, caste or ethnicity were not something I was aware of. We were taught to respect everyone, regardless of their roots. Some may call me deracinated, and I have to confess I still do not know my \"gotra\", but I believe the greatest quality of Hinduism is its liberalism and its plurality. It is those qualities that are under threat today, as who we pray to and how we pray becomes politicised. Where there is religion, can politics be far behind? This unholy alliance is ruining the world. Our democracy has been weakened by vote bank politics. The most obvious manifestation of this is the culture of appeasement of minorities practised by the Congress party in the 49 years it ruled the country since Independence. The aggressive assertion of Hinduism, otherwise termed as Hindutva, that we are witnessing today is a backlash to this. As the BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe writing in this issue says, “it has spurred a mindless competition to get the tag of minorities”. This is not the way forward if we are to build an equitable society. The disadvantaged should be helped regardless of caste, creed or religion. It will happen only if we stop mixing politics with religion and prevent extremists from radicalising faith. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s new book,  , puts upfront a critical issue of our time - the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva. While Hinduism has a distinct cultural ethos with a common history, common literature and common civilisation, Hindutva believes Indian nationalism is the same as Hindu nationalism, and that non-Hindus must acknowledge their Hindu parentage or convert to Hinduism to return to their true cultural roots. Hindutva maintains that Hindus need to preserve and protect their religion and culture against the onslaught of a hostile, alien world. It is insecurity that drives this sentiment rather than strength, which is what Swami Vivekananda, who can only be described as the first rock star of Hinduism, believed in. I believe Hinduism teaches us to live amidst a variety of other identities, and to do anything differently would be, as Tharoor notes, a partition of the soul, after the partition of the soil. In the best traditions of the religion, we have invited reputed scholars, ideologues and politicians to debate the issue. There is former BJP general secretary, KN Govindacharya, who believes Hindutva means Hinduness and not Hindu nationalism in the Western sense; former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi says the freedom of a Hindu to self-define his or her dharma is the greatest asset of Hinduism; novelist Kiran Nagarkar calls out the Sangh Parivar for obliterating the inherent inclusive values of Hinduism; while the bestselling author Devdutt Pattanaik exposes the myth of the wounded Hindu, tormented by a thousand years of slavery at the hands of the invaders. There is much more. Some of it is despondent, such as author and translator Arshia Sattar’s argument that the distinction between Hinduism as plural and Hindutva as singular is being lost at the hands of the newly empowered local gatekeepers of Hinduism and active proponents of a \"Hindu Rashtra\". For a multi-cultural country like India to be divided on the basis of religion is a recipe for disaster. But I remain hopeful. After all, which other religion in the world can say that it does not claim to be the only true one?

Pakistan Taliban’s claims are published in a  ,  , written by a senior Taliban leader Abu Mansoor Asim Mufti Noor Wali. The book was published on November 30, 2017, at Maseed Computer Centre at Barmal, in Afghanistan’s Paktika province. The 588-page book, posted online, contains TTP’s history, military operations, activities in Afghanistan, pictures of many Taliban leaders, and claims its involvement in a suicide bombing two months earlier at Bhutto’s procession in Karachi in October 2007, killing more than 140 people. The book claims that, “Despite attacks on Benazir Bhutto’s procession in Karachi, the government had not taken appropriate security measures that made it possible for the attackers to have easy access to Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi.” According to the book, Bhutto was killed since “her return was planned on the behest of the Americans as they had given her a plan against the ‘Mujahideen-e-Islam'. And slain Pakistan Taliban founder Baitullah Mehsud had received information of the plan”. For the first time, a terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the assassination which altered the political dynamics of Pakistan. Musharraf was accused of conspiring Bhutto’s assassination, murder trial remained controversial and Musharraf was declared fugitive. It is important to understand what compelled the TTP to make this announcement after 10 years. It would be useful to analyse some of the developments to be able to understand the unconventional move by the banned terrorist group. Pakistan's military launched a major offensive,  , in 2014 in North Waziristan and Khyber, following a major attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on June 8, 2014. The Operation was seen as a major success within Pakistan and the official records projected remarkable decrease in suicide attacks, terrorist attacks and fatalities in terrorist attacks. However, while the operation targeted a large number of TTP operatives, it did not manage to control the growth of extremism and terror within the country. There were major terror attacks in northwestern region conducted by Jaamat-ul-Ahrar (JA), a splinter group of TTP. The beginning of 2017 witnessed a series of terror attacks claimed by ISIS, challenging the success of the military’s counter-terror efforts. On February 22, 2017, Pakistan Army announced the launch of a nationwide military operation, Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. According to an ISPR release, “the efforts entail conduct of broad spectrum security/counter terrorism operations by Rangers in Punjab, continuation of ongoing operations across the country and focus on more effectives border security management. Country wide de-weaponisation and explosive control are additional cardinals of the effort\".  The operation came as a response to a series of at least six back-to-back attacks in Pakistan within a week (mid-February 2017), killing more than 100 people in different parts of Pakistan. One of the deadliest attacks in the string of terror attacks took place on February 16, when a suicide bomber blew himself up among the devotees in the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. The attack was claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) and resulted in about 88 deaths and 300 injured. On the same day, in Awaran, an IED attack on a military convoy took place. is a continuation of the \"National Action Plan\" which was formulated after the 2014 attack in Peshawar on Army Public School. Expectations with Radd-ul-Fasaad have been high and army has claimed positive results from the ongoing operation, but the fact remains, that military’s \"selective approach\" in targeting terrorists will never allow the counter-terror efforts to succeed. Pakistan's military has been extremely proud of its counter-terror operations as these efforts have assisted the military to regain its waning credibility and prestige after  . Pakistan did draw out some applause from the US administration for its efforts in April 2017. The US-Pakistan relationship has been strained over the past six years and took an unyielding shift with the announcement of President Donald Trump’s Afghan policy which carried a firm message for Pakistan. Trump excoriated Pakistan for harboring criminals and terrorists. The US   revealed in December 2017 also carries an equally harsh message for Islamabad. Pakistan denied the charges and has reacted strongly to the US stance, claiming that Islamabad has lost 50,000 civilians and 6,000 security personnel in the war on terror and Washington cannot ignore these sacrifices. Although the US-Pakistan relationship is at the lowest in the past 16 years, the fact remains that both nations need each others’ support for various compelling reasons. While the US will require Pakistan’s support till it wants to continue its presence in Afghanistan, Pakistan is reliant on the US given its influence in international organisations. Washington is pressurising Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and Pakistan cannot afford not to take US concerns and stance into consideration. There have also been reports of ISIS establishing its base in Pakistan and spreading its tentacles. The  published by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, alleges that ISIS is especially active in northern Sindh and Balochistan. Given these developments - Pakistan's military rejoicing over its victory over terrorists (mainly TTP as it is the deadliest anti-state organisation), US pressure on Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and the threat posed by the expansion of ISIS - one can infer what led to Pakistani Taliban’s revelation of Bhutto’s assassination. The revelation at this point of time serves three main purposes for the TTP: • It is a repeat signal to Pakistan's military that TTP would counter every move of US-Pakistan partnership in counter-terror operations. • In the past one year, terror attacks by ISIS have been on the rise which poses a threat to TTP’s status. The announcement also helps the organisation to reassert its presence. • Lastly and very importantly, it brings Pakistani Taliban in news and national and international limelight in an effort to maintain its positon and status in the competitive world of terrorism. While Pakistan's military claims that terror attacks are reducing in numbers, the TTP appears to be intact and determined in its resolve to oppose the state.","date":"2018-01-16","tag":"TTP,Musharraf,Pakistan,Benazir Bhutto","title":"Why Pakistan Taliban is claiming it killed Benazir Bhutto","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/benazir-bhutto-assassination-pakistan-musharraf-tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-baitullah-mehsud/story/1/21782.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15318},{"author":"Ashok K Singh","content":"VHP leader  ’s allegations about \"conspiracy to kill him to weaken the Hindutva forces\" sound as startling as the Congress’s overtures to him appear to be confounding. But pause for a moment to think and you will see that it’s neither startling nor confounding. The Togadia episode fits in well with the current politics of the BJP as well as the Congress. The international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been out in the cold for the past many years. He is of no use to BJP stalwarts Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in their home state. Togadia had no role to play in the Gujarat Assembly elections or its politics for a long time now. Modi has been winning the state elections on his own steam since 2001. In the early years, Togadia’s rabble-rousing, Muslim-baiting rhetoric helped mobilise VHP workers in Modi’s favour, but gradually Modi cut him to size.  Notwithstanding his nuisance value and hate speeches, Togadia, perhaps, was an asset for the BJP before and during the Vajpayee era. So were Ashok Singhal, assortment of sants and sadhus and many of Sangh Parivar motor mouths. But the Ayodhya issue gradually lost momentum after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Although it prepared the ground for the first BJP-led government at the Centre, the party realised it was running out of agendas to keep the Hindutva pot boiling. Until Modi strode across the Gujarat landscape as he became chief minister in 2001. Soon 2002 riots happened and Modi burst onto the national scene. After the riots, Modi had no need for Togadia and his ilk in Gujarat. He emerged at the head of the hardline Hindutva, as its most potent mascot. He was capable of packaging VHP, Bajrang Dal, LK Advani and Vajpayee in one heady mix that became brand Modi. He could do everything that Togadia was capable of, and much more, but in a subtler manner. By Modi's second term as chief minister, Togadia and VHP became virtually irrelevant in Gujarat. The VHP and Bajrang Dal lost traction. In 2007 Assembly elections, Modi forced Togadia to stay out of Gujarat. In 2012 elections, a desperate Togadia tried to stage a comeback. He threw his lot with rebel BJP leader and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, but results reaffirmed Modi’s invincibility. The people of Gujarat had bought into Modi's cocktail of development and Hindutva.  Despite Modi facing rough weather in the recent Assembly elections, Togadia remained a persona non grata for the BJP.  His mysterious disappearance for a day, hospitalisation and press conference alleging that he feared for his life in \"fake police encounter\" at the behest of the forces that wanted to weaken the Hindutva cause can be understood in the background of his strained relations with Modi. But the Congress seems to be placing values on even a weakened and irrelevant Togadia. In its desperate bid to reclaim lost power, the Congress under the president Rahul Gandhi is prepared to adopt all means, including supping with disgruntled Hindutva forces. Senior Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia met Togadia at the hospital in public glare. He said he met the VHP leader in his “personal capacity”, but expressed concern about \"dangers\" to Togadia’s life. Rahul Gandhi’s ally in Gujarat elections, Hardik Patel, too met him. \r\n \r\n While they hit out at Modi and the Gujarat dispensation and demanded inquiry into Togadia’s allegations, it was ironical that they didn’t speak about the former doctor who has been a symbol of hate and bigoted politics. The BJP has asked the Congress to clarify its stand on whether the party supports the VHP leader. Hardik Patel posted a flurry of tweets before and after meeting Togadia. \r\n \r\n The Congress’s hobnobbing with the VHP leader is part of Rahul Gandhi’s grand strategy to take the fight to the BJP camp. Emboldened by restricting the BJP to under-100 seats in Gujarat after his temple-hopping, declaring himself a Shiv-bhakht and janeudhari, Rahul Gandhi has made his intentions clear: a brick for a brick and an eye for an eye in the run up to the 2019 elections. Karnataka is bracing for a contest for Hindu votes between the Congress and the BJP. Later in the year, the contest is set to become even more ugly as the politics of grabbing majority votes gathers moment. One can understand Rahul Gandhi’s compulsion in wooing Hindus to regain votes the Congress has lost to the BJP. What’s difficult to stomach is that the Congress is willing to court someone like Togadia, perhaps the biggest hate monger the country has seen in the post-independence period. The central leadership of the Congress has not commented on Modhwadia’s meeting with Togadia, which speaks of its dilemma on taking a clear- cut stand. The Congress should have explained why Modhwadia met him and why didn’t he condemn Togadia’s politics while demanding investigations into the VHP leader’s allegations. The Congress’s occasional dalliance with the RSS has been known. Indira Gandhi’s temple visits and Rajiv Gandhi’s courting of soft-Hindutva for votes and its terrible consequences are also known. But never has the Congress dared to have truck with any bigot or Muslim baiter like Togadia or has even given the impression that it's ready to do politics with such elements. Or has the difference between “soft” and \"hardline\" Hindutva been completely blurred?  ","date":"2018-01-17","tag":"Narendra Modi,VHP,Pravin togadia,Congress","title":"Newfound love for Pravin Togadia unmasks Congress' Hindutva agenda","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pravin-togadia-congress-rahul-gandhi-hardik-patel-vhp-modi-amit-shah/story/1/21788.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15319},{"author":"Claude Arpi","content":"On New Year's Eve, President Xi Jinping   to extend his greetings to all Chinese and… friends all over the world. Xi said that Beijing is dedicated to safeguarding peace. \"China will act as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and an upholder of the international order.\" Will this translate in peace on the border in 2018? Probably not! Rumours are circulating that troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have intruded in Gelling sector in the Siang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh. China has not fully digested the fact that India stood up for Bhutan when the PLA was trying to build a road in June near the trijunction between Sikkim and Chumbi Valley in Tibet. Quoting \"experts\", a PLA website admitted that China will be better prepared \"next time\": \"the recent Doklam standoff had propelled China to perfect its strategy in its western part\" said chinamil.com.cn. Zhao Xiaozhuo, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences is quoted by the same newspaper: \"India never takes road construction as an opportunity… and only thinks about its own interest.\" Was the road on Bhutanese territory really an opportunity for India? It makes no sense. During a recent press conference, the spokesperson of the China's ministry of national defence said India \"should strictly control its troops\". While China is getting ready for another standoff, Beijing deeply dislikes Delhi developing its side of the border.  resented the recent visit of the Indian Union home minister  ; Singh spent the New Year with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). \"An Indian road construction project connecting all border posts along the China-India frontier could lead to new military standoffs between China and India,\" warned another Chinese expert. China is unhappy because Rajnath Singh asserted that \"a number of border posts had already been connected with roads and many would soon be linked… this would enhance the operational efficiency of the officers and reduce mountain-related sickness among them.\" While Beijing is going full steam to build infrastructure on its side of the McMahon Line, it complains about Delhi building roads on India's borders; amazing double standards. Nelong Border Outpost (BoP), located at the height of 11,700 feet, is manned by the ITBP. Accompanied by ITBP director general, RK Pachnanda, the minister later visited Pulam Sumda (14,200 feet) and interacted with jawans and officers. The area is disputed by the Chinese only because Beijing refuses to adhere to the universally-accepted principle of \"watershed\" used for demarcating borders. In Nelang, the watershed in the area is located at Tsangchok pass, beyond Pulam Sumda. At the same time, Beijing does whatever it wants on its side of the border.  recently reported: \"Investment in infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is helping to lift 628 villages along the border out of poverty.\" The Chinese newspaper further asserted: \"After getting access to electricity and the construction of new roads, tea farmers and herdsmen in a village some 200 kilometres southwest of Lhasa in Tsona county founded a cooperative that provides skills training and job opportunities for villagers.\" Lepo, a tiny village, north of Khenzimane, the last border post on the McMahon Line is said to have received several thousands of visitors last year and adequate lodging facilities have been provided to them. China further admitted: \"Starting last year, more than 100 million yuan (Rs 99.4 crore) has been invested in infrastructure in villages of less than 100 families as a part of a broader construction project to build model villages in the border area.\"  estimated that by 2020, the road access rate in the area will reach 100 per cent and the per capita disposable income will double. Last week, Xinhua reported that China's least populated township had been connected to the national grid. It is Yume (also spelt Yulmed), the first hamlet north of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh.Remember, at that time of the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping had written a letter to two young Tibetan herders who had introduced their village to the Chinese president.

He is the third chief minister in four and a half years. Bizenjo replaced Sanaullah Zehri of the PML (Nawaz), who was forced to resign from office ahead of a no-confidence motion against him. Not surprisingly, 11 of the 14 incoming cabinet members are members of the PML(N). Most observers see this manoeuvre as the Pakistan Army’s move to punish former PM Nawaz Sharif by depriving his party of any sustenance. If anything, this is a sign that parties and ideology don’t matter in official Baloch politics, but it is individuals who are easily open to manipulation. In fact, Bizenjo won the 2013 election with just 544 votes cast in his favour. The turnout in his constituency was just 1.18 per cent. In 2013, PML(N) won a majority of seats and formed a coalition government and selected a middle-class Baloch nationalist, Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party as chief minister. But Malik had to make way for Zehri in 2015. Baloch nationalists opposed the elections and many boycotted the process. Even those who did participate, such as Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the leader of the Balochistan National Party, rejected the outcome, charging authorities with manipulating the results. Balochistan has suffered from prolonged political turmoil and successive phases of insurgency and violent religious extremism. The most recent bout of violence began in 2003 and is still continuing. In the period between 2011 and 2016, nearly 4,000 people were killed, including 1,000 classed as terrorists, who could be separatists or sectarian killers who target Shias in the Quetta area. In 2017, violence intensified with massive bombings in Quetta, and other areas targeting Shias, Sufis and security forces. At the end of the year, a bomb blast killed nine and injured 57 people when a Methodist Church was targeted by the Islamic State. The Pakistan Army has sought to use violent religious extremist groups to counter Baloch nationalism and blame India for the violence. There are of course nationalist groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army, Baloch Republican Army and Baloch Liberation Front. Pakistani authorities focus their ire on Brahamdagh Bugti of the BRA as the principal villain because he is openly pro-Indian and has even sought political asylum in India. But actually, most Baloch nationalists reject secession in favour of greater autonomy and the groups are hopelessly divided along tribal lines. Balochistan has now come into international focus because of a report that the Chinese may be establishing a naval base on the Jiwani peninsula, adjoining the port they built and operate in Gwadar. Not many are taken in by Beijing’s denial. As for Gwadar, it is the starting point of CPEC, which has become a flagship scheme of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan claims Chinese investments will generate jobs and prosperity for everyone, including the Baloch. The government believes that once the mega projects kick in, Baloch nationalism will lose steam. There is an element of wishful thinking in the Pakistani belief that CPEC will be an answer to all its problems and moderate Baloch nationalism. They believe the Baloch live in a feudal environment, dominated by their sardars and once the area is opened up, things will change. Pakistani authorities have shown little sophistication in addressing the challenge of violence in the province whose roots go back to the sensitive issue of Baloch identity. The Pakistani state, especially the Army, tends to see Baloch nationalism as a threat to Pakistan’s integrity. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to introduce the “Indian hand” as the cause of problems. They cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s references in his Independence Day speech in 2016 and their capture of naval officer Kubhushan Jadhav to back their claims. However, Modi’s reference was innocuous to say the least and as for Jadhav, there is no real proof that he was involved in doing anything in Balochistan. Politics are not normal in Pakistan, and even less so Balochistan. Violence and political turbulence are, of course, there, but the real problem is that it is somehow not seen as being part of the Pakistani mainstream. By and large, its parties are electoral coalitions that rise and come apart depending on the exigencies of power. Sentiments are with Baloch nationalists, but authority is exercised by an elite which is backed by the Army.

It is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with experts calling it the most sophisticated ID programme in the world. Yet, recent events have proven that this mammoth exercise, which the present government has further pressed hard to make a standard requirement for availing the most commonplace of benefits and services, also faces the equally mammoth threat — data leakage. On January 3,   said its correspondent was given access to personal data, including names, addresses, postal codes, photos, phone numbers and emails of Aadhaar card holders for as little as  What’s more, with an additional Rs 300, illegal operators provided her a \"software\" that could facilitate printing of the Aadhaar card after entering the Aadhaar number of any individual. The initial response of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), which implements Aadhaar, was one of the proverbial \"shooting the messenger\", but following the cacophony the issue raised, it stepped into some positive action. UIDAI restricted access of around 5,000 designated officials to the Aadhaar portal. It also allowed citizens to use a virtual ID that could be shared with all agencies, including the government, rather than the 12-digit Aadhaar ID, lending it more privacy. The next question that is being asked is, has the decision to provide a virtual ID made the Aadhaar more complicated for the masses? How many of the citizens will actually use the virtual ID? Wouldn’t there be a large section which is still vulnerable? While the concept of providing every Indian a unique ID was hailed by all, it was the manner of it being made compulsory to avail services — right from the distribution of subsidies, to paying income tax to purchasing mobile SIM cards and insurance or even procuring a death certificate — that made it controversial. Giving out the ID for such services so rampantly also exposed it to misuse by fraudsters. The issue has reached the apex court, which is hearing a slew of petitions relating to privacy issues around Aadhaar, including whether privacy is a fundamental right. On October 30, the Supreme Court referred all Aadhaar related cases to a five-judge Constitution bench. The Court, on December 15, extended the deadline to link Aadhaar with insurance policies, mutual funds holding and mobile phones to March 31 this year. The next hearing is scheduled on January 17. This is not the first time that issues of Aadhaar data breach have been raised. In July last year, there have been reports that customer data of a telecom firm, comprising sensitive details of millions of its users, including their Aadhaar numbers, was leaked online. Even then, there was a demand from experts that India needs to strengthen its privacy laws in line with the 2012 recommendations of the Justice AP Shah-led group of experts on privacy. In its report, the panel had said that a framework on the right to privacy in India must include privacy-related concerns around data protection on the internet, appropriate protection from unauthorised interception, audio and video surveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy including DNA as well as physical privacy. In the absence of strict privacy laws, intimate details of citizens can easily fall into the hands of fraudsters, which need to be avoided at all costs. Even the staunchest of opponents to Aadhaar feel that the government is unlikely to back away from continuing to insist on Aadhaar ID for most benefits and services unless the top court comes out with some severe strictures. Certain countries, however, have backtracked on such initiatives after discovering flaws in it. Reports say the UK scrapped its biometric identification plan in 2010 and destroyed the associated database. Meanwhile, the Social Security Number in the US is not biometric and is not used for basic services such as phones and credit cards that can lead to mass surveillance and breach of privacy. Moreover, countries like Germany do not impose biometric identification to deliver public services. It can be argued that the situation in India is different, given the rampant leakages in the subsidy system, which calls for a more foolproof identification system.

Be it the launch of his political memoir (third book in the series) in October last year or his bold address at the Aligarh Muslim University on founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s 200th birthday, Mukherjee chooses his words and events carefully. The former president is all set to visit Bangladesh on January 14 on a three-day trip. Needless to emphasise, he enjoys enormous goodwill in the neighbouring country. Held in very high esteem from the days of Bangladesh’s struggle for liberation, his fan following , cutting across party lines, is simply huge. Incidentally, the native place of Mukherjee's parents-in-law is on the other side of the border, and he obviously has several close relatives living there. That apart, Pranab babu has earned this goodwill by sheer hard work and undivided attention to the well-being of Bangladesh in redressing issues pertaining to Indo-Bangladesh relations. His contribution can be called phenomenal in major contentious issues concerning India and Bangladesh. The veteran Congress leader held several ministerial portfolios in the government of India - external affairs, finance, defence etc. That notwithstanding, he never took his eyes off the happenings in Bangladesh and always used his good offices, in all seriousness, and on all occasions requiring effective intervention. Right from Bangladesh's independence war in 1971, Pranab babu has always been proactive and lending help whenever required - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return from imprisonment, his installation as the prime minister, the tragic assassination and the trail of sensational developments impinging on India’s geo-political landscape due to rise in power of pro-Pakistani, Right reactionary forces who usurped power by facilitating a military coup and exterminating Mujib. It’s is believed Mukherjee proved to be a sheet anchor to the bereaved family of Sheikh Mujib at the time of grief and stood as a great pillar of strength to them. He was also the bridge between the family members and former Indian PM Indira Gandhi, comprehending and reacting to the events unfolding in Dhaka . The bloody coup was followed by counter-coups that took a huge toll and pushed Bangladesh into a turbulent time. Successive regimes, imposition of martial law, general Hussain Mohammad Ershad's rise and Ziaur Rahman's assassination were hallmarks of Bangladesh contemporary history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The man who held the hand of the distressed nation and at the same time took into account India’s security interests, is none other than Mukherjee. Although Sheikh Hasina (in her earlier stint) eventually came to power and was voted out after five years, Pranab Mukherjee maintained good relations with all and helped solve age-old problems of water-sharing and the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs ) accord that facilitated the return thousands of Chakma refugees to Bangladesh. In brief, whenever Bangladesh ran into rough weather, Mukherjee steadied the ship and things remained on course keeping Indo-Bangla relations intact. Interestingly, opposition leaders in Bangladesh too have immense respect for Mukherjee and acknowledge his vision and hold over the nuances of Bangladeshi politics. Mukherjee will be in Bangladesh to attend a number of programmes, including the closing session of the \"International Bengali Literature Conference\". According to   news report, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina \"will inaugurate the three-day literature conference on Saturday (January 13) at Bangla Academy, while Mukherjee will be present at the closing ceremony of the conference on Monday (January 15), as the chief guest\". He will also be flown in to Chittagong on January 15 to be honoured with a D Litt degree by the Chittagong University. In Chittagong , Mukherjee is also expected to be accorded a civic reception. On his part, Mukherjee will present a cheque on behalf of the Indian high commissioner to the Preetilata Trust in furtherance of its activities . Significantly , Mukherjee will also visit the memorial of Surya Sen aka Masterda, the famous revolutionary, known for the Chittagong armoury case. In Dhaka, he is scheduled to deliver the convocation address at the East West University and the Nikhil Bongo Sahitya Sammelan. So far, no meetings have been fixed with any political leaders. It’s assessed that abundant caution is being exercised so as to keep Mukherjee away from any political event, lest it is wrongly interpreted since the general elections in Bangladesh are due at the end of 2018 or early next year. On the whole, the visit is likely to go a long way in reinforcing ties between India and Bangladesh ensuring that at least there is one immediate neighbour who can be relied upon and vice-versa. His presence on the Bangladeshi soil will also encourage secular and pro-liberation forces to rally around Sheikh Hasina, which in effect, will help neutralise communal and divisive forces.  ","date":"2018-01-13","tag":"Sheikh Hasina,India-Bangladesh ties,Bangladesh,Pranab Mukherjee","title":"Why Dhaka is gearing up to greet Pranab Mukherjee","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-bangladesh-visit-india-bangladesh-ties-sheikh-hasina/story/1/21725.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15323},{"author":"Nooreen Sarna","content":"When four of the   of the Supreme Court decide to hold a press conference to discuss internal disagreements, as they did on the morning of January 12, one   it was not an easy decision to make. One   that it was made under advisement and not carelessly or hurriedly. And one wonders how a schism of this magnitude can heal itself, without the independence of the institution being compromised, and in the absence of any rules or conventions to address factionalism in a collegium. The need for transparency in the functioning of the higher judiciary cannot be emphasised enough. The institution, while entirely unelected, wields a disproportionate amount of power. Constitutional amendments carrying the approval of Parliament and a majority of the state legislatures can turn to dust in the Supreme Court. Additionally, its members are (almost) uniquely difficult to remove from their posts; the process of impeachment being complicated, time-consuming and highly political. The   held at justice J Chelameswar’s house brought to the fore certain questions about the judiciary’s relationship with transparency in its functioning. First, why are there no internal safeguards to deal with administrative issues in the functioning of the Supreme Court? The fact that discussions among the five senior-most judges repeatedly failed, and that a press conference was held out of frustration rather than convention, highlights a lack of structure in the administrative functioning of the Supreme Court. It seems as though there are no intermediate steps to settle administrative or even disciplinary issues in our multi-tiered judiciary. In the higher judiciary, transfers on disciplinary grounds are not common and, naturally, at the Supreme Court, this is not an option. The remote threat of impeachment is the only way to correct or direct judicial conduct. However, impeaching proceedings cannot be instituted by other judges of the Supreme Court and can hardly be termed as remedial in nature.   For an institution considered to be self-governing and supreme, we find that, in situations of internal conflict, there is no structure for internal solutions, and recourse to the media and, possibly, political bodies becomes inevitable. Second, how do we trust that other decisions of this collegium have been made on objective grounds? The Supreme Court has 25 judges currently. Two appointments have already been made by this very collegium,  this past week, and more appointments may well follow here and for the High Courts. In the absence of a truly transparent appointment process, we cannot be certain that voting will not take place according to other prejudices and that the voting pattern won’t reflect other divisions. This is not to question the integrity of the four judges at the press conference (who constitute a majority of the collegium), but rather to say that dangerous conclusions are left to be drawn in the absence of public information available about the functioning of the collegium. And third, will we only see transparency in times of dissent? Is the judiciary picking and choosing when to be transparent? There must be transparency in administrative functioning of the Supreme Court, including in issues of allocation of matters to certain benches. This transparency should not be brought in only when there is a disagreement among the judges - it makes it akin to a kind of whistle-blowing, wholly dependent on the conscience and state of mind of the whistle-blower. This is not to say that there was no good reason to address the public about the deadlock in administrative functioning in the Supreme Court. For a body like the judiciary and the role it plays in our democracy, a show of transparency cannot and should not be sporadic. It should not open itself up to allegations of being motivated. Any efforts made at introducing transparency should be capable of serving as lasting precedents.","date":"2018-01-12","tag":"National Medical Council row,Dipak Misra,CJI,Supreme Court","title":"Supreme Court judges' revolt: Hard-hitting questions for Indian judiciary","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent/story/1/21713.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15324},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"A lot needs to be said about the historic day when four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court on January 12  of democracy - the media - to convey that the third pillar - the judiciary - is currently facing immense threat. The only time India faced such a crisis was during the Emergency. As the legal reporter for India Today TV, I have been asked by many people about what led to the day's events. How did things come to a head? And where will this lead to in the coming times? I will try and answer them in this piece: It's true that in the past few months, the judicial corridors have been abuzz about how power is increasingly being concentrated with the CJI court and the manner in which the administrative powers are exercised by the CJI. About hundred cases are listed before the CJI on any given day. Many judges have spoken about this in hushed tones, on how it is improper for the CJI to overturn the orders of the other benches because there is no intra court appeal in the Supreme Court. As someone who spends every day at the Supreme Court to report stories, I will admit, I have felt inhibited bringing to light some of these issues which need to be discussed in the open. The order of two-judge bench cannot be overturned by a three-judge bench unless the two-judge bench has referred the matter to a larger bench. These are some of the grievances which have been criticised. The issue of impropriety, however, is more serious: It is repeatedly pointed in the seven-page letter circulated by the judges on Friday that the way the CJI exercises his \"administrative powers\" is arbitrary. This phrase needs to be broken down and looked at. Administrative powers in the Supreme Court means how cases are allocated to benches. It's extremely crucial that the matters are allocated according to the roster and not haphazardly. The allegation made implies that the CJI is not following the rules and is allocating matters to a particular bench to get a predictable outcome. A crucial unsaid truth about the judiciary is that journalists and lawyers can always get a sense of the mood and inclination of judges. Political leanings of judges, if any, are also widely spoken of, off the record. These things can't be said on public fora. A social closeness to a political person does not necessarily mean that the judge is not being objective while handling a case. But it is very important for the fate of the case as to in front of which bench it is listed. It is a crucial aspect in the process of deliverance of justice. It is not merely administrative in nature. What led to the happenings of January 12 go back to events of November 10, 2017 when the seeds of the dissent were sown. It was the day when the CJI  of Justice Chelameswar to refer the MCI scam to the bench of top five judges. An ugly scene broke out in the Supreme Court, with Prashant Bhushan openly alleging that the CJI was involved in corruption. An angry Bhushan walked out of the court when he wasn't allowed to speak. An order was passed by the CJI bench reasserting that the Chief Justice of India is the master of the roster. Even to this day, sources say, justice Lokur and other judges of the Supreme Court met justice Chelameswar. Some statement was expected on that day too, however, the steam seemed to have fizzled out. A few days later, the plea was referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. He was given this matter despite the fact that he was part of the five-judge bench which overturned the order of justice Chelameswar. Justice Misra was   about the conduct of Prashant Bhushan. Some argued that the matter should have been referred to another bench in the spirit of fairness. As expected, justice Arun Mishra dismissed the plea of Prashant Bhushan and severely criticised his conduct. In a related petition, Rs 25 lakh was also imposed on Bhushan. The matter was settled then, but a hurricane began to brew. Then came the plea seeking investigation into the allegedly mysterious death of judge BH Loya, who was presiding over the CBI court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. The matter was again referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. One of the petitioners in the Loya case came to me and informed that a senior lawyer backed out from the case by saying nothing was going to happen in the matter. It was during this conversation at 11.10am that a source informed me of the press conference. Interestingly, while the press conference was taking place, the CJI court around 12 noon was informed of the developments. A whistle was sounded in the CJI court and the guards rushed in to escort the CJI out of the courtroom. The timing of this entire incident cannot be overlooked. The press conference took place during the working hours of the Supreme Court and the CJI had no clue about this development. The top four judges of the Supreme Court rose up at around 11am and headed to the residence of Justice Chelameswar. Many legal experts today sound surprised with the developments of the day. They seem to have missed the frustration and the discontent brewing in the power corridors of the judiciary. The push and pull of the collegium is not something new. But when top four judges of the Supreme Court see no recourse but to address the media, we are indeed in for troubled times. The disenchantment with the way top court is functioning is deep and pervasive. The underlying current is the interference of the executive with the judiciary. When top judges of the Supreme Court say that democracy is under threat, we must take it seriously. When media shy judges are compelled to address a mob of press and speak openly, imagine the discontent and the helplessness festering within. The day shall go down in history when a clarion call was made for change and accountability. How it impacts the CJI and Parliament, the people of the country have a right to know and want an accountable judiciary.","date":"2018-01-13","tag":"National Medical Council row,CJI,Supreme Court,Dipak Misra","title":"Why rebellion at Supreme Court was in the offing","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent-justice-loya-mci-scam/story/1/21716.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15325},{"author":"Shantanu Mukharji","content":"With the advent of the new year, a group of office-bearers believed to be representing more than a dozen gurdwaras in the Canadian province of  , have jointly decided to ban officials representing India, its diplomats and others from entering the premises of the Sikh temples. The decision was taken at Gurdwara Jot Parkash Sahib in Brampton on December 30. Significantly, the pro forma statement mentioned “pursuant to the trespass to the Property Act (1990), the management of the Gurdwara Sahib reserves the right to ban entry to officials of the Indian government including but not limited to Indian elected officials , Indian consular officials and members of organisations who seek to undermine the Sikh nation and Sikh institution ( )\". The statement further stated: “Keeping in mind the interference of Indian consular and Indian government officials in the lives of Canadian Sikhs, gurdwara management committees have jointly taken the decision to bar the entry of these officials and members from gurdwaras across Canada. The presence of these officials makes members of the Sikh community uncomfortable due to their agenda of undermining the autonomy of Sikh institutions and organisations. It is our obligation to ensure the safety of the 'Sangat'.\" However, the statement clarified that the ban will be only on those visiting gurdwaras in their official capacity, not if they come in personal capacity. Meanwhile, pro-separatist activists, including Sukhminder Singh Hansra, have welcomed the decision alleging that officials were directly infiltrating into the Sikh affairs in Canada. This development is very  and, unless remedial measures are not taken without further delay, may give boost to the Khalistani movement, already brewing in the West. Examining the statements issued by the Sikh entities, it's difficult to miss the disturbing trend. When they say that the presence of Indian government officials tend to undermine the autonomy of the Sikhs and make them uncomfortable, it’s difficult to assess as to which factors are responsible to make the Indian officials’ presence uncomfortable. This appears to give a clear signal to the government to keep off the Sikh affairs which are interpreted to be the exclusive privilege of the Sikh clerical organisations. Gurdwaras have been rendering great service not only to the Sikhs, but to the world at large and the Indian community in particular in foreign countries. So what went wrong? Is it a growing distance between Indian diplomatic missions and Sikh shrines? This gap must be bridged sooner than later. It’s possible that a certain segment of the alienated Sikhs are discontented as their names continue to figure in the \"blacklist\" of the consular wing for their alleged acts in Punjab thought to be anti-national. If such suspicions are true, it’s time to revisit the names afresh. In today’s world of global uncertainties, no group can be insulated from the national mainstream. A healing touch is perhaps called for. Any tough measure is likely to be met with equally tough reaction which may be counterproductive. Coincidentally, barely 14 days after the Canadian notifications, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast (SCCEC) and America Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (APGC) stated that 96 gurdwaras have decided to ban entry of Indian officials. The ban would also hold good to Nagar Kirtans or religious processions. American Sikh entities following suit to the Canadian decisions, make the situation a little more complex. And if such bans catch on to other parts of the world, then a major fire fighting exercise seems called for before it gets out of hand. This also calls for caution as the SCCEC and the AGPC combine is the largest umbrella organisation of the Sikhs in the US. It is further known that the decision has been reached with the support of US-based Sikh group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). In order to enforce their diktat, the Sikh bodies have also threatened to initiate legal proceedings against those Indian diplomats trying to breach the ban. On its part, any state, or in this case the government of India, cannot remain oblivious to the designs of the separatists to go on a propaganda offensive espousing their so-called cause. It has to come down heavily on the elements, now on a collision course, supporting the Khalistan movement. Having said this, it’s equally important to assuage the genuine grievances, if any, of those Sikhs who are provoked to resort to such a drastic course of action. It seems all Sikhs in Canada and in the US do not support the latest move to ban the entry of the Indian officials. If not for the active cooperation from the gurdwaras, it wouldn’t have been possible for the government of India to contain the Khalistani movement, at its peak in the 1990s. Both the gurdwaras and the high commissions/embassies had excellent relationships, churning out best possible results for the Sikhs and the Indian government representatives. The late Naresh Chandra, former US ambassador, appropriated best of collaboration with the gurdwara forces bringing in much-needed peace. There are multiple names in this regard who accomplished the task with dexterity and patience. Both the Canadian and US statements have a thrust in banning the consular officers. Probably that’s where it hurts most because it extends services to passport and visa services. If they are attended to on a case-to-case and genuine basis, more than half the problem is solved. Consular staff, therefore, perhaps needs to be more caring, sensitive and patient to assuage the disgruntlement. Presently, the Indian ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, is a Sikh and a seasoned diplomat. His officers manning the different consulates also carry huge experience and acumen. Similarly, India's high commissioner to Canada, Vikas Swarup, is most articulate and experienced in public and media dealings. They can walk the extra mile to prevail upon the Sikh bodies to rescind their orders in the larger interest of the country’s peace and sovereignty. Equally important is to pre-empt any probable evil design by the Pakistani forces, especially the ISI, unleashed to encourage the Khalistani forces. Frustrated by its self-aborted designs of Khalistani propaganda for the last so many years, Pakistani agencies may be attempting to stir yet another move to pinprick our security interests. Such a move must be averted for good, as time is running out.","date":"2018-01-12","tag":"India,Khalistani movement,US,Canada","title":"Why gurdwaras in Canada and US banned the entry of Indian officials","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sikh-gurdwaras-canada-ontario-ban-indian-officials-khalistani-movement-pakistan/story/1/21705.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15326},{"author":"Mohammad Behzad Fatmi","content":"Under the ongoing state of emergency, Turkey has issued yet another controversial   on December 24, 2017, granting immunity to civilians who were part of the mobs which suppressed the 2016 failed coup attempt against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Authorities say such a measure was necessary to protect those civilians who risked their lives to shield their elected government - on the night of July 15 and the early hours of July 16, 2016 - from putschists. But the decree is so vaguely worded that it is possible for one to interpret it as granting immunity from prosecution for actions that one may have taken post-July 15 or may take in the future against a government critic on the pretext of suppressing the continuation of events on the night of the coup.  Regardless of its gravity and profound detrimental effect on the rule of law in the country, such a step by the AKP government hardly took anyone by surprise. Over the past couple of years, there have been multiple   of the AKP government establishing private militias loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. One of the such prominent groups is   which allegedly had dozens of its men armed with semi-automatic rifles on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, assaulting and killing many of the renegade soldiers on the night of July 15, 2016. Interestingly, SADAT also stands accused of killing a number of innocent civilians on that fateful night in order to boost public anger and help the government create a victim narrative. The newly issued decree practically means that not only SADAT and a number of other shadowy outfits like it will not be punished for these crimes, but they will also not be brought to justice should they take law in their own hands in the future, in circumstances they argue were similar to that of July 15, 2016. This move has led many to believe that the government is preparing for an imminent clash between President Erdogan’s Islamist and Dogu Perincek’s ultranationalist camp who despite being contemptuous of each other formed an alliance in the aftermath of the coup attempt to purge state institutions of pro-western officials. Dogu Perincek was jailed in 2008 during the Ergenekon trials for plotting to overthrow the AKP government, but his conviction was   in 2014 when Erdogan started to target the Movement of Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. On stepping out of the prison complex he talked to the media waiting for him and   that he will dismantle the “regime of Tayyip Erdogans, Abdullah Guls, Fethullah Gulens”, referring to the perceived alliance between the AKP and the US-based cleric. Since then Perincek has been back in business growing the influence of his tiny far-left Patriotic Party on important state institutions, especially on the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK). The “Perincek group”, as the ultranationalist pro-Russian companions of Dogu Perincek are often referred to in the Turkish policy chattering circle, has been the biggest   of the massive purge of pro-Western officials from the TSK following the coup attempt in 2016. The meteoric growth in influence of an ultranationalist group which has always despised the Islamist-rooted AKP poses an existential threat to the Erdogan regime - and Erdogan knows it very well. On the other hand, many analysts see this move as Erdogan’s preparation for another “false flag operation” which will justify crackdown on the remaining few voices of dissent in the country - the way the July 15 events justified suppression of the Gulen Movement. Even though there is no effective opposition in the country, there are still pockets of resistance and/or potential rivals which Erdogan would like to neutralise. The likes of former president Abdullah Gul, a few defiant MPs from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), and of course the Perincek group are certainly not the type of forces Erdogan wants to accommodate in his vision of a totalitarian regime in Turkey. Regardless of whether Erdogan had the former or the later motive in his mind while drafting this decree, the situation that it may lead to cannot be peace and order - which Turkey needs desperately. It will certainly push the country towards chaos and instability, perhaps even towards a civil war.  ","date":"2018-01-11","tag":"Civil War,Racep Tayyip Erdogan,Coup Attempt,Turkey","title":"Is Turkey heading towards a civil war?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/turkey-controversial-decree-coup-attempt-racep-tayyip-erdogan-civil-war/story/1/21677.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15327},{"author":"Majid Hyderi","content":"There is still hope, but only for some. In the past six months, two verdicts from the apex court on two separate pleas seeking fresh probe - into the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and the killings of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s and early 2000s - have drawn massive comparisons. On January 10, the   decided to set up a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to look into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases in 1984, investigations into which were closed earlier. The apex court has also asked the Centre to suggest names for the proposed three-member panel, which will be headed by a former high court judge. The 1984 riots, which broke out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had claimed the lives of an estimated 8,000 people in Delhi and around the country. But then, if riots dating back to 1980s can be reinvestigated through an SIT, why is it declared “too late” for fresh investigations into the killings of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s? In July 2017, the apex court rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking fresh probe into the killing of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir. Dismissing the PIL filed by an NGO “Roots in Kashmir”, the apex court said it would be difficult to probe as evidence “is unlikely to be available”. \"Almost 27 years have gone by… Where will the evidence will come from? Such a plea should have been moved long time ago,\" the   had observed. The petitioners had moved the court saying that they need a \"sense of justice\" in the case. \"The community has legitimate expectations. The successive governments have repeatedly made fake promises that the Pandits could return (to homeland). No one is protecting them,\" they prayed. The dismissal of the case buried all hopes for justice for the survivors of the systematic bloodbath. Apart from the outraged Pandit community, even a human rights group - largely run by Kashmiri Muslims - had sharply reacted to the court decision. The Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society in a statement had  : \"The Supreme Court order is a complete departure from established law that ‘crime never dies’, and there exists no time limitation for justice under Indian and international law with regard to serious crimes such as murder.\" The rights group observed that “killings of Kashmiri Pandits, other minorities and all violence in Jammu and Kashmir have never been fairly and credibly investigated”, adding, “Thus far, Jammu and Kashmir has faced widespread, systemic violence, largely at the hands of the Indian state.” Three decades on, the killings of Pandits, continue to be an unsolved mystery. For the all-resourceful government, it took around two decades to just consolidate contradictory figures of the killings. As per a first comprehensive report compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 2008, from 1989 onwards, 209 Kashmiri Pandits were killed. As many as 109 killed in 1990 alone. According to this   in , while 140 cases were registered at police stations across Kashmir, chargesheets had been filed in only 24 cases. In 115 cases, the perpetrators are yet to be identified. Even the first reported killing of a Kashmiri Pandit remains unsolved. According to the police, the first Pandit to be killed was a woman named Prabhavati from Budgam. She was killed in Srinagar on March 14, 1989, by unidentified gunmen, whose identity could never be established. Of all the districts of Kashmir province, the summer capital of Srinagar, as per the police records, had witnessed the largest number of killings  - 82 - within two years of the onset of the armed insurgency. Apart from individual target killings, in some instances, the minority community people were massacred. These include the Sangrampora massacre in which seven persons were killed during on the night of March 21-22 in 1997 in Budgam, 23 were killed in Wandhama on January 25, 1998 and 24  murdered in Nadimarg on March 24, 2003. According to the police, the perpetrators of the Wandhama massacre remain untraced. There are slight contradictions even in the official figures pertaining to the killings. In March 2010, the then government told the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that 219 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed by militants since 1989, , and not 209,  as previously reported by the police. But a year later in 2011, the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a Srinagar-based organisation, said at least 399 Pandits had been killed. There cannot be a bigger pain than the exodus of the bereaved community out of their homeland. And this wound has been festering in the absence of a fair probe, something which could clear the air and lead to the severest punishment for the perpetrators. It could equally contribute in reconciliatory efforts aimed at harmonious return of the Pandits to their homeland. If investigations into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases were closed without investigation, probe into killings of Pandits never took off. For the Sikh community, it has been an unfortunate case of justice delayed (even as the latest Supreme Court decision revived fresh hopes), but for the Pandits,  it remains yet another grievous instance of justice denied.","date":"2018-01-11","tag":"Justice,Supreme Court,Kashmiri Pandits,1984 anti-Sikh riots","title":"If 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms can be reopened, why not Kashmiri Pandit killings?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sit-probe-kashmiri-pandits-exodus-supreme-court-justice-delayed-denied/story/1/21666.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15328},{"author":"Hriday Ranjan","content":"Every time an actor announces the decision to join politics, my curiosity is piqued. We are a nation that worships stars. But when it comes to elections, we show them the ballot finger. Since the ‘50s, film stars in India have, without hesitation, hopped on to the next, logical platform: politics. According to a   entry, India has three times the number of actor-politicians than most countries, followed only by USA and Philippines (I wonder what’s happening there!). Election results for actors have been far from blockbusting. Indian film stars have realised the bitter truth that winning votes is a lot tougher than bashing up villains. In fact, Sunil Dutt might be the only major film star who had a long, successful political career — winning five terms and also serving as Union minister for youth affairs and sports in the UPA government. Govinda did nothing of remote importance as a politician; the highlight of his political career being the moment when he begged Sonia Gandhi to become the prime minister — much like the climax of a certain David Dhawan-Kader Khan film. Hema Malini’s political career has been as spectacular as her daughter Esha Deol’s film career — with reports of villagers protesting outside her office since they saw zero development under the Dream Girl’s leadership. Hemaji is now seen as a representative for Kent RO. Actress Jayaprada’s career started with the Telugu Desam Party in undivided Andhra Pradesh; she then switched to Samajwadi Party in UP, and finally launched her own party. Chiranjeevi, the Telugu megastar, too, started his own party in 2008. In 2011, in a move that would give Chanakya a stroke, he merged it with the Congress. And then there’s the murky history  Amitabh Bachchan and late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors scam. It is not only film actors who have dipped their fingers in the hot oil of politics. TV actors, too, have tried their luck. Smriti Irani is a success story, but other TV actors have found less success. Actors who essayed the roles of Ram, Krishna, Draupadi and Ravan (!) in mythological shows have contested elections in India. Shekhar Suman joined the Congress, lost an election, and returned to TV. Rakhi Sawant launched her own party targeted at the ordinary citizen, called Rashtriya Aam Party. So absurd is the association of stars with politics that Salman Khan has campaigned for both BJP and Congress. Bhai has gone so far as to campaign for the Sri Lankan president. Why?  Many actors such as Amitabh Bachhan and Govinda have gracefully resigned from politics, whereas the other have faced defeat, or been invited as Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. Barring Kerala, every Indian state has had actors chancing their luck in politics. Overall, the success rate of film stars in politics has been — to put it accurately — like Fardeen Khan’s career. However, this is only true in the northern parts of India. Down South, film stars have had blockbuster careers as politicians. People from north India are often baffled at the sycophancy surrounding film stars in Tamil Nadu, and attribute it to emotional overtures. It could be driven by emotion – like the temples built for actresses Khushboo and Namitha suggest. But politics is deeply intertwined with cinema in Tamil Nadu. The three largest political icons in Tamil Nadu are film stars — MG Ramachandran (actor), Karunanidhi (screenwriter) and Jayalalitha (actor). In undivided Andhra Pradesh, then megastar NT Rama Rao founded the Telugu Desam Party and became the chief minister of the state. In December 2017, Rajinikanth announced that he will contest the next Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In many ways, Tamil Nadu politics is starkly different from politics in any other part of the country. Thalaiva’s decision to bring about “spiritual politics” might have raised eyebrows in any other part of the country, but in Tamil Nadu, nobody batted an eyelid. The contribution of film stars to Tamil consciousness is rooted in the philosophies of Periyar and the self-respect movement. The state has a high Human Development Index (HDI) score when it comes to parametres like primary education and healthcare. In a nation that is slanting dangerously close to religion year after year, Tamil Nadu’s Dravidian politics has washed its hands of religion and caste. In fact, Tamil Nadu’s leaders are proud and fierce atheists — from Karunanidhi to Kamal Haasan. Thalaiva has his work cut out. Like in the film   Thalaiva is entering an arena with two established players — the AIADMK and the DMK;  Yet, Rajinikanth is not your average film star getting into politics. He is said to have 55,000 fan clubs in the state, besides a diasporic network of fans. There are legendary stories of his humility, and his unique tradition of returning distributors’ money for films that tank at the box office. In a state that has largely fulfilled its basic needs, Rajinikanth needs to deliver something else this time: faith. But as Thalaiva himself says in   “Once I take up a job, I don’t leave it without completing it... and I don’t take up a job that I can't complete.” Rajini can.","date":"2018-01-11","tag":"Tamil Nadu Assembly,Tamil Nadu,Rajinikanth","title":"Why Rajinikanth joining politics is perfect","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-tamil-nadu-politics-lok-sabha-polls-2019/story/1/21673.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15329},{"author":"Harmeet Shah Singh","content":"Uncovering secrets in an ecosystem as complex as India's is replete with monumental challenges. One came out last week when   newspaper reported that personal details of citizens could be bought for as little as Rs 500 via WhatsApp. Rachna Khaira, the journalist who broke the story, explained how unknown agents were able to provide access to names, addresses, photos and email aliases from what is advertised as Aadhaar's impregnable database. Her report compounded concerns over the security of the citizens' privileged details at a time when risks of identity fraud have mounted the world over. For cyber criminals, personal information is a gateway to potential scams. Khaira's report was expected to stimulate the UIDAI to generate an environment of confidence and safety when   has been declared a fundamental right. It didn't, unfortunately. Instead, the UIDAI went on a power trip. It filed a police complaint against the reporter and her newspaper among others. Its action rhymed with what is now a pervasive trend to spin unpalatable news reports, no matter how vital they might be to public interest. Investigative journalism is a great public service. As an editor of India Today TV's Special Investigation Team, I can say with conviction that investigative reports stand tall when political stories dominate regular television rundowns and fake news floats freely on social media. This form of journalism is centred on firm impact and not around TV ratings or digital hits. It sets a stellar example of agenda-setting reporting. India Today's enterprising SIT cadre has itself revealed massive scandals, underground economy, organised gangs, education scams, child labour, medical frauds, terror financing and a lot more over the past one year. These journalists have mostly gone undercover to their subjects — and caught them confessing to wrongdoings on hidden cameras. Had it not been for the SIT's exposé of a widespread   in Bihar, India simply wouldn't know about the scale of malpractices inside the state's educational institutions. Its startling reporting on the business of toxic hospital waste brought to light some of the worst forms of environmental and child labour. Our SIT busted black-money mafias across a variety of sectors in the wake of demonetisation. And when this Special Investigation Team broke a mega-exclusive on the Pakistani funding of the Hurriyat in Jammu and Kashmir last year, multiple government agencies swung into action in multiple states. The story set national news agenda for weeks that followed. What drives these courageous investigations is a mission to serve the people's right to information. But now imagine a situation when an investigative reporter is intimidated by the threat of trial for impersonation and cheating. It would suffocate the entire genre of investigative journalism. Remember, undercover reporting is a technique investigative journalists adopt widely across the world in order to get access that would otherwise be declined. They would pose as businesspersons, sport agents, financiers, patients, middlemen and so forth with a sole goal to get the information out for the larger public interest. But what has happened over the first weekend of 2018 is a vicious kick in the teeth of investigative journalism itself. In the world's largest democracy, journalist Rachna Khaira is charged under the IPC's sections related to impersonation, cheating and forgery for exposing glaring holes in the UIDAI's privacy-protection armour. Instead of putting its house in order, the UIDAI has tried to shoot the messenger down. But it's not all doom and gloom. For now, India's media fraternity has stood united against this spiteful tactic to suppress stories that hold power to account. But let's not stop here. Let this campaign be sustained in order to preserve, nourish and protect investigative journalism — that insatiable quest for the realities of power in the face of powerful opposition.","date":"2018-01-09","tag":"Aadhaar,Aadhaar data breach,UIDAI","title":"Why UIDAI's FIR against The Tribune journalist is a kick in the teeth of investigative journalism","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uidai-fir-aadhaar-data-breach-mass-surveillance-investigative-journalism/story/1/21632.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15330},{"author":"Javed Anwer","content":"Aadhaar didn't start as surveillance technology. While the concept of a unique ID for all was fuzzy even in the beginning — around 2009 — it was meant to be an authentication technology that would plug leaks in India's welfare schemes. The idea behind Aadhaar seemed well-meaning, but the way it was designed and hurriedly pushed made it evident to keen observers that it was not going to end up well. There were many problems with it, but of particular note was the way Aadhaar would give the government and bureaucrats unnecessary power over individual citizens. Instead of being a tool of inclusion, Aadhaar would be a tool of exclusion. Even in the early stages, it was difficult to imagine that one day the Aadhaar would turn into Frankenstein's monster. In 2018, it has become a tool that has the potential to put every citizen in this country under surveillance. The argument that Aadhaar is a tool to end corruption in India surfaced earlier this decade. After 2012, and exceedingly after 2014, Aadhaar grew in ways it was not meant to when it was conceived. This has happened as the UIDAI — the agency in charge of the Aadhaar programme — acquired unaccountable power over the people of India, and made its operations as secretive and opaque as it can. Fun fact 1: Do you know that under Aadhaar Act 2016, the UIDAI has virtually no accountability, but has provisions that stop Aadhaar users, that is ordinary Indians, from filing any complaint against it in court for the misuse of the UID? Fun fact 2: Do you know Aadhaar was never meant to be an ID card? In the initial days, Aadhaar was linked to government's welfare schemes. For instance, it was made mandatory for issuing ration to all those who held a ration card. This despite the fact that the Supreme Court, in its interim order, told the government that having the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory in any way. Post-2015, all hell broke loose. By now, Aadhaar is no longer just technology to authenticate the identity of those entitled to benefits under government welfare schemes. It transformed into an authentication technology for almost everything Indians do. In 2018, if you go by the directives issued by the government, you have to link your Aadhaar to almost everything you own or do. Aadhaar is no longer required only for welfare schemes, like obtaining a ration card, but also if you want to continue using your phone. It is “required”, although not yet mandatory, for availing banking services until March 31 because Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to it. Aadhaar is required for registering births in many parts of India, and even deaths. Aadhaar is required if you want an LPG connection, even if you don't intend to take subsidies. And Aadhaar is required if you want to send your children to school or if you want your degree, and for treatment at many hospitals — even if you are an accident victim and are brought to the emergency with severe head trauma! This is just the beginning. If the Supreme Court dismisses the current challenge to link Aadhaar with every aspect of our lives, be ready to see more Aadhaar in your life. Even simple tasks like buying airline tickets or making hotel reservations or renting homes will soon necessitate Aadhaar authentication. It is important to understand why Aadhaar has become so pervasive. By linking the UID with children’s admissions in private schools, or by linking it with private data, such as your phone number, the government is not saving any money. It is not curbing or cracking down on corruption. It is just putting in place an infrastructure: arguably the world's biggest surveillance apparatus that a country has built to keep an eye on its citizens. Sure, the United States’ NSA will still be bigger, but then NSA for now watches only non-Americans. In the recent years, Aadhaar has metamorphosed into the perfect surveillance tool. It allows the government to collect and record every piece of data that Indians generate as they go about their lives. By storing this data in one place, with Aadhaar as its key, the government will be able to theoretically track and build profiles of every Indian with the UID. There is the argument that we already leave a digital trail whenever we use a phone, carry out a banking transaction, book an air or train ticket or get an LPG connection, and so it doesn't matter that Aadhaar is linked with the service. That is true. But by linking every detail of our existence with Aadhaar, the government puts all of this data in one place and makes it incredibly easy to monitor, record and use. Across the world, governments seek to gain more control over citizens. When they have achieved some level of control, they also abuse it, as history tells us. Even if the original intent is benign, never in the history has a government built surveillance apparatus and not abused it. If we allow Aadhaar to grow unchecked, controlled and managed by an agency with no accountability — and it is the UIDAI that filed an FIR to go after people who pointed out Aadhaar flaws — the results are not going to be pretty.

The Gayoom government would be sending its foreign minister Mohamed Asim and defence minister Adam Shareef to India later this month. The proposed dates of Asim and Shareef's visit are January 11 and January 16, respectively. The two visits would be important events for the India-Maldives bilateral relations and a major diplomatic bid by the Gayoom government to build bridges with India after a series of unsavoury episodes. Currently, the India-Maldives relations are frigid on account of a host of incidents in the recent past such as Maldives signing its first-ever Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China despite its avowed \"India-first\" policy, the Maldivian media owing allegiance to President Gayoom severely criticising India in general and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, and restricting Indian envoy Akhilesh Mishra's movements in Maldives. President Gayoom is dispatching his foreign and defence ministers to India in a last-ditch effort to mollify India, greatly hurt by a series of provocations from Maldives, some of which have been mentioned above. Though these ministers would obviously be meeting their Indian counterparts, Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman, their main agenda would be to meet the big man himself, PM Modi. The course the relationship between the two countries takes would all depend on whether Modi is willing to meet the two senior Maldivian ministers. If he does so, it would be construed as a big concession from India and denote that the Modi government is willing to forgive and forget. But as of now the indications are that Modi won't give them an appointment, citing his busy schedule considering that the budget session of Parliament is scheduled to begin from January 29, with the tabling of the Economic Survey. The MEA has confirmed that the Maldivian foreign minister will be calling on PM Modi on January 11 evening. Significantly, Maldives happens to be the only neighbouring country which Modi hasn't visited. He was scheduled to visit the country in March 2015 but cancelled the trip at the last minute after the Gayoom government arrested former president Mohammed Nasheed, a friend of India, under trumped up charges of terrorism and sedition. Since then, India-Maldives relations have been strained. What has greatly upset the Modi government is that the Maldivian media known to be have allegiance with President Gayoom, has criticised PM Modi for his pro-Hindu politics and called him names. Maldives, a tiny nation with a population of just about 4 lakh people (in contrast Delhi's Karol Bagh has a population of over 5 lakh), is a hundred per cent Muslim nation. The   is watching the developments closely and doesn't want Modi to meet the Maldivian ministers. India would be giving a mouthful to the visiting Maldivian ministers over the issues mentioned above and would like to know what concrete actions the Gayoom government has taken or proposes to take in the near future to take care of Indian interests and sensitivities. For example, India would like to see reversal of some India-centric policies that the Gayoom government has implemented over past few weeks. India would like to have a firm commitment from Maldives that it wouldn't unleash its media to poke India in the eye. Some of the statements from Gayoom himself have muddied the waters. Gayoom has of late made several remarks at his public functions wherein he has castigated India without naming the country. The Indian position is that that such remarks, coming from the head of the government, have been too harsh and detrimental to the larger cause of good relations between the two SAARC member states. India would also like to have a commitment from the Gayoom government to have an inclusive domestic policy wherein the Opposition is taken on board, not victimised and repressed as is the trend. India would like to have an assurance that Maldives won't do anything to gag democracy and accord due space to the Opposition given the Maldivian presidential election are due in about eight months. The biggest talking point of India will be to convey a message that Maldives shouldn't play the China card in its dealings with India, something which another SAARC nation Nepal has been doing for decades. While India cannot tell Maldives not to have close relations with any foreign power, including China, New Delhi would be making it clear that Maldives would be playing the China versus India strategic game at its own peril. India is quite upset over the fact that while its envoy in Maldives Akhilesh Mishra is having his movements severely restricted, the Chinese ambassador is being given a special treatment. India is concerned over the manner in which Maldives has on the one hand been wooing China but on the other hand tightening screws on India. Under the Gayoom regime, the Chinese strategic footprints in Maldives have been growing larger and larger while India has continuously been cold-shouldered. The social media trends mirror this situation very well. For example, while workers in Maldives from other countries have been living in shanties, the Chinese have been building plush permanent structures for their workers. But India has its own leverages with regards to Maldives, especially considering the fact that it's much closer to Maldives geographically than powers like China. Also, Gayoom is not unmindful of the Indian leverages. That's why he is sending his ministers on a diplomatic mission.

That is a victory for women, democracy, as well as secularism, but not many people see it that way yet. Let us consider the plight of the average woman in the world today, with US President Donald Trump also being charged with sexual assault in a lot of anecdotal references. Let us also consider the plight of the average Muslim in India, and now consider the plight of women in this light. There is no case one can argue in favour of the men, the husbands of the country, with regard to an issue of their wives’ rights, especially in the case of a right that is well known to be necessary for any human being, not just a Muslim woman. In the 1980s, when Rajiv Gandhi interfered in the famous  case, there were protests that the interference was setting up a dangerous precedent. Thirty years later, the politics of polarisation has resulted in a short, but dangerous history of demolitions, riots, burning of trains, and attacks on non-vegetarians. Now that the government in power, which may well have benefited from the said bloody history, is trying to undo the damage, people (mostly men) are protesting against the new law. They cite that it would be contrary to the prescriptive morals of their way of life. And from their point of view, they may even be right. But the fact remains that a large number of women suffer and have suffered due to the obvious disproportionate distribution of rights between men and women when it comes to the subject of breaking marriages. Some would even say that divorce should be outlawed in Hindu societies, which is also symptomatic of the lack of rights women share globally. The other extreme would say that divorce is fine, but that only men have exclusive rights with regard to divorce. How on earth can one justify the ending of a marriage so arbitrarily when even relationships are seemingly impossible to let go of in an arbitrary fashion? The question of the legitimacy of the bill to criminalise triple talaq is not even relevant here. An appeal to one’s most basic shred of a conscience is enough to justify the legitimacy of women’s rights. Have we all disrespected women so strongly for so long that one has to   that women and men should have equal rights to say the least? Whether this new policy and corresponding law of the Hindu-majority government will be beneficial in the practical sphere or not is subject to the tides of time, but the sheer legitimacy of this law is unquestionable in most commonly held views on ethics. The rest is our choice, sociological or ideological. Secularism implies non-interference in social matters pertaining to religion. However, women’s rights along with many other rights ordinarily considered fundamental to democratic societies are more important for the larger sake of secularism itself. How can it be that through non-interference in social laws the government can protect social rights? Interference of any sort in the metaphysical sphere of things in understandable, but Lord Benedict’s arguments for criminalising Sati a few centuries in the past under the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy, one of India’s premier intellectuals, is as valid today as it was then. If one sees exploitation occurring around them, the first reaction should be to interfere, as positively as possible, to curb that exploitation. The BJP government may hold allegations of inhumanity against them, but a step towards egalitarianism is far more human than burning women alive for dowry, arbitrarily breaking marriages which are alleged to be made in heaven, or forcing girls into child labour. The very fact that the Opposition is not opposing this bill severely is enough proof that even our liberally hated politicians of Delhi are synergistically showing signs of reform. When the Congress majority government of the 1950s decided to implement a uniform codification of all personal law with respect to Hindu law, the then right wing had decided to oppose such change. Now, it is believed that the right-wing government in power may be stepping further towards a uniform civil code for all. Uniformity of social policing notwithstanding, the fate of women is an issue in its own right, globally, and should not be denigrated to a low-key fight for communal compartmentalising. Demonetisation may have allegedly been a failure. However, politically it benefitted Modi, on account of the divide that it created between the rich and poor of our nation. Triple Talaq may be a failure in reality, but it has added to the divide between Muslim women and men. If men do not wish for militaristic feminism in the manner of communist militarism between haves and have-nots, they should tread this line further, namely that of the middle path, protecting women rights without allowing rogue elements to twist the debate in their patriarchal favour. Sooner or later, the consciousness of matriarchy shall step in and destroy the absurd injustices of a thousand years. But until then, the men, leaders, minority spokespersons and such should be forewarned.

The SOR says, “The judgment vindicated the position taken by the government that talaq-e-biddat is against Constitutional morality, the dignity of women and principles of gender equity guaranteed under the Constitution.” This, according to the SOR, was in contradistinction to the view of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which wanted to issue advisories. The very wording of the SOR displays a sense of triumph against the Muslim community, a sort of posturing by the government over the Muslim community through the bill. The government’s reading of the Supreme Court judgment is hopelessly misleading. The minority view (of ex CJI JS Khehar and Abdul Nazeer) was that instant talaq is a recognised Islamic practice and it was for the Parliament to intervene if it wanted to. The need for government legislation follows from here. The split majority struck down instant talaq for different reasons. One view was that it was contrary to Islamic law (Kurien), the other that it violated constitutional equality (Nariman–Lalit). The government’s flowery reference to constitutional morality and gender \"equity\" is based on this latter minority view because the second majority judgment simply declared it contrary to Islamic law. The bill emanates from the imagination of the government to (a) showcase Muslim law as unjust and (b) instrument a careless and vindictive law to break up Muslim marriages. Once the court declared instant talaq to be illegal and unconstitutional, the simple declaration in Clause 3 outlawing any form of instant triple talaq was enough: “Any pronouncement of talaq by a person upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever is illegal.” At first blush, Clause 3 gives the broad impression that “talaq” itself is illegal. Of course, “talaq” in the definition clause limits the bill to talaq-ebiddat or all forms of instant talaq. A clever presentation — too clever. But after the SC declaration that instant talaq is illegal, this meant the marriage subsists with all the obligations of Islamic law. Here the bill takes an “ugly turn”. It assumes that although instant talaq is illegal, but with its pronouncement, the marriage itself has broken down requiring remedial action. It gives the right to subsistence allowance and custody of children to the wife similar to divorce proceedings when marriages break up. The bill assumes that the illegal declaration of talaq by the husband virtually breaks up the marriage requiring questions of subsistence allowance to be adjudicated by a Magistrate. In other words, the declaration of instant talaq accelerates a marriage breakdown when the real purpose of the Supreme Court and, supposedly the bill was that the marriage remains alive and well. But the bill regards the very utterance of instant divorce as a kind of breakdown or judicial separation requiring magisterial intervention on maintenance and custody. This is the evil effect of the bill to break the marriage rather than cement it. Why “subsistence allowance”? If instant talaq is illegal, the wife is lawfully wedded with full privileges of a wife. “Subsistence allowance” is a step down — legislative cruelty denying the wife and children total rights. How absurd can this be? A fully wedded wife not legally divorced by her husband will be entitled to only adjudicated subsistence for herself and her children. This part of the bill is antigender, anti-SC judgment, anti-common sense and directed to break up marital relations. The fully wedded wife would run off to a Magistrate for what happens in judicial separation or divorce for relief. Husband and wife are put in legal attrition Finally, the criminality provisions are provocative and irresponsible. Clause 7 means that if the husband utters the instant talaq words, he would commit “an offence which is cognisable and non-bailable”. This means he can be arrested by police and remain in investigative custody unless the Magistrate intervenes. Is this designed to cure the marriage or perpetuate discord? Everything illegal is not a crime. Making it criminal, distorts the relationship between parties. The BJP uses its majority in Lok Sabha to do what it likes. On December 20, 2017, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad answered that after the SC judgment, 99 cases of instant talaq were reported. Is that enough to punish the Muslim community, causing legal quarrels between husband and wife and sending the husband to jail for up to three years. The debate was sparse. The Opposition quiet. So what if they were in a minority, the Opposition should have torn apart the whole bill (not just the penal provisions). In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition put up a fight. But gradually it also caved in — agreeable to compromise on the pen provision not being cognisable and non-bailable. The bill was not passed in the Winter session. But it should be circulated for public opinion or, at least, sent to a select Parliamentary committee as demanded by some members. This is an unfair bill produced by BJP majoritarianism.

He belongs not just to the world of movies, but is part of folklore. He is a metaphor for the miracle we call films. His very entry brought a democratic ease to film. I remember Rajinikanth was a bus conductor. He was once asked by a journalist, “If you had not been a bus conductor-turned-film star, what would you have been?” Quick came the answer, “Oh, a smuggler or a bootlegger.” Rajini was emphasising the fundamental equality of all occupations in the informal economy, from where Kollywood scripts often originate. That was decades ago. When Rajinikanth announced he is going to join politics, start a new political party, the enthusiasm did not work out like the release of his films. The DMK and the AIADMK felt he was not real enough for politics. Many academic activists were even dismissive, arguing that Rajini had taken no real stands in politics. But the problem is a more complex one. Rajini is older. Maybe legends do not age, but Tamil Nadu as a society has. The golden age of politics and its creativity, reciprocity to film is over. Annadurai and MGR are gone, the DMK under Stalin appears a bit like a political still life. The DMK-AIADMK battles that dominated the last few decades create little excitement. In fact, the most exciting person in Chennai is Jayalalithaa. Even as a dead person, she could sweep the election. She has the charisma even as memory to make crowds hysterical and hysteria can flow like a religious current in this city. But what is more obvious than Jayalalithaa’s absence as presence is the emptiness of Tamil politics. Despite being a corrupt prima dona, Jaya had the makings of a Tamil deity. There is a touch of the lukewarm to Rajini’s entry. Probably English language newspapers are more deadpan about it. They make his entry sound like a benign Rotary club meeting. But once one hears Rajini in Tamil, he seems a different person, more in command, almost prophetic about the new digital constituencies he is planning to create. Rajini still offers the politics of hope Tamil Nadu so desperately needs. One break on this move reaching a cinematic climax is the political future of another great star, Kamal Haasan. Haasan too wants to enter politics and make a difference. His seems more the voice of the left, but one is not clear whether Haasan is speaking of his sympathisers on the left or of a need for a fully articulated leftist ideology. While both still stand like Achilles before their tents, Amit Shah and BJP seem busy. They realise the potential of the moment as all the big parties seems dormant. They realise that the creation of a Trojan horse would have a deadly effect, but one wonders whether Tamil Nadu would forgive any one for playing a Trojan horse in a cinematic sense. Tamil Nadu as a society has always been proud of its autonomy from Delhi. Even Modi at the height of his power cut little ice with Jayalalithaa. Yet it is the emptying of politics that haunts one. Tamil Nadu lacks a Periyaar, a Kamraj, a Rajaji and an Annadurai. Each could have mobilised the imagination. Today’s party leaders stand like Uriah Heaps, their very secondariness is so obvious.  The very emptiness of political space is begging Rajini to enter. He realises that he has to offer something new and that the newness of his politics has to at least match the enthusiasm Delhi felt for Kejriwal before he became a more domestic figure. Rajini claims he wants to create a political revolution, the beginning of a spiritual politics. I guess it is his way of saying he wants to initiate an honest politics without invoking a critique of Jaya or DMK. He talks of a politics devoid of caste and religion. I guess what he is looking for is sociology of a new constituency different from the current vote banks that have tied up politics into predictable rhetorical grids. What he is hoping to trigger is a generational change in livelihood and lifestyle, which could redefine society. The script as it stands today sounds empty, or at best, well-intentioned. Rajini does not project the ease of politics. He stands like a star waiting for a cue from the director, desperate for the right plot and the right lines. But the moment, in terms of its timing, has tremendous potential. A new generation wants to rewrite society and Rajini has the stature to lead them. Maybe it is time civil society came to his aide, preparing an ideological programme, and create a new reciprocity between civil society and politics. One is thinking in particular of an attempt to revive the fate of agriculture, marked by epidemics of suicide. What is true of farming is also is also becoming true of fishing. The recent impact of Cyclone Ockhi revealed that the Tamil Nadu politician had no sense of the travails of deep sea fishing. If livelihood politics, human rights and ecology were to combine once more embedded in a theory of culture and the creativity of language, Tamil Nadu can offer a new politics to a Modi embroiled India. I do not think this is the time for cynics or for so-called realists to say that Tamil Nadu politics will continue to see-saw between factions of the Dravidian movement. Rajini has the charisma, and civil society, composed of ecologists, feminists, educationalists, can provide the content for a progressive dream. Like a good actor, Rajini knows how to pick his cues and like a charismatic politician, he can give such ideas a drama, a force which can create a new dream of politics. Society cannot play spectator for long. It has to script the new dream of politics, brushing aside the tiredness and staleness of the old profession politician. It is time for the miracle to happen.

As Maharashtra descended into chaos following the violence orchestrated by rightwing leaders Sambaji Bhide Guruji and Milind Ekbote during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the  , the BJP found itself torn between condemning the rabble-rousers and asserting a pro-Dalit stance to shed the party's label of being an upper-caste party. What seemed easier, obviously, was to keep quiet. In Maharashtra's history of Dalit versus others, two incidents in the past saw a major shift in political dynamics. Back in early 1980s, the Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence when egged on by his \"troubled conscience\" former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar University. After a 16-year-old campaign - Namantar Andolan - Dalits half-succeeded in renaming Aurangabad's Marathawada University to Dr BR Ambedkar Marathwada University. Pawar though was made to pay for his \"altruism\" later as he lost the support of the Maratha community even as Shiv Sena, which strictly opposed the renaming move, further strengthened its base. Pawar, who used to enjoy considerable popularity in the area, could never \"recuperate\" and lost his base among the Marathas. Several attempts to undo the hurt failed as the Namantar Andolan had left the fissures wide open. In another incident which went on to change the political equations in the state, Mumbai police, back in 1997, opened fire upon residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar who were protesting against the desecration of Ambedkar's statue. The police firing claimed as many as 10 lives. The incident led to significant unrest throughout Maharashtra, including rioting and social boycotts against the protesting Dalits.  Although the then Shiv Sena government justified the police action, many couldn't overlook the fact that those in power find it justifiable to use excessive force to muzzle Dalit assertion. This particular incident brought together Dalit groups, including the one led by Prakash Ambedkar and Ramdas Atahawale. The impact of the Ghatkopar incident could be seen in 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Despite riding high on the Ram Mandir issue, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine was brought to its knees by the grand coalition of all republican factions with the Congress and its allies winning 37 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats. Pramod Mahajan too lost his Mumbai North East seat (Ghatkopar East and West Assembly segments fall under Mumbai-North East) due to wide spread anger against the police brutality in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar. The following year in 1999, the Shiv Sena-BJP lost the Assembly elections in Maharshtra. Following the latest spate of violence in Maharashtra, many believe the Bhima-Koregaon episode could prove to be chief minister Davendra Fadnavis' Ramabai Nagar moment.  Even though Fadnavis has been patting the back of his government \"for not letting the violence go out of hand\", the Sena, this time, tore into the BJP government over the violence saying \"the only work left [for the BJP] is to fight elections using the government machinery and the police\". While the BJP doesn't have any prominent Dalit face in Maharashtra, the Bhima Koregaon violence, in all likelihood, will only increase the party's dependence on Union minister Ramdas Athavale, who for years was a staunch opponent of the RSS. The BJP for long has tried to shed its upper-caste label. In 1990s, Parmod Mahajan tried to break the BJP's image of a \"shetji bhatji’ (Baniya-Brahman) party with the help of Gopinath Munde by wooing the OBCs. While Munde became the BJP's OBC face, Dalits still remained far away. Dalits, who form around 11 per cent of the population in Maharshtra, have been a solid social block behind the Congress and Pawar's NCP. After winning the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP tried its best to bring the Dalits into its fold. It was precisely why Athawale - one of the prominent Dalit faces of Maharashtra - was brought to Rajya Sabha and then made a Union minister. Despite that, Dalit support to the BJP remains elusive. With the latest spate of violence, the BJP will find it harder to decide whether to woo the Dalits or to rile the Marathas, who form about 30 per cent of the state's population. ","date":"2018-01-05","tag":"Bhima Koregaon,Hindutva,British Rule,Peshwa","title":"How Bhima Koregaon violence poses a major risk to BJP's Dalit politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-upper-caste-bjp-fadnavis-brahmins-dalits-atrocities-violence-hindutva/story/1/21563.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15336},{"author":"Chandra Kumar Bose","content":"\"Rose early but found Prabha still suffering. A son was born at midday..,\" reads a brief entry in Janakinath Bose's diary dated January 23, 1897. The newborn, the ninth child of Janakinath and Prabhabati Devi, was named Subhas. Janakinath was then practising law in Cuttack, in the state of Orissa. He headed a large extended family.   later recalled in his autobiography,  , he felt \"like a thoroughly insignificant being. My parents awed me to a degree\", in the family. It is now 121 years since the birth of Subhas Chandra Bose, and 73 years since his last known journey out of South East Asia, reportedly to the Soviet Union, in mid-August 1945. On January 23 every year Subhas' birth anniversary is celebrated across India. Speeches extolling Bose's charisma and personality, his unique contributions towards Indian independence continue to be made, and stirring national songs continue to be sung in his honour. On that day, in addition to institutionally sponsored events, spontaneous remembrance ceremonies organised by neighbourhood and citizens' groups also take place. This is a unique feature associated only with   birth anniversary which reflects the depth of people's veneration for him after more than half-a-century of his disappearance. This, in a sense, is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life to liberating India from British colonial rule, and had a vision to make \"Free India\" one of the leading nations in the world. But January 23 will pass and Bose will again be relegated to the pages of history. Though deified by many, his ideology and mission are forgotten. Worse, they are not even known by the younger generations of Indians. From his entry into the Indian political movement in the early 1920s, through his prison years and bouts of serious illnesses, Subhas had developed his thoughts on social, political and economic issues which then formed the basis of his ideology. His famous address as the president of the 51st session of the Indian National Congress at Haripura in 1938 contains the crux of his political and economic thinking and plans. Is it widely known that it was in Haripura that Subhas launched the very first Planning Commission for India? In all his key addresses in India and abroad, in articles published in various journals, Subhas articulated his vision for a free India. In his view, the most important problems to be addressed in independent India were that of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, challenges which have not been met even after 70 years of independence. Together with the celebratory functions, a more fitting tribute to Subhas' memory will be to effectively propagate his vision and ideology, which will in turn promote a better understanding of the history and politics of India, and also inspire the present generation of Indians to shape the country on the basis of the high moral values and principles that Subhas stood for and practised all his life. Subhas' works should be part of school and university curricula. Research institutes, including Netaji Subhas Foundation, Kolkata and London, should actively encourage and support national and international scholars to reassess Subhas' role in the Indian independence movement, and also his contemporary relevance. A deeper study of his works will show that many of his social and economic plans still remain valid. In the current Indian situation where there is a bankruptcy of leadership, ideas, commitment and action, Subhas' message, through his writings, speeches and commentaries may help to resurrect the failing morale of those who are working to bring positive change in this country. Above all,   life-long emphasis on the importance of communal harmony and unity among people, irrespective of birth, caste, creed and religion, has not only remained relevant, it has also gained a sense of urgency. In a world torn by ethnic, tribal, religious and regional conflicts, Bose's unqualified rejection of bigotry of any kind from the very outset of his entry into the Indian political scene, and his repeated call for unity among all Indians, famously reflected in the motto of the Indian National Army - Unity, Faith and Sacrifice, alone can help create a secure foundation of contemporary India. Conscious of the grave danger that communalism posed to a country such as India, where people of many faiths were inextricably mixed together over centuries, Subhas had repeatedly warned against the virus of religious bigotry entering the fabric of politics. In referring to what should be the attitude towards religion and caste, Subhas had declared \"... the government of free India must have an absolutely neutral and impartial attitude toward all religions and leave it to the choice of every individual to profess or follow a particular religious faith\" (The Fundamental Problems of India, address at Tokyo University, November 1944). Subhas' legacy will be better served if he is brought alive through his works. However, there is another reality. During the time of the British Raj, Subhas was treated as enemy No 1 and his book  , banned across the coutry. This is understandable and could have been expected from a colonial power determined to hold on to India and ready to suppress any threat to its rule. It is therefore particularly ironic that after the government of free India took charge, a systematic attempt was made to reduce Subhas merely to a Bengal hero, who though deemed idealistic, was seen as a misled individual, and had made the terrible mistake of discarding Mahatma Gandhi's non violent ways in India's freedom struggle. It is only because Subhas had entered the minds and hearts of the Indian people, and of the peoples of Asia, that all attempts at diminishing his stature and role in Indian and global politics have not fully succeeded. The role of the first government of independent India under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in this process of suppression and distortion cannot be ignored or denied. Historians have noted that Nehru had always perceived Subhas as his main rival, and his own statements bear evidence to that fact. Subhas himself had once written that \"nobody has done more harm to me personally and to our cause in this crisis than Pandit Nehru\" (letter to his nephew Amiya Nath Bose, April 17, 1939). As more evidence begins to emerge, it will be possible to make an objective and proper assessment of the role and personalities of our leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and others. When in August 1945 Subhas disappeared, his beloved elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose was in prison. Sarat and Subhas had shared an extraordinary relationship as brothers. Their close personal and emotional bond was enriched and deepened by their shared social and political ideology and goals. After Sarat was released in September 1945, he immediately resumed his campaign for a free and united India. He also decided to acquire the family's ancestral house on Elgin Road in Calcutta to establish an institution for the study and propagation of Subhas' ideology. In 1946, Sarat inaugurated \"Netaji Bhawan\" at their ancestral house and laid the foundations for a Netaji museum and research centre in the name of his brother, who was by then popularly known as Netaji (our leader). It was Sarat's wish that the Bose house should also be used for public and charitable purposes. The Azad Hind Ambulance Service, which he started, provided much-needed medical and social services in the city, especially during the dark days of communal strife. These were tumultuous times for Bengal and India as a whole. A new alternative was beginning to emerge in Bengal's political firmament. Hope turned to Sarat Bose to carry the torch ahead. He became the undisputed leader of the Congress in West Bengal. He was then elected leader of the Congress in the Central Legislative Assembly and became the leader of the Opposition. Sarat's membership of the interim government was, however, short-lived. He left the interim cabinet and the Congress refusing to agree to the partition of India on communal lines. Within a few years, a greater tragedy was to strike. On February 20, 1950, the very morning Sarat was to make an urgent appeal to the people of the two Bengals to reunite, he suddenly passed away. In an attempt to keep alive Bose's legacy and to give it concrete shape, the close followers of the Bose brothers, supported by Sarat's family, set up Sarat Bose Academy at Netaji Bhawan in 1952. It gathered within its fold eminent historians, lawyers, journalists and other committed voluntary workers. It also attracted interested persons from overseas. The academy launched an ambitious programme to develop Netaji Bhawan as a centre of excellence for research and exchange on both national and international affairs. It also aimed to function as a centre for the promotion of arts, music and languages, while continuing to provide other public services. It was to be the main archive for the works of Sarat and Subhas and for all types of documents and records related to them. The major objective of collecting key documents as well as photos and films on the life and activities of Subhas Chandra Bose began in earnest. Amiya Nath Bose, general secretary of Sarat Bose Academy, who took up his father Sarat's mantle, engaged himself fully in this task. He collected a substantial amount of materials, including primary documents, newspaper clippings, journals, films and other stuff on Netaji's activities both from India and abroad. All of these materials were deposited at the Netaji Museum and archives to be made available \"... to students and scholars for the study of and research about the life and work of Netaji...\" The Sarat Bose Academy began publication of Subhas and Sarat's works, and set up a comprehensive photographic exhibition portraying the life and work of the Bose brothers. By the late 1950s, significant progress had been made in the collection of materials for the Netaji Museum and its archives, and it was concluded that it would be appropriate to create a separate body \"to undertake a systematic study of Netaji's life and mission\". This ultimately led to the creation of the Netaji Research Bureau in 1957 under the chairmanship of well-known journalist Satya Ranjan Bakshi and Sisir Kumar Bose (a son of Sarat Bose) as general secretary. Thus, Netaji Bhawan, with its three main organs - Sarat Bose Academy, Netaji Research Bureau and Azad Hind Ambulance Service - was designed to act as the lead institution to uphold and promote the Bose brothers' legacy, and to work towards realising their cherished goals. However, here again the forces bent upon destroying the legacy went to work. Gradually, the Netaji Research Bureau came under the direct influence of the Nehru dynasty dominated central government. The Sarat Bose Academy moved out of Netaji Bhawan. Netaji Research Bureau became the only organ to remain under the directorship of Sisir Bose. Since its inception until now, over a period of 61 years, the Netaji Research Bureau has accomplished one of its basic goals and has published in 12 volumes, almost all of the writings, speeches and letters of Subhas, the bulk of which was originally collected under the auspices of Sarat Bose Academy. The Netaji Research Bureau has reportedly obtained substantial funding from the central government. But judged against its own objectives, and what was envisaged by its founders, the work of Netaji Research Bureau may be said to have been limited. Netaji's own works are not widely available, and conditions to access the archives at Netaji Bhawan are obscure. Was there a price to pay for support from those who have an interest in keeping the Bose brother's legacy in check? In view of the current realities of India today, those who believe in Subhas' ideology and its relevance in contemporary India, must take the initiative to revive, disseminate and act on the basis of that ideology. Such initiatives are already being taken by certain civil society and media groups both in India and abroad. A website is being launched by The Bose Legacy - www.theboselegacy.com - which will be an online archive for all of Subhas' works, a data base of bibliographies and scholars. It will also contain photographs and audio-visual material. The overall objective is to provide access to relevant materials to all those who wish to study the life, activities and ideology of Subhas, and also to those who wish to define their actions in terms of Bose's vision of India and the world.

From small mandals (groups) to chowks, almost everything is named after Hindutva icons. No wonder the controversial Sambhaji Bhide chose this place as his Karma bhoomi. On reaching Sangli on December 4, we saw a huge procession in support of Bhide, who is fondly called as Bhide Guruji by his followers. The 85-year-old founder of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is accused of orchestrating the violence at the   of the battle fought 200 years ago in Bhima Koregaon. As we headed towards his house in Gaonbhag area, we were told that Guruji does not carry a cellphone (or \"bhraman dhwani\" as he calls it). So once he picks up his bicycle and leaves, no one knows his whereabouts. The Datta Niwas building is situated in a narrow bylane of the old town. A police van was parked outside the lane, even though Bhide has not been provided any security cover. As we neared his house, it seemed almost everyone knew the way to his first-floor abode. However, much to our disappointment, we found ourselves staring at a lock on the door. We left a small note at the doorstep. Not too many people know about the staunch Hindutva ideologue, especially outside Maharashtra, but for those who have closely followed the state's identity politics, Bhide Guruji is a familiar name. An ardent follower of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, many say, Bhide's real name is Manohar but he calls himself Sambhaji after the Maratha king. Maratha organisations like Sambhaji Brigade or Maratha Mahasangh allege that Bhide, who is an upper caste Brahmin, deliberately professes Maratha history in a Brahminical perspective. Guruji has a sizeable following in western Maharashtra, particularly in Sangli district, and parts of neighbouring Karnataka. The man with a magnum moustache is usually dressed in a white kurta pajama or dhoti, but never wears a footwear - no matter where he goes. His followers say that Bhide is an MSc in nuclear physics from Pune University and has also served as a professor in Pune's Fergusson College long ago. In Sangli, Bhide is often seen riding a bicycle. He delivers sermons on Shivaji and Sambhaji, most of which are focused on the warrior kings as Hindutva icons. In 2009, he found himself embroiled in a controversy when communal violence broke out in the twin cities of Miraj-Sangli in Sangli district during Ganpati visarjan over an arch, sporting a poster that depicted the slaying of Afzhal Khan - the most capable commander of Ali Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate - at the hands of Chhatrapati Shivaji. It was reportedly erected just a day before Ganesh visarjan. Even though many demanded his arrest, Bhide came out \"victorious\" without a single scratch. The man is known for his fiery talks on the lives of Shivaji Maharaj heavily laced with hatred for Muslims. And until the recent Bhima Koregaon violence, which Bhide is accused of inciting along with Milind Ekbote, he was not known to be anti-Dalit. Bhide's Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is mainly known for training youths in physical education. Every year during Navratri, Bhide organises a marathon called \"Durga Daud\". Many prominent politicians in the past have graced the event. Not widely known outside Maharashtra, Bhide made national headlines in 2014 when Prime Minister  , during a 2014 Assembly election rally in Sangli, reportedly referred to the hardcore Hindutva activist as one of his inspirations. \"Bhide Guruji did not invite me here. I came here on his orders,” Modi had said during the rally,\" Modi had said. Those close to Bhide say the once-RSS pracharak split from the Sangh Parivar following difference of opinion with former RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras. Ever since then he has been busy running the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, albeit on the lines of the RSS. Much like the practice in RSS shakhas, we came to know, Bhide and his followers gather at their office every morning for workout sessions. We decided to catch up with him there. On a cold Friday morning, our team reached the Vishnu Ghat on the banks of river Krishna. A group of men had already begun their \"surya namaskar\" amid chanting of mantras. We were told that Bhide usually reaches by 5am. We kept waiting on the stairs of a temple watching another group of senior citizens practising laughter yoga. A while later, Bhide came riding his old bicycle. After greeting us, the first thing he asked us to do was to put aside our cameras. He then asked us to join us in his morning prayers and introduced us to others as \"guests of Sangli from Mumbai\". The prayers started with \"Jayatu Hindu Rashtram (long Iive the Hindu nation)\". While the prayers, offered to goddess Bhawani, praised Shivaji and Sambhaji, it was difficult to miss the religious undertones. After the prayers, the group got ready for another round of surya namaskar. Bhide, we were told, has added two additional surya mantras to the usual cycle in the name of Shivaji and Sambhaji. After we joined him in his workout and prayers, the man seemed comfortable talking to us. As soon as he is asked about the Bhima Koregaon violence, he vehemently claimed innocence and said it was a political conspiracy. He even appealed for a thorough inquiry into the incident. Giving examples from Mahabharata, he told us that even \"lord Krishna had to face allegations of theft\". As he got up to leave on his cycle cutting through a line of followers who had gathered to meet him, it was clear Bhide's no ordinary man.","date":"2018-01-05","tag":"Hindutva,Dalit atrocities,Bhima Koregaon,Sambhaji Bhide","title":"On meeting Bhima Koregaon violence accused Sambhaji Bhide","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sambhaji-bhide-sangli-house-bhima-koregaon-dalit-atrocities-bhide-guruji-violence-hindutva/story/1/21569.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15338},{"author":"Sourish Bhattacharyya","content":"The manufactured outrage over the annual Dalit-led celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the  , unless seen through the pseudo-nationalist lenses, is yet another aggressive Hindutva attempt to muzzle the new Dalit voices that are becoming louder after the marginalisation of the likes of Mayawati and Ramdas Athawale. It is an expression of the venomous bigotry that drives the ill-informed Hindutva narrative - the very same bigotry that sparked off the Karni Sena anger against  , a film purportedly (I use the word deliberately because no one has seen it, apart from Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, outside the CBFC) based on an allegorical Sufi poem written in 1540 CE by a Muslim, Malik Muhammad Jayasi, about a fictional princess from Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka; note, she wasn't a Rajput), who becomes the queen of Chittor, and Allauddin Khilji falls in love with her. Understandably, the country has gone into election mode, and Hindutva loyalists have little to brag about after three and half years in power, except an economy where the fiscal deficit has spiralled out of control, jobs are hard to find, the farming sector is wracked by crises and prices of essential commodities showing no signs of abatement, even as Pakistan continues to kill and maim our braveheart soldiers in cold blood. There's only one way to deflect national attention away from the paralysis of equitable development that has set in. And the cynical strategy is to   to polarise voters - Hindus against Muslims and Christians, and the upper castes against Dalits. It started with the so-called \"love jihad\" and the alleged cow smugglers, but the virus, post-Gujarat Assembly elections, has infected the national discourse. Branding Rahul Gandhi as being anti-triple talaq bill when all his party, along with 17 others, has asked for is a parliamentary select committee review of one provision of the bill, is the latest expression of this nation-corroding argument. Questioning the legitimacy of Jignesh Mevani joining the annual celebrations of the Battle of Koregaon - the victory of a unit of the East India Company (comprising 900 Mahar soldiers) over the Peshwa Bajirao II's army in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, a commemoration whose history goes back to January 1, 1927, when BR Ambedkar started the tradition as an assertion of Dalit opposition to upper caste oppression, which had been institutionalised by the Brahminical Peshwas - is a strand of the same divisive narrative. Any Indian citizen can legitimately join a celebration, even it has political overtones, in any part of the country. If a Bhojpuri film star can represent North East Delhi and become the president of the BJP's Delhi unit, how can Jigesh Mevani be questioned for emerging as yet another national voice of the Dalits? Only those with a Peshwa mindset will parrot (reminds me of Padmavati's parrot in Jayasi's poem) such arguments, including the one linking Mevani with Umar Khalid, who, like any other Indian citizen, has the right to engage in a political or any other activity in any part of the country. This argument is as destructive as the mischievous misrepresentation of the acronym HAJ (Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh) formed with the first letters of the names of the three youth leaders who turned the political tide in Gujarat during the recent elections. Politics aside, let's turn to facts to make sense of the mayhem that just shook Maharashtra: 1) It was Chhatrapati Shivaji, who's much loved by the Hindutva army, who inducted Mahars into his army as scouts and guards of forts. 2) The tradition was discontinued by the Peshwas, who heaped inhuman insults upon the Mahars, like insisting that they have a broom tied to their back (to clear their footprints) and hang an earthen pitcher from their necks to prevent their shadow from \"polluting\" the streets. The celebration of the East India Company's victory in the Battle of Koregaon is not a homage paid to a colonial army, but an assertion of Dalit power against Brahminical oppression. 3) If the celebration of the Battle of Koregaon tantamounts to paying homage to colonialism, then the BJP, too, stands guilty of the same charge because of its opposition in Karnataka to Tipu Sultan, who fought the East India Company till his last dying moment. 4) After the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when British colonial generals, led by Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, floated the myth of the martial races, the Mahars were edged out of the British Indian Army and eventually the regiment bearing the name of the caste was disbanded in 1895. For the Mahars, the army provided an escape from their dehumanised life in a caste-oppressed society, which was why they kept demanding that their regiment be reinstated - a demand that was supported by Mahatma Gandhi's political guru, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and later, the Indian National Congress even though it was opposed to the army recruitment policies of the British Raj. 5) It was the British Indian Army that provided a caste-free upbringing to BR Ambedkar, whose father, Subedar Ramji Sakpal, was a teacher in the Mahar Regiment school at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. That may have been the reason why Ambedkar, as member of the viceroy's Defence Advisory Committee in 1941, made a strong pitch for the revival of the Mahar Regiment. 6) The viceroy accepted Ambedkar's plea and the first battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum in October 1941. In the years that followed until Independence, the regiment expanded steadily, saw action in Burma and Iraq, was among the first to become a machine gun regiment in 1946 (it was then that the Koregaon Victory Pillar, the scene of the January 1 celebrations, was replaced by two crossed Vickers machine guns on the regimental crest), and provided security to refugees during the Partition bloodbath. Post-Independence, it became a more integrative unit with the induction of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujaratis who were rejected as non-martial by the British. The Mahars today are 21 battalions strong and have produced two distinguished Army chiefs, General KV Krishna Rao and General K Sundarji. Most importantly, the regiment has given the community back the self-pride that the Peshwas had snuffed out. Hindutva bullies who don't want the Dalits to celebrate their moment of freedom are pursuing cynical electoral manoeuvres that can only lead to one loss - the inclusive idea of India that had been so caringly seeded by Jawaharlal Nehru and nurtured by all those who practise the politics of inclusion.","date":"2018-01-04","tag":"RSS,Hindutva,Dalits,Bhima Koregaon","title":"Attack on Dalits celebrating the 200th anniversary of Battle of Koregaon is a forewarning on what's to come","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-dalits-hindutva-maharashtra-bandh-rss-jignesh-mevani-umar-khalid/story/1/21544.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15339},{"author":"Rajeev Sharma","content":"The real intentions of Pakistan behind the Christmas Day meeting between Kulbhushan Jadhav and his wife and mother - with a glass partition in between - have been exposed by Maulana Ameer Hamza, one of the founders of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). That the entire event was stage-managed by Pakistan to score brownie-points against India was revealed by Maulana Ameer Hamza at a public rally last week in Rawalpindi when he  : \"ISI and Pakistan government humiliated Jadhav's family during their visit to Islamabad. They also made Jadhav face his family across a glass wall… India had requested Pakistan to allow Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet him. Pakistan showed mercy and invited them. India thought that they would meet Jadhav face-to-face on a sofa, but the ISI didn’t allow it.” Hamza's boastful remarks indicate the following: 1) The meeting between Jadhav and his wife and mother was a charade, meant to humiliate the Jadhav family and send a wry message to India; 2) The existence of a nefarious nexus between the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistan government and how the ISI choreographed the entire event though preparations for the meeting were largely between the foreign offices of the two countries; 3) The camaraderie between terror outfits and the Pakistani military establishment as Maulana Ameer Hamza was speaking at a public rally which couldn’t have taken place without the ISI's prior approval and the fact that he sought to lionise the ISI at the Rawalpindi rally. Does it not sound weird that the leader of a notorious terror outfit praises the host country’s premier intelligence agency? Such a scenario would have been shameful for any civilised nation, but in Pakistan it is a routine. It’s not for nothing that Pakistan is repeatedly hauled over the coals by the international community over terrorism, the latest in this never-ending series being extremely tough remarks against Pakistan by US President Donald Trump. Pakistan took the extreme measure of allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav to meet his mother and wife knowing that they needed to pre-empt any strictures being passed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On September 13, India submitted its written pleadings to the ICJ. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, while responding to a question regarding the development, had stated that \"India has…submitted its memorial (written pleadings) to the ICJ in the Jadhav case involving egregious violation of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 by Pakistan. This is in furtherance of our application filed before the Court on May 8, 2017\". Earlier in May 2017, the ICJ had stayed Jadhav’s execution by Pakistan and had asked both parties to submit their written pleadings by September 13, 2017. Pakistani commentator Ejaz Haider had recently commented in an  : \"That Jadhav is important for India is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by New Delhi approaching the ICJ.\" One could counter that by saying thus: “That Jadhav is important to Pakistan is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by Pakistan constantly using him as a tool to pick on India sponsoring terrorism in Balochistan.”  The reality is that Pakistan got Jadhav on a platter and is using him to the hilt. It needs to be recalled that Jadhav was kidnapped in Iran and delivered to Pakistan by a faction of the Taliban working for Iran. The Taliban sold him to the Pakistanis for a price. And thereby hangs the tale. Pakistan first announced that they would accede to the Indian request to let Jadhav’s family meet him in Pakistan and promptly provided visas for the same on December 20, 2017. However, it is noteworthy that Pakistan did not grant consular access to any authorised personnel of the Indian Mission in Islamabad prior to the meeting, but instead only permitted the family to meet Jadhav. The meeting on December 25 was more of a charade than a meeting on humanitarian grounds. Importantly, the family was not allowed to converse in Marathi with Jadhav, to ensure that the Pakistanis could understand what exchange took place between the prisoner and his family. The family’s meeting with Jadhav, according to their own version, showed that Jadhav was under stress and spoke under coercion. Pakistan subsequently claimed that the procedure followed for the meeting, including asking the mother and wife to change their attire, had been agreed to by both countries in advance, a fact which India has firmly denied. Earlier in September last year, Pakistan's foreign minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, let out a canard that there was a   for a swap between Jadhav and a Pakistani who was involved in the Peshawar Army Public School attack and was said to be in Afghan custody. Asif claimed that India’s NSA Ajit Doval had told him that India could exchange that terrorist with the \"terrorist\" Pakistan had, namely Jadhav. Asif made these remarks while speaking at the Asia Society in New York, but the idea was quickly shot down by both India and Afghanistan. The issue of a swap may well have been discussed at some stage, but there appears to be no reason why Afghanistan should give their acquiescence to an Indian request to let off a known Afghan terrorist in their custody. Furthermore, if one goes back to reports of the terrorist strike at the APS Peshawar, there were six terrorists involved in the attack - one Chechen, two Afghans and three Arabs. In the rescue operation carried out by Pakistani Special Services Group, all six terrorists were killed. So who is this special guy the Afghans were holding on to as Asif claimed in September 2017? The mastermind of the Peshawar attack Omar Khorasani, was killed in a drone strike in October 2017. So much for Pakistan's claims of being the honest dealer and allowing India to meet with the family of commander Kulbhushan Jadhav. By the way, Jadhav is not a serving Indian Navy officer and had, in fact, retired in 2001. He had been working independently in Chahbahar Port in Iran since 2003. At the time of his arrest in March 2016, the Pakistani establishment planted a fake passport on him in the name of Hussein Mubarak Patel and claimed that he was a spy who had worked for India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) since 2013. The Pakistani narrative has always held that he is an active naval officer, a claim that appears false because of two things. First, India would not send a serving naval officer as an undercover agent to Iran. Second, if the officer was serving and had been posted to Chahbahar in uniform he would have diplomatic cover. Meanwhile, on December 25 last year, Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani (a Shia country that the Sunni Pakistan is frantically trying to become close to), while addressing a news conference in Islamabad after attending a six-nation anti-terror conference in Islamabad, said: “Kulbhushan was doing business in Chahbahar and we had no information about him being a spy. The security institutions of both countries (Pakistan and Iran) had already exchanged information in this regard.” It is time for India to call Pakistan’s bluff and continue to work with the international community and increase pressure through the ICJ to get consular access to Jadhav. India must make all efforts to ensure that Jadhav is brought back to India alive. That would be a fitting honour for a former naval officer and an Indian national who deserves better than being a pawn in Pakistani hands.","date":"2018-01-03","tag":"ISI,LeT,Pakistan,Kulbhushan Jadhav","title":"How ISI choreographed Kulbhushan Jadhav's meeting with family to humiliate India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kulbhushan-jadhav-wife-mother-meeting-mea-pakistan-let-isi/story/1/21526.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15340},{"author":"Romita Datta","content":"She had once called her \"Ma/Jangalmahal er Ma\" (mother, mother of Jangal Mahal). And the mother very often would tell others what a good girl she was. Often this mutual admiration would be on the dais of political rallies and government programmes in full public view. This was in 2011 and it continued for seven years as the mother's \"bhalo meye\" - or the good girl - obediently and with the right dosage of obeisance was toeing her line, fulfilling all her wishes and definitely becoming indispensable to her. The daughter in question is Bharati Ghosh, former SP of West Midnapore, and the mother is none other than Mamata Banerjee. Bharati, who was part of a UN peacekeeping mission for years and a former management student of Harvard, came to Bengal in 2011 and drew Mamata's attention after the latter took over as the chief minister of the state. From the state CID, she was made the SP of West Midnapore, which witnessed Maoist violence after 2008. Bharati, with her vast experience in war-torn places of Kosovo and Bosnia, was thought fit to tackle the Maoists. Like an efficient cop, she decimated the Maoists and was responsible for the death of their leader, Koteswar Rao, in a severe gun-battle. The other prominent Maoists operating in that area, and responsible for death of jawans in police camps, were wooed over with handsome packages, and the young turks who dreamt of a classless revolution were won over in the fold of the ruling party with posts, power and privileges. The backward areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore became free of not just the Maoist menace but of any dissenting voices. The districts surrendered and Mamata compensated with heavy doses of development, plugging all possibilities of a Maoist regrouping. And all this was largely possible because of Bharati Ghosh, who dared to be deadly different. Gradually, Bharati gained Mamata's confidence and according to the Opposition, she was less of a police officer and more of a party functionary. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in the 2016 Assembly polls, Bharati  . She was transferred by the EC from the SP's post for allegedly intimidating poll officers and overstepping her jurisdiction. In 2016, she was reprimanded for exceeding her brief and meeting political persons, especially Mukul Roy, then second-in-command of the Trinamool Congress, while model code of conduct was in place. The rap from the EC had no effect on Bharati as Mamata awarded her with prized posting, more power and punch, and greater responsibility. As Bharati went on antagonising Mamata's enemies, she scored brownie points in her career, obviously gaining in the confidence of the chief minister. But finally what soured the relation was Mukul Roy leaving the Trinamool Congress and joining the BJP. Bharati, known to be close and loyal to Roy, became a prime suspect in the eyes of the chief minister. As Roy started consolidating the base of the BJP in the Jungle Mahal area, there were rumours that Bharati was using her clout and muscle power to help him make deep inroads. The final nail in the coffin was the result of the by-election in Sabang in West Midnapore district. Though the Trinamool Congress won with a huge margin of over 67,000 votes and BJP came third, the latter increased its vote share by 17 per cent and that was enough to keep tongues wagging. The Congress-turned-Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Manas Bhuniya, who hailed from Sabang and was a strong critique of Bharati Ghosh since the time he was in the Opposition as a Congress MLA, saw this as an opportunity to turn Mamata against her \"good girl\". There were allegations from the district intelligence office that Bharati had held meetings with BJP leaders and was helping them improve their vote share. Logically, Bharati stood to gain by siding with the BJP. Mamata also had a hunch that Bharati would prefer to work for the party at the Centre given her ambition and career prospects. Immediately after the Sabang by-election results came out, Bharati was removed to an insignificant post as an officer of State Armed Police in Barrackpore. But Bharati   to the DG of police. While the resignation will help her think clearly on what should be the next step, it will also free her of her commitments to the service rules. She is threatening to open her mouth and settle scores. To swallow her resignation would mean handing over an ammo to BJP, since Bharati by virtue of being close to the ruling Trinamool Congress shared many secrets, especially the ones that the \"mother-daughter\" duo exchanged. Mamata has initiated an internal investigation against Bharati Ghosh to ensure she keeps mum, but given the stubborn daughter she is, Bharati might not buckle. Taking up the challenge of a duel, Bharati has also retorted saying that she too has a tale to tell.

The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a \"Bahujan\" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of \"Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak\" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and \"Gau-Brahman prati palak\" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as \"Rayate cha Raja\" (king of the ryots). \r\n \r\n Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ","date":"2018-01-02","tag":"Devendra Fadnavis,BJP,Dalits,Maharashtra","title":"How Bhima Koregaon battle anniversary turned into a riot","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-protests-dalits-killed-maharashtra-bjp-devendra-fadnavis-caste-politics/story/1/21500.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15342},{"author":"Aninda Dey","content":"Donald Trump may have forced   to cringe in his grave. The swashbuckling, swaggering playboy-US Congressman from Texas and   were brothers in arms literally - Pakistan was the conduit for channelling Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who finally started shooting down the lethal, much-feared Soviet Hind copters (Mi-24s) - or \"Shaitan-Arba\" (Satan’s Chariot) - with pinpoint accuracy in Afghanistan. As more planeloads of Stingers and other weapons landed in Pakistan, Wilson and Zia bonded closer. “Yes, Charlie did it,” remarked Zia after the Soviets met their Waterloo and made an ignominious exit. While Wilson loved Pakistan, he hated India. His hatred was evident when he dubbed India hypocritical and a satellite of the erstwhile Soviet Union in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003. “My general experience of Indians is that they are rather arrogant, know a lot more than anyone else about most things and are stiff-necked. Just like the Americans. But I noticed that they changed very quickly once the Soviets collapsed.” However, the Faustian pact the US had struck with the dreaded Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to counter the Soviets continued as Zia bled J&K under Operation Topaz with Uncle Sam turning a blind eye. The devilish deal would come back to haunt the US with Wilson’s rampaging \"Frankenstein\" in Afghanistan transforming itself into Godzilla - the very Mujahideen mutated into the Taliban and the ISI, under its rugged and foxy director Hamid Gul, nurtured the Taliban with Saudi money.   Washington continued to nurture the relationship with Pakistan and billions of dollars in aid flowed into the country. From 2002 to 2016, the US has provided more than $14 billion in aid to Pakistan with the highest assistance of $2,100 million in 2011 - the same year in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hunted down by the Navy Seal Team Six in a house close to Pakistan’s military academy in Abbottabad. The Afghan abyss still stares at the US. Trump blocking $255-million in military aid to Pakistan is perhaps the biggest jolt for Islamabad after Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad. Despite billions of dollars of aid, Pakistan and the ISI has been helping the Taliban, the Haqqani network, LeT and JeM. With the Islamic State (IS) entering Afghanistan, America faces a two-headed snake. Although the US has not given the specific reason for the aid blockade, Trump’s Afghanistan policy - which targeted Pakistan for not doing enough to rein in terrorists - and the threat from the IS and the LeT seem to have prompted the president.      As the IS is rapidly losing ground in Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan could be its next bastion. The threat of IS plotting attacks on the US in Afghanistan looms large. According to the New America Foundation, there have been several IS-inspired attacks on US soil. The IS had claimed responsibility for the attack on an exhibition of Prophet Muhammad cartoons in Garland, Texas, in 2015. In the first IS-inspired attack on US, the two attackers had been in touch with an online recruiter for the terror outfit. In the latest IS-inspired attack in October 2017, Uzbek   Sayfullo Saipov rammed a rented truck into pedestrians and cyclists near the World Trade Center, killing eight. In the worst terrorist attack since 9/11, the IS claimed responsibility for the Orlando gay nightclub attack in which   shot dead 50 people. Although the LeT primarily focusses on India, it poses threat to the US as well. Times Square bomber   was trained by the LeT in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Way back in 2013, Jonah Blank, senior political scientists at RAND Corporation, had raised the possibility of a 26/11-like attack in the US. She told the Committee on Homeland Security, “A Mumbai-style attack - that is, an attack dramatic and shocking enough to inspire widespread terror even without the use of weapons of mass destruction or a casualty-count in the thousands - remains a realistic near-term threat to the homeland. Such an attack might be termed, \"Boston Squared\" - that is, an attack similar to the   in April, but much larger in effect.” Stressing the LeT’s capability, experience and resourcefulness, Blank said the terror outfit had “enjoyed virtually open support from the Pakistani state throughout the 1990s, and has received at least tacit protection from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate since the group was officially banned by Islamabad in 2002”. Top al Qaeda commander Abu Zubaydah was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 2002, in an LeT safe house. “Lashkar-e Taiba is a de facto affiliate of al Qaeda, and is believed to have joined Osama bin Laden's International Islamic Front for jihad sometime after the umbrella group's famous fatwa in 1998,” Blank added. Trump is riled by the continued ISI support to the Taliban and the Haqqani network, which has been frustrating US efforts to come out of the Afghan imbroglio. After more than 15 years and thousands of casualties, the US has failed to beat the battle-hardened Taliban, which now hold sway over 60 per cent of Afghanistan. ","date":"2018-01-02","tag":"Charlie Wilson,Zia-ul-haq,Pakistan,Donald Trump","title":"Trump blocking $255-mn aid is perhaps the biggest jolt to Pakistan after Abbottabad raid","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/trump-pakistan-zia-charlie-wilson-osama-bin-laden-abbottabad-isi/story/1/21507.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15343},{"author":"Anand Balasubramanian","content":"Actor Rajinikanth has launched a  as a quick follow-up to his big announcement of entering politics on December 31, 2017.  Leaving aside the fact that the website is as basic as it comes and looks cluttered, how far will this be helpful in taking his political career forward with the recruitment of new members is the real question. \r\n \r\n Online recruitment is not new in Indian politics. The Congress has an online membership form through which you can become a member of the party without visiting any of its offices. All you need is a copy of your voter ID card. The BJP takes this a step further and gives you an option between becoming a member and online aficionado of the party with portal user-only access. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK and the DMK too allow online enrolment into the party. When it comes to reaching out to their followers, almost all big names have mobile apps. Even new entrants who are yet to launch their parties such as actors Kamal Haasan and Vishal have launched their own apps to connect with the people. While these apps and website will definitely be useful, will it really be a key player in inviting new members into the party? Well, yes. It will attract the current generation who are perpetually glued to their phone screens to join the party or their cause. The only issue is, how to convert these members into actual votes. When one had to visit an office, fill out a form and pay a membership fee, the person joining the party would have to have the intention and the will to join for him to put in that effort. If you belong to the left-wing political parties, you are expected to share a portion of your monthly purse with the party. You will be forced to make a conscious decision of following the ideology of the party and going out of your way before joining it. Even though this is not foolproof, it will at the very least ensure that the person who joins your party has the will to vote for you at the time of contributing to your vote share in the constituency.   When all you have to do is fill up four to five fields in an online form to join a party, you will not only attract the “why not” crowd, but also the mischievous, if not malicious elements. This could lead to embarrassing situations in the future since the party leadership would be answerable for their actions. It would also end up inflating the party numbers and giving false hope to the party leadership. Another question that the party needs to ask itself is if the numbers generated from online membership actually translate into votes in its favour. But make no mistake about it, apps and websites are absolutely essential in today’s age. It will help the party and the leader keep his cadre engaged. Providing an app to existing party members where they would need their party ID to login would help them keep their base consolidated. It will also keep them apprised of the party’s current stand on important issues, rally them for protests and even help them provide effective feedback to the party leadership on the local issues. However, the effectiveness of online recruitment of party members is something that is untested and may prove to be ineffective for a start-up party. If Rajinikanth plans to convert these members directly into party cadre en masse, he would have to be wary of the pitfalls that would ensue with the strategy. For, people who probably do not want to see Rajinikanth in politics, can use the website/app to infiltrate into the party and corrupt his base and image altogether. That is one danger the existing parties with consolidated base which use the app or website for communication is safe from.  ","date":"2018-01-02","tag":"Website,Mobile app,Politics,Rajinikanth","title":"Should Rajinikanth's digital drive worry his political opponents?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-political-party-online-recruitment-android-mobile-app-website/story/1/21509.html","website":"dailyo","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15344},{"author":"Manoj Joshi","content":"When it comes to the Modi government’s foreign policy record, you can see it as a glass half full or a glass half empty. Full or empty, it was half. It did not meet its full potential and there were more misses than hits, especially in the neighbourhood, in 2017. But there was one significant achievement which has made up for this and has important portents for the future. This was facing down Beijing over Doklam which was done with verve and sophistication. So what could 2018 bring? Perhaps its most important motif will be balance. Having stepped out in significant directions in 2015 and 2016 towards the US and Israel, Modi will seek to restore some equilibrium. He will seek to repair ties with China and reach out to Palestine, to signal to the Arab world that Indian policy is not changing. Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanhayu is to visit India in mid-January for the Raisina Dialogue, but that is more about ideological signaling rather than achieving any major foreign policy goal. India is not a player in the Middle East, its primary interest is the stability of this vital region and it would be well advised to maintain its traditional posture of balancing between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the Saudi-Israel entente growing, there could be an argument for a slight tilt in the Iranian direction, else we may see a repeat of a situation where external pressures pushed our ally Russia into the arms of China. Note that Modi’s initiatives in the Gulf sheikhdoms are now paying. Following Modi’s visit in early 2017, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested nearly $3 billion (Rs 19,000 crore)in a range of areas relating to infrastructure and renewable energy. And this, say Indian diplomats in the region, is only the beginning. In 2018, significant developments could also take place in southeast Asia, beginning with the Indo-ASEAN commemorative summit on January, followed by New Delhi hosting all the ASEAN leaders collectively as chief guests at the Republic Day function. Modi’s expected speech at the Shangrila Dialogue in Singapore in early June will be important because it is being delivered at Asia’s premier security meet. This could be a harbinger of deepening Indian commitments in the region to balance China’s activism in South Asia. Having faced down Beijing in Doklam, India is in a good position to engage Beijing. Not much will come from this because issues between the two are not open to quick resolution. In recent years, they have displayed a dangerous tendency not to respond to the numerous CBMs that have kept peace between the two countries in recent decades. We now need newer mechanisms simply to ensure things do not get out of hand. If things go well, we could well see an acceleration of the steadily increasing Chinese investments in India topped off by a visit by Chinese supremo, Xi Jinping. The Chinese understand well that India is a huge opportunity for them. We could well see a negotiated settlement of the Sino-Indian impasse over the Belt and Road Initiative. It is in the context of China that India also needs to pay attention to Russia in 2018. There has been significant activity on the official front in 2017, but a visit by President Putin for the annual consultative summit could restore some vitality to the relationship. Our most important tie will remain the one with the US. It will also be the most problematic. It has so far been Washington’s best managed foreign relationship, but it could rub up against Indian interests relating to Iran and Russia. However, there is every indication that the US is willing to give New Delhi considerable leeway here because its need for India’s weight in the “Indo Pacific” region is significant. And what about Pakistan? There is unlikely to be much of a shift here, considering Pakistan has no real government at present and, perhaps, more important, it remains a useful electoral tool for Modi. He is also likely to visit Davos for the World Economic Forum summit. At first sight, it looks like an attempt to catch up with Jinping who was the chief guest last year. Symbolic attendance at Davos won’t change things. The economy is not going anywhere for a while and Modi must take the blame for that. New Delhi does appear to be in a sweet spot of sorts because of American friction with Pakistan and China. This could grow, for differing reasons, in 2018. This can provide sufficient space to further India’s interests. This is where the rub comes in. It is now widely accepted that Indian economy slowed down on account of self-inflicted wounds in 2017. Hopefully, Modi and his team will not do a repeat in the arena of foreign policy.

lawmaker from Hawaii in the US Congress, is considering a run for American presidency in 2020, according to sources close to her. On Friday, 9 November, at a Medtronic conference in Los Angeles, eminent Indian-American Dr Sampat Shivangi introduced Gabbard, 37, and said that she could be the next president of the US in 2020. The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didn’t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didn’t deny it either. Tulsi Gabbard is an American politician of the Democratic Party serving as the US Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district since 2013. Gabbard, who represents a constituency in Hawaii, is not of Indian descent and neither of her parents are Hindu, but she practises Hinduism. Gabbard was born in 1981 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children born to Carol and Mike Gabbard, a State Senator. In 2002, Gabbard became the youngest person ever to be elected to the Hawaii State Legislative, and in 2012, she was elected to the US House. She went on to win the general election by nearly 80 points. She is one of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, and she was deployed with the Hawaii National Guard to Iraq in 2005 and Kuwait in 2009. According to a report in , Gabbard became one of the most popular political figures after she broke with the Democratic Party establishment and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016, even resigning as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to be able to do so. In 2004, Gabbard volunteered to join the 29 Brigade of US soldiers when they were called to war in Iraq. According to Gabbard’s website, “She (Gabbard) felt it was more important to stand in solidarity with her fellow soldiers than to climb the political ladder.” However, Gabbard’s critics have questioned her views on foreign policy and her tolerance of dictators like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard came under attack after she met Assad in 2017. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Trapper, she said that she hadn’t planned on meeting him but when the opportunity arose, she did, because she felt it was important. Democratic leaders maintained silence on one of their leaders meeting a head of state who has been dubbed a war criminal by the US. Then, in April 2017, Gabbard’s stand on the chemical attack in Syria raised eyebrows again. According to an article in  , in 2015, Gabbard was among the Democrats who voted for restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She had also expressed “skepticism” about the widely held assertion that Assad’s government was behind chemical attacks in Syria. After the 2002 Gujarat riots, the US government had denied a visa to Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Gabbard was one of the few to criticise the US government’s decision. According to an article in  , five months after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India, Gabbard opposed a resolution which called for “religious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials,” saying that it would weaken India-US relations. In August 2014, Gabbard made it a point to meet Modi in New York after his Madison Square Garden speech and presented him a copy of the  that she swore by when she was elected. Before that, in August 2014, speaking at a fundraising event for the BJP in Georgia, US, Gabbard had hailed Modi’s 2014 landslide victory and said, “People (of India) stood up, one by one by one by one, and said ‘we will demand that this change occurs’.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

His charismatic personality electrified audiences, and his organisational skills were unmatched. His influence on other freedom fighters – from Yogi Aurobindo to Netaji Subhas C Bose – is just as incomparable. It was not only fellow Indians who came under Vivekananda’s spell. He was arguably the first and most successful brand ambassador of a resurgent India in the USA, spreading his teaching far and wide. Vivekananda strove to combat superstition, to get rid of the deadwood of ritual that was  stifling those who followed the Hindu way of life, and left behind a large body of written work, reinterpreting the Vedanta for modern times. Vivekananda’s ways were unorthodox. The cigar-smoking monk had no problem with those who ate meat. He freely borrowed from whatever he felt was the best practice in other religions. His favourite word was ‘strength’ – he exhorted fellow Indians to be strong in body and spirit. He was compassionate and liberal in his outlook. For him, there was no religion greater than serving the wretched – the poor, the ailing, and the oppressed. The ochre robes of a Hindu monk have become a red rag for these scholars who bore the heavy  . Vivekananda became a symbol of what was termed   strident and aggressive. They failed to see that Vivekananda continued to mesmerise the young and old across the length and breadth of India, long after his death. Calendar art bears testimony to this – the undisputed Trimurti of Swami Vivekananda, Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhash Bose continue to adorn the walls of many homes even today. Those who are agitated today about the appropriation of Vivekananda by the Sangh Parivar and are desperate to reclaim him, must ask themselves this question – why and how had they remained blind to the multifaceted contributions of this exceptional Indian? Today the Congress and other parties in opposition are desperately trying to get a foothold in the hearts and minds of voters who proudly proclaim their adherence to ‘Sanatana Dharma’. Simultaneously, strategists are working overtime on how best to market ‘Soft Hinduism’ to counter the machinations of the Hindutva Brigade. In the short term, this opportunism may bring some dividends, but it is bound to eventually boomerang. The  believed in service before self, and couldn’t stand hypocrisy. He examined the past with ruthless detachment and tested everything with razor-sharp intelligence. He was indeed a pioneering moderniser. At the same time, one can not surgically separate the social reformer from the spiritual seeker. Like Adi Shankaracharya, whose life and outlook Vivekananda seemed to have mirrored in many ways – the disciple of the mystic Ramkrishna  had something to offer to each person. Swami Vivekananda preached not only   (selfless action) but also emphasized the ethos of   and   (devotion and intellectual quest). This apart, Vivekananda had an impish sense of humour, and would have surely been very amused by the bickering among his blind followers, and detractors. It would be foolish to suggest or believe that he can be owned and monopolised by any partisan / sectarian group. Indians and foreigners alike will continue to be enriched by his teachings, and Vivekananda will remain a living presence above political skirmishes. Therefore, apprehensions about the misappropriation of Vivekananda are totally misplaced.

On Friday, 9 November, at a Medtronic conference in Los Angeles, eminent Indian-American Dr Sampat Shivangi introduced Gabbard, 37, and said that she could be the next president of the US in 2020. The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didn’t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didn’t deny it either. Tulsi Gabbard is an American politician of the Democratic Party serving as the US Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district since 2013. Gabbard, who represents a constituency in Hawaii, is not of Indian descent and neither of her parents are Hindu, but she practises Hinduism. Gabbard was born in 1981 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children born to Carol and Mike Gabbard, a State Senator. In 2002, Gabbard became the youngest person ever to be elected to the Hawaii State Legislative, and in 2012, she was elected to the US House. She went on to win the general election by nearly 80 points. She is one of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, and she was deployed with the Hawaii National Guard to Iraq in 2005 and Kuwait in 2009. According to a report in , Gabbard became one of the most popular political figures after she broke with the Democratic Party establishment and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016, even resigning as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to be able to do so. In 2004, Gabbard volunteered to join the 29 Brigade of US soldiers when they were called to war in Iraq. According to Gabbard’s website, “She (Gabbard) felt it was more important to stand in solidarity with her fellow soldiers than to climb the political ladder.” However, Gabbard’s critics have questioned her views on foreign policy and her tolerance of dictators like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard came under attack after she met Assad in 2017. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Trapper, she said that she hadn’t planned on meeting him but when the opportunity arose, she did, because she felt it was important. Democratic leaders maintained silence on one of their leaders meeting a head of state who has been dubbed a war criminal by the US. Then, in April 2017, Gabbard’s stand on the chemical attack in Syria raised eyebrows again. According to an article in  , in 2015, Gabbard was among the Democrats who voted for restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She had also expressed “skepticism” about the widely held assertion that Assad’s government was behind chemical attacks in Syria. After the 2002 Gujarat riots, the US government had denied a visa to Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Gabbard was one of the few to criticise the US government’s decision. According to an article in  , five months after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India, Gabbard opposed a resolution which called for “religious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials,” saying that it would weaken India-US relations. In August 2014, Gabbard made it a point to meet Modi in New York after his Madison Square Garden speech and presented him a copy of the  that she swore by when she was elected. Before that, in August 2014, speaking at a fundraising event for the BJP in Georgia, US, Gabbard had hailed Modi’s 2014 landslide victory and said, “People (of India) stood up, one by one by one by one, and said ‘we will demand that this change occurs’.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

His charismatic personality electrified audiences, and his organisational skills were unmatched. His influence on other freedom fighters – from Yogi Aurobindo to Netaji Subhas C Bose – is just as incomparable. It was not only fellow Indians who came under Vivekananda’s spell. He was arguably the first and most successful brand ambassador of a resurgent India in the USA, spreading his teaching far and wide. Vivekananda strove to combat superstition, to get rid of the deadwood of ritual that was  stifling those who followed the Hindu way of life, and left behind a large body of written work, reinterpreting the Vedanta for modern times. Vivekananda’s ways were unorthodox. The cigar-smoking monk had no problem with those who ate meat. He freely borrowed from whatever he felt was the best practice in other religions. His favourite word was ‘strength’ – he exhorted fellow Indians to be strong in body and spirit. He was compassionate and liberal in his outlook. For him, there was no religion greater than serving the wretched – the poor, the ailing, and the oppressed. The ochre robes of a Hindu monk have become a red rag for these scholars who bore the heavy  . Vivekananda became a symbol of what was termed   strident and aggressive. They failed to see that Vivekananda continued to mesmerise the young and old across the length and breadth of India, long after his death. Calendar art bears testimony to this – the undisputed Trimurti of Swami Vivekananda, Shaheed Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhash Bose continue to adorn the walls of many homes even today. Those who are agitated today about the appropriation of Vivekananda by the Sangh Parivar and are desperate to reclaim him, must ask themselves this question – why and how had they remained blind to the multifaceted contributions of this exceptional Indian? Today the Congress and other parties in opposition are desperately trying to get a foothold in the hearts and minds of voters who proudly proclaim their adherence to ‘Sanatana Dharma’. Simultaneously, strategists are working overtime on how best to market ‘Soft Hinduism’ to counter the machinations of the Hindutva Brigade. In the short term, this opportunism may bring some dividends, but it is bound to eventually boomerang. The  believed in service before self, and couldn’t stand hypocrisy. He examined the past with ruthless detachment and tested everything with razor-sharp intelligence. He was indeed a pioneering moderniser. At the same time, one can not surgically separate the social reformer from the spiritual seeker. Like Adi Shankaracharya, whose life and outlook Vivekananda seemed to have mirrored in many ways – the disciple of the mystic Ramkrishna  had something to offer to each person. Swami Vivekananda preached not only   (selfless action) but also emphasized the ethos of   and   (devotion and intellectual quest). This apart, Vivekananda had an impish sense of humour, and would have surely been very amused by the bickering among his blind followers, and detractors. It would be foolish to suggest or believe that he can be owned and monopolised by any partisan / sectarian group. Indians and foreigners alike will continue to be enriched by his teachings, and Vivekananda will remain a living presence above political skirmishes. Therefore, apprehensions about the misappropriation of Vivekananda are totally misplaced. One doesn’t even have to be a believer – far less a Hindu – to admire Vivekananda, and acknowledge his seminal contribution to the making of modern India.

It is extremely unfortunate for the bureau, as it hosts officers of impeccable integrity. They would indeed feel disturbed and so would the citizens who frequently demand CBI investigation in complicated, sensitive and controversial crimes. Criminal cases against its former directors – Ranjit Sinha and AP Singh – to say nothing of the unceremonious transfer of its past Special Director Rupak Dutta, tipped to be the director in 2017 – are some of the recent instances that have cast a shadow over the bureau. But more so, on the procedure followed for selecting the top boss of the agency. In the process, merit is relegated to the back burner, as was in the case of the untimely transfer of Rupak Dutta to ‘accommodate’ the current incumbent Alok Verma, and the controversial induction/promotion of the Special Director Rakesh Asthana. The high-powered panel for the selection of the director of the CBI has as three members ie the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. Yet, two of its past directors have been tainted – they have been accused in criminal cases. It is thus a poignant comment on the selection procedure, and a travesty of the highest order. The CBI comes under the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), thus directly under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It has a presence in most states in the country. The Bureau has also been notified as the Interpol of India for the purpose of liaison with police organisations of other countries, and to facilitate cooperation in international cases. There are two types of officers in the CBI – directly recruited officer investigators / support staff, and investigators and supervisors inducted on deputation from outside. The leadership lies with the Indian Police Service (IPS), with officers selected from all over the country. The CBI does not have a policy like the Intelligence Bureau (IB) or Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wherein the officers on deputation can get permanently absorbed. At any given time, there are about 20 percent and above vacancies, for various reasons like state police officers being unwilling to come on deputation etc. As per the CBI manual, the superintendent and above have specified powers for registration of cases, and the CBI follows it scrupulously. An officer of a particular rank can register an economic offence of a particular magnitude at his / her level, and to go above that, they need the permission of the rank above them. Similar guidelines on the basis of ranks exist for registering offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. There are legal advisers at each stage of investigation, and a follow-up of cases in courts is quite good. However, on occasion, the quality of its investigation and prosecution have been criticised by the courts as in the 2G spectrum allocation case recently. At other times, the courts have come down heavily on the CBI’s decisions, with the Supreme Court terming it as ‘caged parrot’ and ‘His master’s voice’. The internal vigilance wing has often nabbed some of its corrupt officers and prosecutors, proving that the CBI has its own black sheep. The pendency of cases however is mounting, despite special courts designated to handle CBI cases. These are issues of serious concern. In most cases, the investigation is of high standard, and the investigating officers are encouraged to pursue the collection of scientific evidence. The conviction rate is higher in CBI cases, as the investigating officers do not have to handle other departments like law and order / security/ VIP duties. They devote their full time to investigation. When I joined the Bureau in 1999, I was impressed by the depth of discussion and focus on investigation. I also found that the investigating officers took much longer to complete an investigation – some in the hope that more cases would not come their way if they go slow on the earlier ones! But by and large, the work culture and environment had been highly professional. During the '90s, the Bureau was given more resources, and the millennium saw special allowances – 25 percent of the pay for ranks up to the Superintendent of Police, and 15 percent, for ranks above it. The officers also feel that they do not have the facilities and amenities of local police investigation units. Still the conviction rate (of above 65 percent), is one of the best in the country. The more recently created National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take decades to come up to the benchmark set by the CBI. In most of the cases, the investigators work independently, but in some cases, there are pressures from different quarters. Most officers are able to withstand these pressures, as documentation is very strong within the CBI. If you are able to justify your stand on paper, it is difficult to be overruled. However, some officers do find cunning ways to bypass these, including taking legal opinion in their favour. Courts intervene occasionally and initiate direct supervision with clear direction not to transfer/shift the investigating officers and the supervisors – as was the case with the investigation of the 2G spectrum allocation case, and coal scam cases. With a professional work culture, a strong internal vigilance wing, and an internationally-acclaimed training set-up, the Central Bureau of Investigation holds its head high – more often than not. On the whole, having worked in the CBI, I can safely vouch for its professionalism, and fervently hope that the current director and special director resolve their differences for a higher cause, that is, the ethos of their organisation. Both officers being from the Indian Police Service, should stand up for the ‘service of the people’ and NOT for ‘the service of the party in power’.

But it is also equally true for the filmmakers themselves, who are often stuck in the past, unresponsive to the present environment, reacting to it only through memories. And then there are those filmmakers who receive an instant emotional blow from the socio-political situation of the present and hurl away the burden of the past to deliver a message for the present. His cinema can be divided into distinct periods, etching out the contemporary sensibilities of the times they were made in. My first experience of a Mrinal Sen film was of    which shows a young boy dying of suffocation on a winter night, in a middle-class Bengali household’s kitchen. I had seen   only too often — working in the houses of some of my friends, whom I would visit after school. Mrinal Sen’s    , which shows a film crew attempting to make a film based on the Bengal famine (set in a village of the day), fuses the horrors of history with the struggles of contemporary life. The classical structure of a ‘film within a film’ has been used by Sen to show how fiction and reality often converge. Durga, an ordinary village woman, who witnesses the film shoot, begins to empathise with a character portrayed in the film. The hardships faced by Durga in real life, and this character, are very similar. Mrinal Sen also depicts the exploitation of the innocent, ignorant villagers at the hands of the privileged film personalities. Sen made this film at a time when he wanted to study characters through a socio-political lens — understanding their responses, moral dilemmas, self-corruption and exploitation, which can then provoke the spectator to start a discussion. In dramas like   and  Sen sheds light on the moralities of the society of the day, especially exposing the so-called Bhadralok (gentleman) culture. In  , a middle-class family’s fate hangs in the balance as their eldest daughter, the sole breadwinner, fails to come home one night. Similarly, in  , the father, the family’s patriarch, goes missing. My understanding of Mrinal Sen completely changed once I went to college and got involved in the politics of the day. I had a lot to say, and I was ready to shout over the burst of other voices. Mrinal Sen started ‘shouting out his own politics’ with his cult-classic   at a time when the Naxalite movement was at its peak, and world cinema was highly influenced by the French New Wave and Czech New Wave. The film is highly stylised with use of freeze frames and stop-motion animation. An animation sequence builds up the character of Shome (who is mostly engrossed in office work) through pens, books, files, sheets, but without actually showing him. Thus, Sen developed a new language for Indian filmmakers, giving birth to the Indian New Wave. The period demanded that Sen shout out his views over ear-blasting bombings and cries of mothers of youths shot dead by police. Mrinal Sen’s   trilogy, a set of overly political films narrated in the new vocabulary of the day, also emerged around the same time. Sen breaks the fourth wall in  , and directly speaks to the camera.  and   the other two films in the  trilogy – both deal with questions of leadership and exploitation by the higher-ups. Sen used ‘juxtaposition’ as an important cinematic tool to jar the spectators out of the illusion of cinema. Mrinal Sen’s cinema has not only inspired other films, but also compelled other filmmakers to document his life and work. The creation of a new wave in Indian cinema, which was subsequently continued by the likes of Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Shyam Benegal, can be credited to Sen. Sen completely distrusts Ramani’s presence and his sensibilities — Sen’s aura, comes out with an absolute honesty in the final documentary, which in the last sequence, cuts to Sen watching himself on screen as Ramani shows him the footage for approval. Mrinal Sen, the ‘master’ smiles at his ‘other self’, jarred out of illusion into realism through his most favourite cinematic device of all — the ‘cut’. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 3 July 1995, Delhi woke up to a crime that was less gruesome in execution but was brutal enough when it came to removing evidence, including the victim’s body. In the post-liberalisation era, even as blaring 24*7 news channels were yet to arrive on the scene, few newspapers made sure that the readers had every salacious bit on their platter daily. The accused Sushil Sharma, a former Youth Congress leader, someone who was known for his proximity to senior leaders, had shot his wife dead and then tried to burn her body.  It was perhaps the sheer grit and dogged effort by Pereira and his team which ensured that Sharma was behind bars. But it wasn’t so easy for the Delhi Police that faced many challenges during investigation, as explained vividly by Pereira in his book,  . This observation was contrary to the claim by the police that Naina Sahni's death was caused due to injury caused by a bullet wound with the shot being fired from a very close range. The police had retrieved bullets and empty cartridges from Sushil Sharma's flat at Mandir Marg where traces of blood were found on the mattress in the bedroom. Just because the X-ray machine at the Lady Hardinge Medical College was non-functional and the body was burnt beyond recognition, the first autopsy report had overlooked the injury mark in the corpse caused by the bullets. It was the second autopsy report that favoured the sequence of events as was established by the Delhi Police in its probe. Pereira feels that such procedural hassles are part of the job for investigating officers: Speaking to  , Pereira also shared how important it was for the police force then in 1995 to win back the confidence of people. Sharma was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2007. On 8 October 2013, the Supreme Court commuted Sushil Sharma’s death sentence to life imprisonment. In its judgment, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, P Sathasivam had  : The Court was of the view that chances of reformation of Sharma can’t be ruled out. Sushil Sharma has already served 23 years behind bars. So should he now be allowed to live a normal life outside jail on grounds of good behaviour? It was this question that resulted in a fierce debate between the author and audience at the book launch. A counselor at the Tihar Jail, who was present at the book launch, shared her experience of interacting with Sharma, as she claimed, “he regrets his action”. In 2016, the Supreme Court   that “a sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years”. Which means that the release of Sushil Sharma would be tough “unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentence”. According to Maxwell Pereira, “the police had done its job and now it’s up to the institutions who take decisions on such matters”. What happened to Constable Abdul Nazeer Kunju, the man, who was on night duty at the Connaught Place police station on 2 July 1995? It was Kunju who had rushed inside the Bagiya restaurant after a woman came out shouting,  It was Kunju who first spotted Sushil along with his friend Keshav as both were busy throwing pamphlets and posters into the fire. ‘He left the police service’, Pereira told the audience, when he was asked about Kunju. After his stint as the hero, who had helped in unravelling a gruesome crime, it was the slow pace of promotion in the hierarchical setup of the police that led to Kunju calling it quits. While Kunju was able to resist all the efforts of Sushil Sharma to intimidate him, the poor guy found it difficult to overcome disillusionment that dawned after years of performing his duties with utmost sincerity. Lack of motivation is perhaps among the many ills ailing the police force. Pereira still reminisces the ability of Kunju to react fast to an unwarranted situation, which in this case, led to the discovery of a charred body:       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 23 November 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were travelling by bus from Hyderabad to Sangli in Mahrashtra. While on the way, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) stopped the bus and abducted the couple. Three days later, on 26 November, Sohrabuddin was shot dead in what the police called an encounter, but it was later found to be fake by the investigators. In total, several prosecution witnesses have deposed before the court since 29 November 2017. The same day, the special CBI court passed a gag order restraining media from reporting the case based on an application by the defence lawyer. On 24 January this year, the Bombay High Court struck down the gag order. According to sources, all hostile witnesses are crucial, and some of them are also eyewitnesses in the case. Among these, five of their statements were recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, while others had theirs recorded by the investigating agency. Below are details of the testimony/statements of 13 crucial witnesses: , the sister of Kalimuddin, an associate of Sohrabuddin, had stated to the investigating agency that her brother hosted Sohrabuddin and his wife in Hyderabad in mid-November 2005. It is from their house that Sohrabuddin and his wife left for Sangli. Kalimuddin was also wanted in several criminal cases by the Andhra Pradesh Police. But during cross-examination, Saleema denied even having met Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi. Saleema’s retraction of her earlier statement will impact the case because this raises questions over whether Sohrabuddin and his wife went to Hyderabad or boarded the bus to Sangli. Here are the names of some other hostile witnesses: According to the prosecution, key witnesses turning hostile is a major setback for the case. According to a legal expert: Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had boarded a luxury bus from Hyderabad to go to Sangli in Maharashtra at around 9 pm on 22 November 2005. But while they were on the way, a group of policemen from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh allegedly kidnapped them. A passenger inside the bus told the investigator that an SUV blocked their bus and three policemen with guns abducted Sohrabuddin and his wife. Kausar Bi refused to allow the police to take him, and so she too was abducted by the police. Based on the statements of some witnesses, Sohrabuddin and his wife were brought to Ahmedabad’s Disha Farm where both of them were illegally detained and later killed, according to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI. According to the Gujarat ATS, Sohrabuddin was a sharp shooter and had underworld connections. He had come to the city at the behest of the Lashker-e-Taiba and the ISI to assassinate a political leader. The Gujarat Police acted on the basis of an intelligence input from the Rajasthan Police, who were also part of the encounter team. The Gujarat Police also claimed that Sohrabuddin was wanted in an arms case in Madhya Pradesh and in a murder case in Rajasthan. According to the Gujarat police, Sohrabuddin was operating from Narol area in Ahmedabad, when the police spotted him riding a bike near the Vishala circle, they tried to intercept but he didn't stop. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sohrabuddin shot at policemen and in self-defence police retaliated, killing him. They offer no explanation for how Kausar Bi was killed. Some key witnesses who are yet to be cross-examined in court are:  once a close associate of Sohrabuddin, turned hostile from his earlier statement recorded before the CBI. In an affidavit before the designated CBI court, witness claimed that the statements attributed to him against the former Deputy Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, Abhay Chudasma, and others, were “taken by the investigating agency under duress.” He also charged the CBI with “acting on the instructions of Congress leaders of Gujarat.” In 2006,  the IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was made the supervisory officer of the Sohrabuddin case before it was handed over to the CBI. Solanki’s investigation revealed that apart from Sohrabuddin, Kausar Bi was also killed as a coverup. This revelation led to the arrests of Gujarat-cadre IPS officers DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian, and Dinesh MN of the Rajasthan cadre. Later, the CBI, in its findings, charge-sheeted Geetha Johri for allegedly botching up the investigation. The agency accused her of projecting that the third person abducted along with Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi was a person named Kalimuddin and not Tulsiram Prajapati. The first investigating officer of the Gujarat Police gave a statement to the CBI against  , saying she was working under pressure from now Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah. She botched-up the case by giving a false report stating that third person on the bus was not Tulsiram Prajapati. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Raje’s government? Pilot goes on to say, “So, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara ji’s government. So it’s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Raje’s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.” From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to ‘Gaurav Yatra’, Raje should have taken out a ‘Pashchatap Yatra’. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congress’s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. It’s illegal, it’s immoral to use taxpayers’ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJP’s money to organise meetings? “Today, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,” continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congress’s counter-narrative to Raje’s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had ‘mera booth, mera gaurav’ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the ‘Shakti’ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. That’s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, “We (Congress) are doing ‘Sankalp’ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.” Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback we’ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So it’s a very positive indication, and I’m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, we’ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And that’s where I think the Congress party’s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Even as the TDP MLA was jailed, a tape was produced (and leaked to TV channels) where a voice suspiciously similar to that of Chandrababu Naidu’s, was found saying something incriminating. This was an opportunity for KCR’s Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to poach TDP MLAs who Naidu had told to fend for themselves. At the same time, to ensure that Andhra industrialists did not flee to Andhra Pradesh leaving Hyderabad high and dry, KCR appointed his son KT Rama Rao (KTR) to woo them. The savvy KTR, who is IT and Urban Development Minister in KCR’s government, was able to win the confidence of these industrialists who were at the receiving end during the Telangana statehood movement. Naidu is hailed as the father of modern Hyderabad, who got Microsoft and other IT investments. But KTR is following in his footsteps and has been able to woo many others. “Hyderabad is a boom town now,” is the refrain of investors. Although he is believed to have strategised Naidu’s victory in 1999, Naidu jettisoned KCR, relegating him to the post of the Assembly’s deputy speaker. A miffed KCR left TDP and formed TRS to fight for a separate state. The new state was created by Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the 2014 elections. Before Telangana was announced, KCR had declared his allegiance to Sonia — who he said was like his own ‘mother’ and even promised to merge his party into the Congress if ‘he was given a free hand.’ But none of this happened, and the TRS and Congress are now arch rivals. Even as KCR wants to decimate the Congress, analysts aver that he has a tacit understanding with the BJP because this is what the saffron party also wants. However, in April 2017, KCR got a bill passed in the Telangana Assembly to provide reservations to backward Muslims in colleges and for jobs. This is unlikely to be notified by the central government, because reservations on religious basis have been struck down by the courts. Moreover, with the latest proposals, total reservations will go way beyond the constitutionally mandated upper limit of 50 percent. KCR, who runs the state with an iron hand and has promoted his daughter and nephew besides his son, is seen as a wily politician with a clear game plan in mind. This is why he is being taken seriously as he unfolds the federal front plan. K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is a man known for setting his goals high. Figuring that the ‘Modi magic’ of 2014 has all but vanished and has not been replaced by a Rahul Gandhi upsurge, KCR is fancying his chances as the next prime minister of India, suggest highly-placed sources. Donning the robe of a messiah, KCR has been announcing that “People are vexed that there is no qualitative change, even after 70 years of democracy.” KCR, as has been reported, travelled to Kolkata to confabulate with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for forming a federal front. He has also met CPM’s Sitaram Yechury with the same idea. The leaders of many likely federal front partners with more seats (like Mamata with 42 seats in West Bengal) might harbour prime ministerial ambitions themselves. But KCR, with his proficiency in both Hindi and English, and being from south India, feels that he has an edge over others (What does the first-time woman voter want?

As the Legislative Assembly goes to polls on 7 December, narratives of families of farmer suicides in the prosperous Nalgonda district, highlight how little their life has changed. Nalgonda has the highest number of farmer suicides, according to data available since the state’s formation. Kathula Venkataiah, 45, committed suicide like thousands of farmers do every year in India, because of crop failure and unpaid debts. But this farmer suicide was different. A resident of Manimadde village of Shali Gowraram mandal in Nalgonda district, Venkataiah was a staunch supporter of the separate state of Telangana. He had participated in village marches and believed that Telangana’s statehood would be the best solution for the rural distress he himself faced, and witnessed around him. And yet, he killed himself 12 days after the formation of Telangana on 2 June 2014. Inability to repay debt was the main reason for Venkataiah’s suicide; he had owed Rs 4,30,000 at the time of his death, according to official documents. As Venkataiah did not own land, banks had trouble lending to him, and he borrowed from private moneylenders on an interest of Rs 1.50 to Rs 2. This dependence on private moneylenders is despite over 83 percent rural access to bank credit, according to the same report. Further, government schemes like Rythu Bandhu, are meant for farmers who cultivate their own land, and not for tenant/landless farmers who are the worst affected by distress. A report by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with TISS in 2018, finds that 20 percent of land in the state is cultivated by tenant farmers, but they account for 75 percent of farmer suicides in Telangana. The children of tenant farmers face a different challenge; there is no land to farm, and education does not lead to employment. Even with 64.2 percent literacy rate, Nalgonda district has only 49.9 percent working population, according to the 2011 Census. It is not surprising therefore, that after Venkataiah’s death, all his three children dropped out of school to earn a livelihood instead. In Manimadde village, where the family met this reporter this week, they live in a half-constructed two-room house of cement and brick. Part of the state compensation paid after Venkataiah’s death had gone into building the house, but was not enough to finish it. In another part of Nalgonda in Chandanpally village, Rupani Radha recalls the death of her husband, Janayya, in November 2014, four months after the formation of Telangana state. She now supports three children between the ages of 8-14 years, through farm labour, and by cultivating cotton on 2 acres of rain-fed land that used to belong to her husband. The land is now in the name of her 8-year-old son, transferred by her husband’s family after his death. This has proved a hurdle for getting benefits of government schemes as her son is not of age. Welfare had failed to assist her in times of need. For instance, when she had to undergo a surgery for kidney stones in June 2018, she had to borrow Rs 1 lakh from private sources. She says that the free health scheme ‘Aarogyasri’ would have taken time to come though, and she could not wait. And now, after the surgery, the loan has added to her burden as she is unable to do farm labour to repay it. Radha’s only other option is agriculture. “I must work as farm labour to pay for the cotton crop on our field. I have harvested about 5 quintals, which will fetch me about Rs 20,000, but I will make no profit,” she says. But like Narsamma, even Radha must reconcile to the indifference of the state that no longer needs the farmer, except perhaps, during elections.  ‘ ’ by        (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Founded in 1959, by C Rajagopalachari, one of India’s greatest political thinkers and leaders, as well as literary giants, Swatantra Party arrived on the Indian political scene with a bash. The archive features correspondences, office memorandums, meeting minutes, speech drafts, party literature and publications, and many personal notes shared by the party leaders, allowing us a glimpse into the life of the party as it was conceived, formed, and introduced to the larger Indian political scene. A small correspondence between Indira Gandhi and MR Masani, notes shared by Masani and Rajaji are among the many treasures housed in the archive. In the letter issued from the Prime Ministers Office on 12 March 1967, Indira Gandhi invites Mr Masani to join her in an informal meeting with parliamentary leaders, before the inaugural session of Lok Sabha. The letter reads: “I write this to invite you to an informal meeting of Leaders of different Parties in Parliament so that we have an opportunity of meeting one another on the eve of the session and to exchange views on matters of common interest. I should like to maintain similar contact throughout the session if you find the idea appropriate and useful. I wonder if we could have our first meeting at 10 am on 15th March in my office in Parliament House. I hope you will find it convenient to join.” A handwritten note by C Rajagopalachari, addressed to Mr Homi Mody, a lawyer, administrator, businessman, and social reformer is another valuable find. Homi, a moniker for Sir Hormasji Pherozshah Modi, held a variety of public offices as Chairman of Bombay Municipal Corporation (1913), a member of Indian legislative assembly (1929-1943), a member of Viceroy’s Executive Council (1943), a member of Constituent Assembly of India, and governor of United Provinces and Uttar Pradesh (1949-52). In the note C Rajagopalachari expresses his gratitude to Mody for leading the early collection efforts to establish the corpus of funds for the party. Written on 20 October 1959 – Swatantra's founding year – the note states, “It was kind of you to write and give a cheerful account of the collection work. I had intended to write to our staff about the need for active assistance but as I have just read your letter, I feel it is unnecessary. I cannot tell you how greatly I feel heartened by your continued support. Tyranny cannot be brought to an end until the victims shed fear. Our 'friends' are going to get more and more autocratic and dictatorial seeing that we are gathering strength...” The archive has been successfully restored and digitised by the efforts of the Centre for Civil Society as a part of its Indian Liberals digital archive project, and will be placed at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library for public engagement, and will soon be available on the open Indian Liberal website for visitors. According to Rajaji, a liberal democracy rests on four pillars, or feet: an active citizenry, prudent statesmen, a responsible parliament, and independent judiciary. The party was Rajaji’s response to the rise of what he saw as the ‘one-footed’ democracy—a monolithic Congress system, which had erupted due to the absence of a sustained and principled opposition, and a fractured electoral system which rewarded expensive campaigns mounted by those in power with subsequent victories. Rajaji’s greatest concern was the rise of majoritarianism, which he felt was eroding the democratic nature of our public institutions. Congress’ eclipsing victories at national and state level in the 1950s, the abuse of ordinances by the Nehru Government in the early 1950s as a means to subvert scrutiny by both houses, the misuse of Ninth Schedule to overcome judicial review, and the increase in instances of agitation and boycott by Parliamentarians troubled Rajaji, for they threatened to erode the sanctity of institutional procedures. Writing on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 1963, he argued “democracy in a pluralist society is sustained not by force of numbers but by the vital force of trust, the maintenance of which must, therefore be the greatest concern of statesmen guiding democracies.” No less than a year old, it commanded the presence of many of India’s greatest statesmen and thinkers. M R Masani, Dahyabhai Patel (son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Sir Homi Mody, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, VP Menon, Maridas Ruthnaswamy, N G Ranga, and more. The party boasted of a wide and diverse leadership, bringing together voices from the South as well as Northern India, peasant and agrarian activists and aristocrats on one platform. The party had offices and regional centres in Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Patna, with units in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It was the only national party to not have an office in Delhi, and this was done to ensure candidates and party leaders stayed close to their respective constituencies. The party also held one of the few female members of royal families to participate in electoral politics: Maharani Gayatri Devi, who campaigned relentlessly for the party in the 1962 elections. While the party performed well in the general elections of 1962 and 1967, it could not withstand the rising forces of extremism and majoritarianism in the 1970s, and floundered after Rajaji’s demise in 1974 – only a few months before the imposition of Emergency.

He is the son of Jaswant Singh, a tall Rajpur leader who, despite being one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was denied a ticket to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This battle for Manvendra is a personal one that he did not want to fight in the first place. Vasundhara Raje has been winning from this seat for three consecutive terms, and the margin she is winning by has also steadily increased from 27,000 in 2003 to 61,000 votes in 2013. What do you think will work in your favour? I think every election is a different situation. Particularly in 2018, where the politics of Rajasthan has taken a huge turn. There is an underswell against a particular kind of governance, which is palpable under the surface across the state. Coming here, I feel the underswell is also covered with a huge campaign against tyranny. All polls have predicted a Congress win in the state, sir. You are Jaswant Singh’s son, you have won before, you are politically relevant in Mewar. So, would it have been better for you to stand from Barmer as opposed to here, where you are contesting against somebody who has  a political legacy here for 30-35 years, and has been an MLA here for three consecutive terms? Certainly it would have been better to stand from the Barmer-Jodhpur side, but that is if I wanted to contest and I did not want to contest. So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didn’t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, “Make an offer I cannot refuse.” So yeah, they made an offer I couldn’t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But don’t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I don’t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised they’ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. I’ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasn’t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? I’m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you can’t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didn’t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her – your wife, Chitra Singh – of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I don’t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

But just a few months ago, Michel had reportedly gone missing. Michel’s lawyer, Amal Alsubei had told   that Michel had gone missing from the day UAE went to the court. Alsubei also added that the middleman in the Rs 3,600 crore deal will be arrested when found, and that he is likely to appeal in Supreme Court. According to the reports, on 26 August, UAE had asked a court on the possibility of extraditing a British national, not specifically Michel, to a third country,   reported. The reports of Michel going missing came a day after reports of a UAE court ordering extradition of the middleman to India surfaced. Michel was arrested in the UAE in 2017 and was out on bail then. At the time of the Rs 3,600-crore scam (early 2013), Christian Michel was a well-known British consultant who was very active in the Indian defence sector. It was alleged that he was hired by AgustaWestland to facilitate the deal for the supply of 12 helicopters to India in 2010. Michel is one of the three middlemen being probed in the case, besides Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa, by the ED and CBI. The ED had also brought on the record that the three middlemen \"managed to\" make inroads into the Indian Air Force (IAF) to influence the stand of officials to reduce the service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres in 2005, according to PTI. AgustaWestland became eligible to supply the dozen helicopters for VVIP flying duties after this change. Moreover, according to ED investigation, remittances made by Michel through his Dubai-based firm Global Services to a media firm he floated in Delhi, along with two Indians, were made from the funds which he got from AgustaWestland through “criminal activity” and corruption being done in the chopper deal, reported PTI. In July 2018, after he was granted bail in Dubai, Michel had accused Indian investigators of pressuring him to name UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and frame senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in return for a clean chit in the multi-crore scam. On 19 July, while he was in custody, his lawyer Rosemary Patrizi had made similar charges against the Indian probe agencies, although CBI had denied the allegations.

Tasked with guarding borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, the force has a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of nation. 53 years ago, policy makers conceived of a force capable of guarding borders during peace, and to assist the army as the first line of defence during hostilities, because of the inability of the disparate State Armed Forces to stand up to even minor threats from Pakistani forces, and lack of uniformity in dealing with its counterparts. The force has grown from about 25,000 in 1965, to about 2.5 lakhs now. This mammoth growth has been in spurts, causing many problems of human resource management. The policy planners erred in ensuring a smooth phased expansion to prevent the personnel management dilemma that the force is now faced with. However, the one-time benefits of such rapid expansion has reached its saturation point, and the personnel are now stagnating for long periods, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralisation. A  takes anything from 20 to 24 years to earn his first promotion. The situation of the cadre officers of the force has always been precarious, with most of them retiring at the middle rungs. Efforts to address the problem of stagnation have lacked vision, and amounted only to fire fighting. For example, in order to bring parity with the police, the ranks of Lance Naik were abolished, thus disturbing the rank structure of a “section” which is the basic sub-unit. Similarly, the introduction of the rank of assistant sub inspector has disturbed the structure of “platoon”. The cadre review exercise for officers has, without aiming for long-term solutions, resulted only in one-time postponement of stagnation through proliferation of ranks in the battalions. Avenues created at higher levels do not accrue to cadre officers because of the rule position, and these have been usurped by IPS officers. He frequently encounters life-threatening situations, but is now not entitled to pension which his counterpart in defence forces get. Large numbers of BSF units are deployed on the Line of Control, and perform the same duties as the Army. Yet, he gets almost 25 percent less than his Army counterpart. Further, in case of an unfortunate death in the line of duty, the family of a deceased BSF soldier is deprived of many benefits available to the family of an Army Jawan, because there is no provision for a BSF soldier to be declared a martyr. BSF personnel spend most of their life on BOPs where the extended duty hours – sometimes 16 per day, enable only an interrupted sleep. To make matters worse, the living conditions at most of the BOPs are unsatisfactory. A recent report stated that out of the 66 BOPs in Barmer sector of BSF, only two had facilities for piped drinking water. The rest depended upon water tankers. The above conditions coupled with the inability to meet urgent family obligations, cause a lot of stress, resulting in a high rate of attrition. As per a reply to a parliament question, 11,192 BSF personnel have either resigned or proceeded on voluntary retirement from 2015 up-to Jan 2018. The prevalent security environment now – both internal and external – is vastly different from that in 1965. The proxy war by Pakistan has kept our western borders troubled, requiring aggressive border management practices. The Bangladesh border grapples with a threat of a different kind, with armed cattle smugglers attacking BSF soldiers, when intercepted. Heavy population density, lack of development and employment opportunities makes these borders highly crime prone. The BSF is thus faced with the policy dilemma of averting use of force to conform to the national objective of maintaining good relations with Bangladesh, and ensuring the safety and security of soldiers, while preventing crime. Man-power intensive border guarding practices are no longer adequate, and suitable technology has to be introduced to assist border men. Technological interventions in the shape of first and second generation NVDs have had a rather limited effect, and the situation on ground remains unchanged. These devices, besides having out lived their life, are cumbersome and  user-friendly. The organisation also has not invested in familiarizing troops with the usage of these devices, which is another reason for reluctance on the part of troops to use them. The technology sought to be introduced is generally vendor-driven, which more often than not, fails on ground. Trials must be carried out over an extended period in operational conditions before induction. Aspects of training in their use, maintenance etc must also be built in the contract to prevent long turn over time for repairs. Proper facilities should be created at BOPs to derive optimum advantage from devices like Thermal Imagers. Annual competition to encourage innovation remains just an event, and none of the projects have been taken up for large scale production to ease the burden on troops. The mindset of the commanders therefore, requires a generational change, as the constabulary now is educated and well-informed. To be able to adopt “smart border management” practices they should be encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and adequate training in use of technical gadgets introduced in the force. The training philosophy also needs to orient itself with the present day operational environment. While western borders need aggressive domination and “Ek goli ek dushman” type of training is still relevant, the eastern borders require troops to exercise restraint. This must therefore be incorporated in the basic induction training, and also when troops get deployed in those areas. Frequent deployment in counter-insurgency operations also necessitates incorporation of these aspects in the training. As mentioned above, border guarding is rapidly transforming into integrated border management where several agencies are equal stake holders. Borders will, in the near future, transform from barriers to bridges between nations. A smart border man therefore has to be aware of the developing scenario and understand the functioning of different agencies involved with the functioning of “integrated check posts” and “land custom stations” to facilitate the hassle-free movement of personnel and goods across the borders. Trained in policing duties, they are unable to come to grips with the complexities a large organisation like the BSF, and the dynamics of border management. The government has to give a serious thought and rectify this anomalous situation by handing over the baton to cadre officers, who, over the years, have acquired enough experience and maturity to take up the responsibility.

Navjot Singh Sidhu had also clarified on Friday, 30 November, that he didn't go there on the instructions of his party Chief Rahul Gandhi. “The whole world knows I went on PM Imran Khan’s personal invite,” he wrote on Twitter: Earlier, on Sunday, 2 December, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu had clarified that he did not mean any disrespect to Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh.

On Monday, 26 November, Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone at the Indian side at Dera Baba Nanak, three kilometers from the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak spent the last 17 years of his life. If this project reaches fruition by next November, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, it could mark a seachange in relations between arch rivals India and Pakistan. It could also set a precedent for the role religion can play to bring peace among erstwhile enemy nations and become a clarion call for peace in South Asia. Perhaps the most common critique of all religions is Karl Marx's phrase: opiate of the masses. The fact is that this phrase follows a longer sentence in which Marx describes the value of religion in human society. “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opiate of the people.” Since Marx’s utterance, while bashing religion, we often forget the value of religion and pick only its negative consequences. There are good reasons for it. There are umpteen examples of how communalism spreads, how politicians use religion to divide society, how competitive one-upmanship leads to violence, pogroms, riots and sectarianism. The Partition of India and Pakistan is considered the greatest exile in human history. It caused one million deaths and 14 million displacements. Ordinary people turned looters and plunderers. Even neighbours turned against each other – all in the name of religion. For the Hindu and Muslim populations, the Partition caused loss of a sense of belonging to their birth and natural environments and devastated their economies. For the Sikhs, who opposed Partition, the event also caused separation from some of their most significant religious places, including the place of birth and passing away of their founder, Guru Nanak. The Sikhs prayers include the  performed in the presence of the  or for various small and big ceremonies. The  has three parts. The first and third part are fixed but the second part can be changed to suit the occasion. After 1947, the Sikhs included the following text in the second part of their  : “ ” entres of religion, from which we have been separated.” For 71 years now, in spite of how New Delhi and Islamabad define the relationship between India and Pakistan, the Sikhs have been making the prayer to unite with their Gurdwaras. The developments this week seemed impossible just three months ago when Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan and hugged their Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had proposed the corridor. The nationalist television studios, ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), called him a ‘traitor’. Sidhu was abused and mocked. Today, the same Indian government is supporting the corridor. The BJP, which has made ‘hate Pakistan’ its major agenda, would have never agreed for such a project, but came in to glorify its beleaguered alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal. The cynical propaganda against the corridor shows how far the national narrative is from both east and west Punjab whose people share language, culture, deep bonds and have always aspired for peace. The national discourse does not get a simple fact: when two Punjabis meet, they hug as a way of greeting each other. It does not get it that former cricket stalwarts Imran Khan and Navjot Sidhu seek to re-write history. Guru Nanak says: “ ” “If you yearn to play love/enter with your head on your palm.” It is that moment for India and Pakistan. The call is whether we – both nations – want to play love, in this context with our neighbour. To fall apart, the proposal just needs: The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was freely accessible until the 1960s. In the early 2000s, Pakistan made an attempt to open access, but was thwarted by the Indian government. The SAD was in power, and SGPC was in control. That is why, since then, people have been having the   through binoculars at the Border Security Force post at Dera Baba Nanak. It is set to change now. If this project succeeds, it may lead to access to other 194 Gurdwaras included in the Sikh Ardas. It may lead to better trade and cultural ties between the two Punjabs and nations. Most of all, it would lead to demilitarisation of two poverty-stricken nations and better spending on education, health-care and employment. Certainly those are what people of both nations seek from their governments. It is a razor’s edge. As we say in Punjab:      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Well-informed sources say there has been much criticism within the government, even at the highest level, of the way things have been handled. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and some in the national security establishment are said to be most displeased. Governor Satya Pal Malik, who is in the eye of the storm, even said on Wednesday, 28 November, that he might be transferred. If that indeed happens, it would be the result of his frequent public statements. Malik’s stating that the Centre wanted him to install Sajjad Lone as the chief minister, has been damaging to both Lone and those in charge at the Centre. Associates of Lone, whose People’s Conference party has two MLAs in the house, have even said that this could get him killed. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is the putative strategist who seems to have miscalculated. It was his plan that there should be a period of governor’s rule in J&K, during which the state’s administration should be cleaned up, and then a government of his choice would be installed. Amid the heartburn and criticism within the government over the past few days, top leaders have apparently made it clear that they were not party to some of the more sordid aspects of what has transpired. For instance, Mufti has alleged that central agencies such as the NIA have been misused to coerce MLAs. Lone’s associates have been very hopeful that he would be installed with the support of the BJP’s 25 MLAs and breakaway groups from the PDP, the Congress, and the National Conference. Their hopes were on a roller-coaster since July, but remained intact until last week. Their plans were overturned by the surprise move by three of the four substantial parties in the house (the other being the BJP) to form a government together. The move, which had been in the works over the previous few days, became public last Wednesday, 21 November. The house was dissolved that evening. Given the unseemly haste, it is unlikely that anyone focussed on the fact that the proposed alliance of three major parties would have been just short of two-thirds majority in the house. But the fact is that, with the help of a couple of single members, they could have attempted to amend the state’s constitution. On the other hand, the claim by the three parties acting in tandem could not be faulted. Yet, the governor initially described it as an ‘unholy alliance’. Pointing out that no formal claim had reached him, he asserted that he had played fair by not inviting either group. The three parties had come together after initial discussions at a meeting in London. The idea gathered steam even though NC leader Omar Abdullah was initially unhappy. Naturally! His party is set to gain from the general disappointment with the PDP’s governance in Kashmir. No wonder Omar has called for fresh elections since the day the BJP withdrew support to the PDP-led government in July.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Is this a mere coincidence or there is something else going on here?

However, the details of the donor and the receiver of this bond will be confidential. It's commonly believed that the party predicted to win the elections receives the maximum funds, in anticipation of the benefits that will accrue once the party gains power.

Electoral bonds were promised to be anonymous as no one other than the donors themselves are supposed to know which political party they are contributing to. ’s investigation reveals that while the public will remain clueless about who has donated to which party, the government has access to those details, collated through alphanumeric codes on the electoral bonds, which are invisible to the naked eye.

This is how the BJP candidate Yoonus Khan is pitching himself in his electoral fight against Rajasthan Congress Chief Sachin Pilot for the Tonk seat in the state assembly polls. Khan, Transport and PWD Minister in the Vasundhara Raje government, has been fielded by the BJP in the Muslim-dominated Tonk assembly constituency, replacing the party's sitting MLA Ajit Singh Mehta after the Congress gave a ticket to Pilot in Tonk. Talking to PTI while campaigning in the rural areas of Tonk, Khan said the decision to field him was based on strategy and equations, and not on his religion. Asked about being the lone Muslim candidate of the BJP and if his nomination marked a departure from the party's strategy to not field any candidates from the minority community, he said: \"I don't know about elsewhere, but in Rajasthan, Yoonus Khan and (late BJP leader) Ramzan Khan have been fighting polls since the 80s.\" Khan said he has been the party's lone Muslim candidate once earlier also. Asked if Tonk having a large number of Muslims was one of the reasons behind his candidature, the BJP leader said the election here will be on the basis of performance and agenda. \"The election will be on who can serve Tonk better. I have given my vision... As a minister I connected Sawai Madhopur road to a two-lane road. I have given a bypass.”, he said. He also vowed to solve the problem of drinking water faced by the residents of Tonk. Pitching himself as an underdog in the high-stakes electoral battle, Khan took a swipe at his Congress rival and said, \"He (Pilot) has come for the first time, I have been a minister for long...I know the workers here.\" \"For Sachin   it is a new place, people are new and apart from his dream to become an MLA and chief minister, he does not have any other dream. I am a people's servant. You can make me serve in Deedwana (his earlier constituency) and you can make me work in Tonk,\" Khan said. Khan said Pilot was the one who has been switching constituencies, while he has been fighting from the Nagaur district (under which Deedwana falls) and has come here now on the party's instructions. While addressing a gathering in Chironj village, Khan again pitched himself as a small worker of the party who is here to serve. \"I am a sevak, not a 'pilot'. Tonk also needs a sevak not a 'pilot', he said. In another jibe at the Rajasthan Congress chief's surname, Khan asked the crowd: \"Do you have an aeroplane. Do you have a helicopter?... No, then you don't need a pilot.\" Talking to PTI, he acknowledged both he and Pilot were outsiders in Tonk, but there was one difference – \"through the power that I had in my pen (as a minister), I have given roads worth Rs 2,000 crore.\" On the Congress' charge that Khan's ticket was cut from Deedwana and was finally given one from Tonk because of his religion, he said the opposition party gives statements according to its convenience. Asked if the contest in Tonk was as keen as the one in Jhalrapatan between Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress candidate Manvendra Singh, who was earlier with the saffron party, Khan said it was on-sided contest there and \"Vasundhara ji will defeat him by about 1.25 lakh votes.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

An FIR was registered by Noida Police on 22 October on the complaint of data theft and extortion by the owner of PayTm, Vijay Shekhar Sharma and his brother Ajay Shekhar Sharma. It alleged that four people tried to extort Rs 10 crore from Paytm’s owner against the stolen data. The alleged blackmailers also threatened to make the data public and defame Vijay Shekhar Sharma if ransom was not paid. The FIR named four persons as accused – Sonia Dhawan, an employee of Paytm and personal secretary of Vijay; Roopak Jain, Sonia’s husband; Devinder Kumar, Paytm employee; and Rohit Chomwal, a businessman from Kolkata. The FIR doesn’t reveal the nature of the data stolen nor has Sharma commented on the nature the data. A lot of assumptions and speculation came out in the media that the data could be related to Paytm users’ personal details, which could be misused or sold by the alleged blackmailers.  has finally got answers to what is in the stolen data. Dr Ajay Pal Sharma, Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar district has confirmed to  that the stolen data is related to Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s personal life. A reliable source has confirmed that the personal data was allegedly stolen by Devindra Kumar, one of the accused in the case. Noida Police has claimed that a CD was recovered from one of the accused which allegedly contains stolen data. The CD has been sent for Forensic examination. The FIR accessed by  reveals that Chomwal was a key player. He was directly communicating with Vijay and Ajay through WhatsApp calls and messages. The FIR says, It was he who demanded Rs 10 crore as ransom and also informed the complainants about his other accomplices. Sonia’s lawyer refused to divulge the details of the data as the matter is subjudice. A small part of the ransom money was transferred into Chomwal’s bank account in two tranches, Rs 67 and Rs 2 lakhs, on 10 and 15 October, respectively. Interestingly, the key player, Chomwal, is still at large and he has not been questioned by the police even once. Meanwhile, Sonia, Roopak and Devinder were arrested and are still in jail. Sonia’s bail application will come up for hearing on 4 December. In November 2018, Chomwal moved an application in the Allahabad High Court which gave him protection from being arrested till the investigation is completed. The   in   possession alleges that Chomwal has been wrongly accused in the case and has been made an “escape goat” (sic) especially when the petitioner (ie: Chomwal) helped Vijay Shekhar and his brother in apprehending the three ‘culprits’. The police has not clarified what evidence they have against Sonia, Roopak and Devinder to prove their involvement in the case. Is Chomwal so foolish that he will agree on the transfer of the ransom money to his bank account which can act as an evidence against him in the court? The FIR reveals that the first ransom call was made by Chomwal on 20 September but the complaint was filed on 22 October. Why did the complainant wait for 32 days to file a complaint? Why did Vijay and his brother transfer Rs 2 lakh to Chomwal’s bank account and then file a complaint? Was it to create evidence? Well, the FIR says that they already had Chomwal’s WhatsApp calls and messages as evidence. Sonia’s lawyer said that she was regularly attending office between 20 September and 22 October, during the period when Chomwal was blackmailing Vijay. Her lawyer claimed that there would be enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage to prove her presence in the office. The question then is – why was she allowed to come to office when Vijay knew that she was one of the persons blackmailing him? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Sainath, a renowned journalist known for his ground reports that focus on the plight of the farmers, has been participating in protest marches organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). “The message behind this march is that people expect Parliament to work for the people and not just for the corporate world. When a special session of Parliament can be called for the rollout of GST, with virtually no notice, then why can’t one be called for the farmers’ issues,” he asks. He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 – and the last in 2006 – which means that “in 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.” We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. “Senseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,” Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers – both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously “the middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.” “Be it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,” he says.

Data from the   submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission of India (ECI) further substantiates this assumption. BJP was the beneficiary of 95 percent of the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. The electoral bonds scheme was notified in January 2018. March 2018 was the   when these bonds were available for purchase from four different branches of SBI (Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai & New Delhi).  using the Right to Information (RTI) revealed that a total of 520 electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were purchased in March 2018. Hence in the year 2017-18, these were the only bonds that were purchased. Most bonds (in terms of number) were purchased in Kolkata where 212 bonds were purchased. In terms of value, most bonds (worth Rs 122 crore) were purchased in Mumbai. As per the   submitted by the BJP to the ECI, the party received Rs 210 crore worth contribution in the form of electoral bonds.  This is a whopping 95 percent of all the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. Since the design of the scheme does not allow for the disclosure of names of the contributors, it is impossible to find out who contributed these Rs 210 crore to the BJP. Out of the total voluntary contribution of Rs 989.7 crore received by the BJP in 2017-18, more than 21 percent or Rs 210 crore is through electoral bonds. Even in terms of the total income of the BJP in 2017-18, more than 20 percent is through electoral bonds. 45 percent of BJP’s income in 2016-17 was from unknown sources as per  .

It also has to be noted that the Congress and NCP are the only two national parties that are yet to submit their annual audit report for 2017-18. It is possible that the rest of Rs 12 crore worth electoral bonds have gone to either the Congress or NCP or other state parties. It is also possible that a large part of these electoral bonds may not have gone to any party since   using RTI also revealed that bonds worth Rs 11 crore were not encashed by July 2018.  purchased in all the cycles till October 2018 clearly indicates that there is no demand for bonds of lower denomination. In terms of value, bonds of Rs 1 crore denomination accounted for Rs 782 crore or 89.6 percent followed by bonds of Rs 10 lakh denomination that accounted for Rs 89.6 crore or 10.3 percent. Together, they have accounted for close to 99.9 percent of total value of bonds purchased till date.

Sidhu, however, dismissed the reports and said that he does not know who is Gopal Chawla. “There were probably 10,000 pictures taken of and with me (in Pakistan), I don't know who Gopal Chawla is,” Sidhu told news agency ANI after returning to India. The controversy comes months after Sidhu was criticised for embracing Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa while the Punjab minister was attending the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Chawla, who heads the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, is a prominent pro-Khalistan voice. Earlier this month, he had provoked anger in India after he allegedly stopped Indian officials from visiting a gurudwara in Lahore to meet Sikh pilgrims from India. Chawla was a vocal propagator of ' ' that calls for the “liberation of Punjab.” Speaking to  , Security Analyst Praveen Swami said, “Chawla’s name had cropped up during the investigation of the grenade attack on the Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar, but there is no hard evidence against him.” Chawla is vocal about his pro-Khalistani stand on social media, and in a Facebook video, he can be heard saying, “Bharat is not Bharat, it has become Hindustan, which is why we need Khalistan.” He goes to praise Pakistan and raise anti-India slogans. Defending himself, Chawla told  Chawla also added that he clicked pictures with almost everybody present at the event. However, on being asked about the “terror activites” in Punjab, Chawla said, “We don’t support terror. Punjab is ours and why would we create disturbance in our own home?” On the sidelines of the ground-breaking ceremony, Chawla also met the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) President Gobind Singh Longowal. Speaking to the media, former Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab, Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “If Sidhu shakes hands with Gopal Chawla, who was involved in a terror attack in Pakistan, then he'll have to answer for it.” Badal also said that Sidhu doesn’t care about any protocol and that he should remember that the general he shook hands with “makes the youth of his country fight and die everyday.” Meanwhile, a Pakistani official clarified that the Pakistani Army Chief met all the guests at the Kartarpur ceremony venue and that the Indian media was taking a “myopic view” of the picture. The BJP, too, reacted sharply to Chawla's photo with Sidhu.

Singh said that Sidhu did not get back to him on the matter. Earlier in August 2018, when the Punjab Minister hugged Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa, on the sidelines of Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s swearing in, it created a furore, and the Punjab CM criticised Sidhu. The Punjab CM stated, that at a time when the Pakistan Army was killing Indian soldiers, Sidhu’s hug was uncalled for. Sidhu who left the BJP due to his strained ties with the Badal family has been far more aggressive on Sukhbir Singh Badal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, an ally of the BJP) and his brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia, a former Minister in the erstwhile SAD government. Sidhu sought the arrest of Majithia for his alleged links with drug peddlers (the Punjab minister stated that a special task force report set up by the Congress government had sufficient evidence, which pointed to Majithia’s involvement in drug peddling). The Punjab CM, who in his previous tenure went hammer and tongs against the Badals, has been less combative, with many, including his own party men, alleging that he has a tacit understanding with the Badals. Even when the Ranjit Singh Commission report (set up by Captain Amarinder Singh to investigate the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, as well as the death of two peaceful protesters who died as a result of police firing) was tabled in the Punjab assembly, Sidhu took a far stronger line against the Badals, arguing that the report stated that the former CM Parkash Singh Badal had issued firing orders. Captain Amarinder is being hailed for his decision to decline the Pakistani invitation for attending the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Sahib. Captain Singh has cited terrorism emanating from Pakistan, as well as the role of the Pakistani Army in the same as the reason for his decision. Elahi’s family is known for his proximity to the Pakistan Army as well as the ISI. Captain Singh visited Pakistan in 2005 and held the all Punjab games in December 2004. Significantly, during the 1980’s, the Elahi’s had links with a number of Khalistani activists and some analysts had criticised Captain Singh for going overboard in his outreach to Pakistani Punjab inspite of the above factors. Captain Amarinder Singh during his Pakistan visits has also cultivated strong personal friendships with individuals known to have close links with the Pakistani ‘Deep State’. The reasons for Captain Amarinder Singh’s decision to decline the Pakistani invitation thus are not driven solely by any principles or conviction. While Captain Singh’s decision and aggressive statements do no harm to burnish his nationalist credentials and his tough stance when it comes to national security, it is a bit naive to overlook other factors for Singh’s latest moves. One important factor could be that Navjot Singh Sidhu has stolen the limelight in the context of the Kartarpur issue.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals – why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of ‘tribal tourism’ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own ‘Ongan’ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an “Andaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute – ANTRI” in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to “hands off” to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed ‘Restricted Area Permit’ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands which  are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyone’s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

This is a curious call to action because, hopefully, the BJP and RSS know that no law can bypass the Constitution or judicial challenges in courts. And this law in particular – assuming the ruling party will have it passed in both houses of the Parliament – will most certainly be challenged in the Supreme Court. Unless the government seeks to build religious centres for all communities –which, given the political and ideological proclivities of the ruling dispensation, is unimaginable – the law to not only acquire the disputed land for a temple, but also to build it, would run into the headwinds of the constitutional guarantee of  . Gandhi and Sardar Patel supported the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, but not by the government and not by using state funds, despite the fact that the Somnath temple was not disputed in the way the Ram temple is. Secularism of the Indian state approximates more to proximity to all religions, rather than equal distance from all. The state is involved with a number of existing religious practices and institutions, but to pass a law that not only favours the faith of one community over another, but also legitimises retrospectively the assault committed on the faith of a minority community by the destruction of the Babri Masjid, would be to go too far beyond any possible definition of a secular state. We have been here before. The last time the government sought to acquire the land to settle the dispute between territories through the Acquisition of Central Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993, it took the matter (itself) to the Supreme Court in a reference, and declared before it, that it was committed “to the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque”, without specifying exact locations. The matter, at the heart of it, is a land dispute – a fact that is easy to forget in the political and ideological heat that surrounds it. (It is pertinent to remember that what was destroyed on 6 December 1992 was not only the Babri Masjid, but also the Ram Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi, whose existence is historically parallel to the Babri Mosque.) In  , the Supreme Court struck down the aforementioned 1993 Act saying that it was unconstitutional, as it overrode the property rights of the Muslim litigants, acquired according to the latter’s pleadings, through the simple fact that the Babri Masjid had stood on the disputed land at least since the 16th century. In addition, the government would also have to demonstrate that any such acquisition is in public interest – not an easy task, given that acquiring the land to build a Ram temple would favour one religion over another. If the government were to pass another such Act (this time with no proposal to build a mosque, presumably) it will also have to contend with the Places of Worship Act (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of any place of worship, including of course a mosque, as it existed on independence – a fairly fundamental safeguard for a secular state. Until that date, around when Muslims were forcibly stopped from using the mosque, Babri Masjid was a place of worship for the latter, barring the Ram Chabutra, which of course was a Hindu place of worship. It  also easy to forget that there is a criminal case winding its way through the judicial system given that it has been progressing at a pace that would put glaciers to shame. A law of the nature demanded by senior RSS leaders would only further abuse that the trust, and provide state approval and sanction to the demolition. If it comes into force, then the Supreme Court will have to answer if a criminal act can create property and other rights. Given the context, and our institutional and constitutional structure, it is baffling that the RSS is pushing the government to come up with a law to bypass the judiciary. The worst they can do is to keep mounting all kinds of pressure on the judiciary – including, for instance, the sort of vitriolic and personalised attack that Indresh Kumar launched on ‘2-3’ judges in a speech that he delivered on 27 November – and hope that the courts will buckle under pressure. But they cannot stop the law they are demanding from being brought to the courts, and challenged. Further delay means that the issue will remain emotive and eminently exploitable for elections to come but if the RSS’s real intent is to see a Ram temple built on the disputed land, a law passed by the government cannot help them bypass the judiciary. The only way to bypass the judiciary at first pass is to build the temple illegally, and the only way to bypass it altogether, is to change the Constitution to suit their end goal.

I donated it to those families of the farmers that committed suicide. While that went on for a number of years, I realised that the number of people I was benefitting was very small in proportion to the amount of distress there was. So I felt like, why not start a political movement! Something on a larger scale. Now, with the help of the district administration in UP, we identified such farmers and started crowd-funding in those areas. We worked with around 4,300 farmers across districts like Allahabad, Balrampur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur-Khiri. We were very particular about keeping the rate of recidivism low. It should not be like that a person takes the money, reduces or eliminates his debt, and goes on to spend it on his daughter’s marriage and gets back into debt again. This movement gave me a sense that we could see things to their logical conclusion. But again, this scale was very small. I realised that to effect a social transformation, we need to change things at the policy level because that’s the only way things are going to be systemically solved. That’s when I started working on this book. This book has taken me to 11 states, 60 districts to talk about things like water, labour, textile, energy access, agricultural marketing etc.” “You always find a very urban bias towards the fact that the farmer loan waivers have been given. If you look at total farm loan waivers in the country versus industry subsidies, the total farm loan waivers today are exactly 3.6% of the industry subsidies. When we are talking about people who are 70% of the total population, just 3.6%! So exactly which sops are we talking about? The conversation on agriculture these days is almost as if we are doing the farmers a favour, which is completely the other way round. A farmer doing a hectare of paddy or wheat farming earns about Rs 2,500-2,800 per month from that. An agricultural labourer earns about 5000 rupees a month. So a farmer is doing worse than the labour working on his field. How can it be sustainable? No wonder 30 million people in the last five years have left agriculture. 50 million people before that in the last ten years. That’s a lot of people. If it continues down this road, our food security will be threatened. My point is not simply about agriculture. My study is an academic critique of how the village as an economic unit can be viable a 100 years from now. Because if the village doesn’t remain viable then frankly India as a country is going to collapse. The cities cannot bear the burden of internal migration. We need to look at non-farm income, we need to look at textile, handicrafts. India has over 300 handicraft clusters. Why are we not ramping those up? In India one sustainable job in steel costs 24 lakh rupees; 24 jobs are created in textile for 1 lakh rupees. As a country, which one should we be looking at? We have an army of unemployed people, what are we doing?” “When Bombay Presidency was created, the British focused on irrigation in the southern Bombay Presidency, which is the present day Gujarat, and in western Maharashtra of today. But they did very little in what is now Vidarbha because it was largely seen as jungle. Now look at the consequence of something as basic as irrigation. The farmers of Vidarbha have 4% irrigation and they have been reduced to total pauperisation and this region sees the largest rate of farmer suicides in the country. The problems are there but the solutions are not terribly difficult.” “It’s not about the government only. It’s also about the channels in the middle. There is a historical study done in 1972 in then Calcutta, which said that just 2% of the end-user price of an orange reached the farmer because the marketing channels had consumed the majority of the value. Just look at our APMCs, the mandis. Unpaved roads, open spaces. Even today there are no storage facilities, there is no cover. A lot of stuff gets rotten. When you go there it’s almost like a mafia is running it. The farmers are at their mercy. The farmer goes there from his village 7-8 km away in a tractor trolley. Sometimes he stays there for 3-4 days awaiting good price. And then in desperation he sells at whatever price. Even if we do nothing else and just fix the mandis in our country that itself will alleviate and mitigate a lot of farmer distress. “These are very good solutions. Communication and information revolution will help the farmer. The point is, however, how many farmers have the smartphone? Even if they have smartphones they have cheap ones that don’t have enough battery power to run them. The electricity situation is not the best so their phones are not charged half the time. One of the projects that I undertook in Banda was with a group that was doing a lot of great work with information disseminated from Mandya in Karnataka via the mobile. Initially we took 4 villages in Banda and we started sharing this with them and we found that they were resistant. They said, “ ” But when I visited again after three months they were literally looking at their phones for one hour a day to educate themselves. Digital solutions will certainly work but please remember that in India we have gone from medievalism to post-modernism in a record period of time. So, we are living in, simultaneously, two different time zones.” “When talking about dairy, my mother takes the animal rights approach and I see it from purely economic perspective. Now a person engaged in dairy farming will eventually take the animal to the slaughterhouse after its milch phase is over because they can’t afford to keep them. What we need to look at is different systems to keep those creatures relevant for the farmer. In India, we have a desperate need for energy. When LPG cylinders—which are made from crude oil—spike in price they become unaffordable for the last man in society. So, if we can look at gobar gas plants many of our issues are solved. A bovine creature gives about 30-40 kgs of gobar everyday. If we can build localised gobar gas plants in every village and connect them to every house we’d have increased electricity, the tyranny of distance would be less and it would be cheaper. And those animals would always be relevant and therefore lead the life of some dignity.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

These were the words of the   when he promised to personally lead the global body towards greater gender equality. As the world observes the start of ‘16 Days of Activism’ against gender-based violence (from 26 November 2018), an independent United Nations system-wide survey on sexual harassment is taking place around all UN country offices. It is the first of its kind, and it demonstrates the UN’s resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all personnel across its offices. The UN initiative is in lock-step with the theme for this year’s ‘16 Days of Activism’ – ‘Orange the World; Hear Me Too’. The aim is to raise awareness about violence against women and its impact on a woman’s physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The #MeToo movement heralded the coming out of women across various professions and work forces, against their (primarily) male perpetrators, breaking a decades-old silence that they were previously compelled to live with. Statistics indicate that more than one in three women across the world have experienced physical or sexual violence, usually perpetrated by an intimate partner. In a   by Edison Research and Marketplace on sexual harassment, 27 percent of women and 14 percent of men reported that they had been harassed at some time at their workplace. Despite the progressive policy commitments and institutional frameworks on gender equality and women empowerment, implementation remains slow and inconsistent. While the   campaign has gained high momentum since its launch in September 2014, a lot still needs to be done to bring men on board in addressing sexual harassment towards women in public and private spaces. Such campaigns have brought considerable gains towards raising consciousness and self-assurance for women. Increasingly, they are speaking out against the indignities of work-related sexual advances and intimidation. This is the cost that countries are paying when women and girls are denied the chance to live to their full social and economic potential. Consider the aspect of employment: according to a World Bank   released this year, countries are losing USD 160 trillion in wealth because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men. This amounts to an average of USD 23,620 for each person. In India, reports indicate that every 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of domestic violence. In a country where physical and psychological abuse is all pervasive and rampant, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has done little to alleviate gender-based discrimination and violence. The Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office that has more than 10 employees of any gender. However, a   done some years back found that 7 in 10 working women did not report workplace harassment, demonstrating a disturbing lack of confidence in the system. By one  , gender inequality may have reduced India’s economic growth by almost 4 percent annually over the past 10 years. . It is estimated that 27 percent of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. It is said that the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25 percent increase in wages. In addition, ensuring that all girls get at least secondary education in India, would reduce child marriages by more than half. All these demonstrate the cyclical benefits, from one generation to the next, of education as an intervention strategy. However, while evidence abounds that parity with women is the best driving force for economic growth, wealth creation and poverty eradication, women’s rights are being “reduced, restricted and reversed”, according to UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres. There cannot be any illusions about the enormity of the task ahead. Misogyny is a deep-rooted expression of male entitlement that often excuses sexual harassment and violence, even at times by the survivors themselves. Women shouldn't have to feel 'grateful' for opportunities, says the UN DSG Amina Mohammed in a  . So true. Ultimately, countries need to begin breaking structural barriers, not just with gender equality as a lofty ideal but as a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. ’s (What does the first-time woman voter want?

This came a day after Chandramukhi’s mother, Anitha Muvvala, represented by lawyer Vasudha Nagraj, filed a habeas corpus writ petition in the Hyderabad High Court. Admitting the petition, the court had asked the Jubilee Hills police to produce Chandramukhi before them by 10:15 am on Thursday. Chandramukhi had reportedly been missing since 8:25 am on Tuesday, 27 November; based on the missing person's complaint, an FIR has been filed. The police said that they are reviewing CCTV footage. According to sources, Chandramukhi turned up at the Banjara Hills police station along with her lawyer and some activists late on Wednesday night. Speaking to TNM, Anitha confirmed that Chandramukhi had been found and was doing okay. She is expected to be produced at the court at 10 am. \"She has come back. She was abducted by someone and intimidated severely, she's dazed and disoriented. She'll share what happened to her before the court,\" Vasudha Nagaraj, her lawyer, told TNM. “She was noticed missing since 8:25 am and the door of her house is locked from the outside,” the Banjara Hills SHO said. Chandramukhi, a well-known face in Hyderabad’s trans community, is contesting from the Goshamahal constituency in Hyderabad on a Bahujan Left Front (BLF) ticket. She will be taking on bigwigs such as the BJP’s Raja Singh and the Congress’ Mukesh Goud. Vinu, who is tasked with the campaign schedule, told the press that Chandramukhi would inform him where she was going, and who she is meeting. “We approached the police only at 2:30 pm. We waited, hoping she would come back by then,” he said. Vinu also alleged that a person who was found lurking around her house in the CCTV footage could be involved in her disappearance.

In a candid interview with  , which was published on the day the state went to polls, on Wednesday, 28 November, Hluna said that from Modi to Shah, no national BJP leader had put in the slightest effort in the pre-election campaign.

According to Hluna, people in Mizoram – a predominantly Christian state – have in the past opposed the BJP, as they believe that the party would persecute Christians, should they be voted to power, the  report read. Despite this, Hluna told the news agency that he was fairly confident of the BJP bagging the highest number of seats in the Assembly elections, voting for which began on Wednesday, 28 November. He said the people wanted change and development, which the BJP could give them, the report added. Hluna told the news agency that he didn’t think that Modi, Shah and the party’s other central leaders had made enough of an effort for the pre-election campaign in Mizoram, as they had only sent one lawmaker and not visited any constituency themselves. He further said that since Hindi or English isn’t the first language of the Mizo people, the party’s central leadership did not have that much effect on them. Another point he brought up, was the lack of funds and lack of power that the state party was being given by its central leadership. “They should give us more money so that we can run things on our own. But there is no money, we are very poor. If there is a lot of money, we can do well,” he told  . To Hluna, the BJP’s greatest challenge to coming into power, was being perceived as a pro-Hindutva outfit, which would persecute those belonging to the Christian faith, the report stated. However, he added that it would be a Christian BJP candidate from Mizoram, who would come to power, if the BJP won the elections. Hence, he said, this is why people shouldn’t think against voting for the BJP, the report stated. Despite his problem with the central leadership of the BJP and the party’s “Hindutva” image in the state, Hluna told  that he was fairly confident and optimistic about its win in the elections. The reason, he said, was because people were fed up with the Congress rule under Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla and that they wanted change and development- which the state party under Narendra Modi’s guidance, would be able to give them.

He had supported the idea of joint polls before suddenly declaring early polls in Telangana and, as recently as August 2018, KCR had sent out indications that he is even open to a possible post-poll tie up with the BJP. But there seems to be a twist in that “friendly” tale with the BJP, and in the last three days, the Telangana campaign has been dominated by an acerbic  , in an exchange of statements and allegations. Hitting back at Modi, KCR, speaking at a rally in Mahbubnagar, alleged that the prime minister was “spreading lies for votes” and even referred to him as a “foolish” prime minister. He further stated that he was “not scared” of the prime minister like his political rivals. Firstly, KCR’s principal rival in the state is the Congress party and hence it is necessary for him to have a cordial equation with the BJP. Further, Telangana as a newly-formed state is heavily dependent on the Centre and hence, he needs a good equation with the prime minister. This population is not just centred around Hyderabad city where it even has a majority in some assembly seats, but is spread across the state and can be decisive in districts like Nizamabad or even KCR’s bastion Mahbubnagar. KCR and the TRS seem to have a friendly equation with the most powerful voice of the Muslims in the state, the All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, but there is no open alliance with the MIM and there are fears that Muslim voters may alienate the TRS as it is being seen as close to the BJP. There are also serious doubts over KCR’s gamble of calling for an early election. Ground reports indicate that the Congress has regrouped itself, and the alliance it has formed with the Telugu Desam Party, Left and the Telanagana Jana Samithi has formidable arithmetic on the ground. The combined vote share of the allies was nearly 40 percent in 2014 when the TRS managed to win just over half the seats with 34 percent vote share. The political dynamics seem to lend weight to the Congress’s allegation that the rivalry between KCR and the prime minister is ostensible. However, the fact that the TRS has an alliance with the MIM, which is formidable in Hyderabad, is a headache for the Congress. TRS leaders also point out that the TDP had an open alliance with the BJP before shifting sides, and hence, the Congress’s grand alliance (Maha Kootami as it is called in Telugu) is an alliance of opportunity and not one of values. But, in all this, what’s there for the BJP? Firstly, the Bharatiya Janata Party clearly hopes for a Congress defeat in Telangana. As a party, its stakes are minimal in the assembly polls, and hence, its ideal result would be a TRS win. However, in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP desperately needs allies in the south of India, and TRS is a potential candidate. But BJP leaders insist that they want to create an independent identity in the state and the prime minister targeting KCR is a message, that the party cannot be taken lightly by regional players. Finally, the nature of the attacks the two leaders made against each other was fierce and personal, and the language suggests that it needs to be taken seriously. But then, real life politics is stranger than fiction, and the sharper an exchange, the stronger the perception of being rivals!         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

That is why I closed that door. Those who want to speak ill of me, they can. But I am convinced that whatever I did was correct,” he said. He was addressing students of the ITM University. Confirming his remark, he said the push for Sajjad would have been justified as he has the numbers. “Whatever I said is right. Sajjad Lone has the numbers, obviously Delhi will push for him,” the governor told  . Malik has reinforced his allegations against Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) chief Omar Abdullah for not showing seriousness in forming the government. “If PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and NC leader Omar Abdullah were serious about forming a government (by joining hands) in Jammu and Kashmir, they should have rung me up, or sent me a letter” Governor Malik said. The governor said that he took the decision of dissolving the assembly without seeking any advice or direction or holding any discussion with Delhi. He clarified that as per the state Constitution, he did not have to take permission from the president or Parliament. \"I returned at 4 PM from Delhi and I got a briefing from intelligence officials about the situation. I found it needless to talk to Delhi, because two days ago I had met them all,” Governor Malik said. Reacting to the Governor’s speech in Madhya Pradesh, Omar Abdullah said in a tweet that he has never known a “politically appointed governor going against the wishes of the Centre”. However, minutes after the tweet, Abdullah tweeted congratulating the governor for “not looking to Delhi and for not taking their instructions.” Contrary to Malik’s move of dissolving the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the governor should have given the parties wanting to form the government a chance, instead of dissolving the Assembly. “He (Malik) has to defend himself in front of the government in Delhi, and you know what the government is all about. The Assembly should have seen who has the majority. It cannot be decided in the Raj Bhawan. Why didn’t they dissolve the Assembly earlier?” Abdullah told  . Malik’s comments come amid political turmoil in J&K and accusations of him being the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ‘puppet’. People’s Conference leader Sajjad Lone had staked claim on the formation of the Jammu and Kashmir government in alliance with the BJP after a coalition of People’s Democratic Party (PDP), National Conference (NC) and the Congress approached Malik to stake their claim. After the two coalitions approached Malik to form the government in the state, he elected to dissolve the state government. According to  , he said both the PDP and Sajjad had ‘no numbers’ to form the government as nobody among them came forward with their numbers. He added that if either side had managed to form government, it would have deteriorated the situation prevailing in the Valley for past several months. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

For a western mind hooked on the idea that all parts of the planet including the remote polar regions can be penetrated and conquered easily, the idea seemed preposterous – almost archaic – that a handful of men could kill an individual with just a bow and arrow. But here’s what the headlines are not telling you. This incident is in fact symptomatic of some of the broader changes being initiated on the island to overthrow a decades old ‘hands off’ policy, and open up the chain of islands like a box of chocolates for real estate and tourism sharks to bite into. Earlier, permission had to be taken for tourists to travel to these areas, most of which were off-limit in the past. And there are other plans afoot, courtesy a special committee appointed to review the current laws related to India’s coastline, that will introduce a slew of policy measures endangering not just the tribal islanders, but also stress the fragile ecology here. First, it’s important to understand why the islands are so special and why the Indian government followed a policy of protectionism in the past. Just 37 of the group of 572 islands, are permanently inhabited, by a mix of indigenous tribes and Indians (the latter were brought here as prisoners of the British, after the First War of Independence in 1857). The Nicobar Islands are home to two 'Mongloid' tribes – the Shompen and Nicobarese. The 'Negrito' tribes are believed to have arrived in the islands from Africa up to 60,000 years ago. All are nomadic hunter-gatherers, hunting wild pig and monitor lizard, and catching fish with bows and arrows. They also collect honey, roots and berries from the forest. Some of the Nicobarese people do some form of cultivation, and are also involved in what are considered ‘mainstream’ jobs. Each of these tribal groups have faced an onslaught from outsiders;  Great Andamanese for instance today number just 43. The tribe that has suffered most from contact with outsiders: 99 percent have been wiped out since the British first colonized the islands, the Onges number just 100 – their forest home has been plundered over the years by poachers and loggers. Then there is the Sentinelese, the ones that Chau sought to ‘befriend’ – their population estimated at 50-100. They are the most isolated of all the tribes – they have no peaceful contact with outsiders, and it is said – they fire warning arrows at those who approach. The islands also boast of a rich biodiversity. Of the 9,000 species recorded here, over a 1,000 are endemic, which means they are found just here and NOWHERE else in the world. A great example is the majestic Narcondam hornbill found on the island by the same name, the Andaman Day Gecko and the Andaman woodpecker. The islands themselves are considered a global biodiversity hotspot but threats are always looming large from ill-planned developers and commercial interests. Now take a look at the plans in store that will most certainly flatten out biodiversity as well as endanger the tribal groups here. The Draft Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2018 was introduced based on recommendations from the ‘Shailesh Nayak Committee’ report. This new draft permits the opening up of ecologically important inter-tidal zones, to destructive and polluting activities. A conglomerate of scientists and lawyers working on coastal issues wrote to the Environment Minister Dr Harshvardhan in October, red flagging some of the decisions being taken, along with sending a detailed critique to the policy makers. Sweeping changes have been made in the earlier law referred to as the Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2011, that now allows developers of shopping and housing complexes, hotels and entertainment complexes to walk in, thus diluting safeguards in place before. These are broad and open-ended phrases that are open to interpretation, thus opening the floodgates for the entry of many detrimental activities as ‘permissible’ ones. Another concern that has been red flagged by biologists is the arbitrary classification of ecologically sensitive areas. “Eco-tourism” activities have been allowed in the ecologically sensitive areas of what is referred to as ‘ICRZ I-A’- these include areas such as coral reefs, mangroves and sand dunes, which are not only ecologically sensitive, but are also critical for the survival of the islands as they buffer the islands against socio-ecological pressures and disasters. Many ecosystems such as rocky beaches, areas with high biodiversity, fish breeding and spawning areas etc. have been left out of this notification even though they are crucial for the islands. The Andaman and Nicobar and the Lakshadweep have unique geological history, and their coasts are influenced by a combination of tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric and ecological processes. Not only are they different from the coast of the mainland, they are also particularly fragile and vulnerable to climate change. The draft ICRZ notification 2018 does not take into account these particularities of the island ecosystem. Even habitats frequented by the critically endangered species like the sea cow or the Dugong has not been spared. Inter-tidal areas are also important feeding sites for dugongs, as they may contain sea grass species that are preferred. Dugongs are highly endangered species, with less than 50 individuals left in the Indian Ocean, and facing a rapid decline of population, and their conservation must be a priority. Disturbance of such areas through activities permitted above or accidents such as oil spills may be the death knell for these animals and may lead to local extinction. Biologists working on the islands have urged that the protective safeguards in the 2011 Notification should be retained. With these sweeping changes being introduced in government policy, the ethereal beauty and uniqueness of the Andaman and Nicobar islands could be lost forever. It is but sad that the Sentinelese had to take it upon them to protect their island. In this day when social media is the beast, this ‘primitive’ tribal group has managed, with just a bow and arrow, to send a message to the entire world – leave our land and forest alone.

The torpedoing of Manafort's plea deal, disclosed in  on Monday, 26 November, also results in special counsel Robert Mueller's team losing a cooperating witness from the top of Donald Trump's presidential campaign who was present for several key episodes under investigation. That includes a Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer he was told had derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton. The move signals a return to the acrimonious relationship Manafort has had with the special counsel's office since his indictment last year. Before his plea agreement, Manafort aggressively challenged the special counsel's legitimacy in court, went through a bitter trial and landed himself in jail after prosecutors discovered he had attempted to tamper with witnesses in his case. Prosecutors said they will detail the \"nature of the defendant's crimes and lies\" in writing at a later date to the judge. Through his attorneys, Manafort denied lying, saying he \"believes he provided truthful information\" during a series of sessions with Mueller's investigators. He also disagreed that he breached his plea agreement. Still, both sides now agree they can't resolve the conflict, and US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson should set a date to sentence him. Manafort, who remains jailed, had been meeting with the special counsel's office since he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He cut that deal to head off a second trial after being convicted last summer of eight felony counts related to millions of dollars he hid from the IRS in offshore accounts. Both cases stemmed from his Ukrainian political work and undisclosed lobbying work he admitted to carrying out in the US in violation of federal law. As part of his plea agreement, Manafort pledged to “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly” with the government “in any and all matters” prosecutors deemed necessary. That included his work on the Trump campaign as well as his Ukrainian political work, which remains under investigation by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors there are   the conduct of longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and former Republican congressman and lobbyist Vin Weber to determine whether they violated federal law by failing to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. None of the men has been charged with any crimes. But with prosecutors saying he breached the agreement, Manafort now faces serious repercussions such as the possibility of prosecution on additional charges including the 10 felony counts prosecutors dropped when he made the deal. Manafort already faces up to five years in prison on the two charges in his plea agreement. In his separate Virginia case, Manafort's potential sentencing under federal guidelines has not yet been calculated, but prosecutors have previously said he could face as much as 10 years in prison on those charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in that case in February. His co-defendant Rick Gates, who spent a longer time on the campaign and worked on the Trump inaugural committee, has not had a sentencing date set yet. He continues to cooperate with Mueller.

When she was born, India was under British occupation and World War 1 had just concluded. You might say, look at how the imagination of the world has changed in this time. Gandhi was only just getting his non-cooperation movement started. People in her part of the world in rural Maharashtra didn’t have bicycles or electricity or cameras. She would tell you, in these hundred years, what has altered most significantly is this: When she was a child, if you grew food, it was an absolute guarantee you would not starve. Now, in 2018, if you are a farmer, it is almost certain you will. And so, it is that at the age of one hundred that she walked from her village Baradi in Nandurbar district for ten kilometres to get to the nearest town from where she got into a shared taxi. From there to the train in the next town, and then another train, and after nearly twenty hours of continuous and taxing travel, she arrived in Mumbai, to join thousands of protesting farmers demanding many things, but essentially one thing — the right to live. It’s ridiculous that they grow food for the rest of the country to eat but are so consumed by debt from crop failure and no means to buy expensive fertilizer or even more expensive diesel for their tractors. “Enough is enough,” Jijabai and many others from her village said. This year has been a particularly bad crop in her district. The yield was half what it was from last year. Her children and grand-children all work as daily wagers on other farms and on road and building projects and still it’s hard to find enough to eat. Things are in fact so impossible that Jijabai decided to put herself and her tired body though this agonizing journey to make her voice count. Even though she was just a speck – one of the thousands of people to have arrived at Mumbai’s Azan Maidan on 21 November, ahead of the long march to Delhi – she considered it vital enough for her to be there. On that day, Sachinbhai — a leader from the Lok Sangharsh Morcha in Maharasthra said Jijabai woke up at 4 am with the others. And since the participation was entirely voluntary, most people, including Jijabai didn’t have anything to eat all day. She had her first cup of chai after noon. But there was fire in her belly. With the system weighed so heavily against them, farmers across the country are preparing to be in Delhi’s Ramlila maidan on 29 and 30 November, demanding that a special session of parliament be convened to raise crucial survival issues. Her voice was barely audible after a day at the rally. “Sorry, I’ve lost my voice,” she said, apologetic, but happy to see the issue get some traction. At the other end of the country, K Balakrishnan from the ‘Jai Kisan Andolan’ and Convener of the Tamil Nadu farmers’ agitation, said even rich farmers are in distress with cyclone Gaja having destroyed their crop. This is why crop insurance, the guarantee of a minimum support price from the state, and the allotment of land promised to tribals is crucial, he explained. And in the case of farmers reeling from the effects of the cyclone, compensation that hasn’t still been given. Ramesh Chander from Jind in Haryana, echoes these sentiments. He also added that this government has been particularly harsh on farmers. Until 2014, there was at least a minimum guarantee of 50-55 days of daily wages under the MNREGA scheme. Now, in the non-agricultural season, there is no guarantee of getting daily wage work. And the supplementary income from the sale of cattle once it’s past its prime has stopped, thanks to the cow vigilante groups, he added. “The rate of purchase of milk has dropped and I can’t sell my buffalo either,” Chander lamented. Adding that farmers groups – 200 of them were also being strategic in the timing of their agitation. “Yeh election ka saal hai, this is an election season.” He’s lost 30,000 rupees this agricultural season, and if he doesn’t join the tidal wave of voices now, it will be a big opportunity lost. His survival could be at stake. Avik Saha, Organising Secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination group or the AIKSCC summed it up in a catch-phrase he has coined for the march – “Modi Ko Harao, Rahul Ko Darao” (Remove Modi, Scare Rahul). “Our job,” he clarified, “is to make it impossible to ignore farmers.” The politics of the movement is absolutely transparent. They would like to build pressure on the Modi government at a time when they are aware it is facing the heat on every front. And they would like to extract these basic promises ahead of the 2019 elections. The long-term goal is to build the 200 farmers groups that have signed on into a collective block. Lingraj, a farmers’ activist from Odisha, said his organisation doesn’t have money. So about a thousand farmers from that state will travel by train, unreserved. “You can classify the farmers by the routes they take from different parts of the country,” Avik Saha remarked. Farmers from Bihar and Odisha can only travel unreserved, but in Karnataka, there are some who will be flying in. For now, they have nothing to hold onto but their dissent. Farming is all that Jijabai knows. At a hundred plus years, she would like to be able to hold on to that one basic thing – the right to grow food and for it to be sustainable.  ‘     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Forget Indians who had not voted for Modi; since August 2017, as dissatisfaction triggered by the slapdash roll-out of GST grew, it became evident – borne out repeatedly by election verdicts since the Gujarat result – that even large sections of those who   for him were no longer backing him. This sense deepened in June after Mehbooba Mufti resigned, following which BJP pulled out of the coalition and withdrew support to the PDP. The dissolution of the State Assembly last week has further pushed BJP to its core agenda. To understand, there is need to analyse what Modi jettisoned in March 2015 when he and BJP president Amit Shah were in attendance, when Mufti Mohammed Sayeed took oath as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir along with BJP's Nirmal Singh as Deputy Chief Minister, besides other 23 other ministers from the two parties. It was a courageous decision to align with the PDP. To do so, Modi had to silence the slogan which served as his party's clarion call on J&K for 62 years since 1953. The slogan was coined by the party in memory of its iconic founder president, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, after he died in June 1953 in Srinagar jail where he was detained for forcibly entering the state despite orders to the contrary: (The Kashmir where Mookerjee laid down his life, is ours) Neither was the air rent with this emotional slogan to convey sense of satisfaction of being in power in a 'lost' state – albeit in a coalition – nor did any of the party leaders or cadre give voice to what they have grown up with – Mookerjee's slogan, or the rhyme, he shouted along with party activists, including 29-year-old Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in the course of his agitation on Kashmir: (In one country, there cannot be two constitutions, two heads and two flags) Since Mookerjee's death, abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution which grants autonomous status to the state along with a separate Constitution, was one of the three contentious issues that was the BJP's hallmark, contributing to its claim of being a party with a difference. But post 2014, with the BJP having a majority of its own and not being dependent on coalition partners, this response would not have sounded convincing. This was especially true because the BJP did not dilute its posture on the other two disruptive demands: construction of Ram temple and introduction of Uniform Civil Code. The formation of the coalition was not billed as evidence of majoritarian triumph in the only Muslim-majority state, despite this having been the stated objective since the Jana Sangh days. Each of BJP's 25 seats were located in predominantly Hindu-majority seats of the Jammu region. The BJP had mounted an audacious Mission 44+ campaign for the 2014 Assembly polls. Despite this acrimonious campaign, its decision to align with the PDP indicated a visible departure from Mookerjee's and BJP's past visions of the state’s relationship with the rest of India. Modi realised that as the national helmsman, he had to view challenges in the state beyond what the party was accustomed to. In utterances, Modi and colleagues indicated the necessity to leave behind the 3Cs – conflict, contradictions, cynicism. Instead, they had to follow just one mantra: R – reboot or reconciliation. Clearly, the party realised that to resolve conflict, dialogue and joint action were the only ways to reinforce the region's pluralistic heritage and extricate itself from the quagmire it has been trapped in for decades. Yet, Modi squandered the chance of securing the love and affection of the Kashmiris like Vajpayee did. His reiteration of Insaniyat (Humanism), Jamhooriyat (Democracy) and Kashmiriyat (Kashmir's age-old legacy of Hindu-Muslim amity) rang hollow because the Centre faltered on every pledge it made, the worst being the lack of urgency on the flood rehabilitation package. The situation worsened after the generational transition in PDP following Mufti's death. From April 2016, when Mehbooba Mufti became chief minister, the BJP's engagement in J&K was not with an eye on ushering normalcy into the state. There is little doubt that the BJP faces an uphill battle in 2019 and this cannot be won on the basis of this government's performance. To prevent the parliamentary hustings being reduced to a state-wise aggregation of polls, the BJP requires a set of emotive issues. This plank has been under construction for the past several months. The majoritarian platform contain several elements – Ram temple, fresh confrontation in  , renaming of cities and towns, continuing campaigns for cow protection and against Love Jihad, and so on. The BJP's latest tactics on Kashmir and its declaration that the state requires no special treatment coupled with the continuing tough posture on Pakistan completes the bouquet of Hindutva-centric issues with which the BJP will approach the electorate. As far as Kashmir is concerned, there is now little to differentiate between the sentiment of the fringe that supports BJP and the party's mainstream. The BJP's promise of a paradigm shift is now a mirage. In the hope of consolidating Hindus to vote on the basis of their religious identity, he has lost the support of those who considered him a pragmatist and not a committed ideologue. The wheel has come full circle for Modi, and also for J&K. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The attack carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives from Pakistan went on for four days, starting on 26 November, and left over 160 people dead. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was caught alive, and revealed in subsequent investigations how the LeT planned, organised and executed the deadly act. Ten men had arrived from Pakistan via sea, disembarking from Karachi city, and landing on a beach in Mumbai. The Indian authorities hanged Kasab, the lone survivor of the attack in 2012. The Americans also caught another person involved in the attacks, David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-origin American, who confessed that he had done reconnaissance missions in Mumbai prior to the attacks, and had shared this information with those organising the attacks. Headley is currently serving a 35-year sentence in an American prison. On paper, LeT is banned in Pakistan since 2002, but it operates under different names today in the country and continues to find recruits, carry out cross-border terrorism from Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and expand its footprint in Pakistan without much hindrance. Lakhvi is said to be in charge of LeT in Pakistan and is a close associate of Hafiz Saeed, who founded LeT in the late eighties. Hafiz Saeed publicly disassociated himself from LeT and launched Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), which he professes is a charity organisation. However, both local and international authorities believe JuD is a front for LeT. The United States has even offered a $10 million reward for information that can lead to Saeed’s conviction for the Mumbai attacks. Post 26/11, JuD came under international scrutiny too and was designated a global terrorist group by the United Nations. Following this, Pakistan also took some cosmetic measures against it; but the group once again relaunched under a new name called Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation. Even that has been exposed and since then it is suspected to have come up with another new name called Tehreek-e-Azadi Jammu and Kashmir. Many point to its linkages with the Pakistan military. It is suspected that LeT enjoys support from the so-called parallel shadow government, and the real policy makers of the country: the Pakistan Army. Therefore, evidences against the group are rare to come by, and there is very little that the civilian authorities can do, even if they want to take action against the group. In 2015, Tariq Khosa, the former head of Pakistan’s leading civilian law enforcement agency called the Federal Investigation Authority, wrote how there was enough evidence that his organisation had uncovered against the LeT operating from a camp near the city of Karachi. Despite that, no one in Pakistan has been convicted to date in the Mumbai attacks trials, which continue to linger on without any meaningful progress for the last nine years. In an interview this year, when Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif posed a question to the reporter asking why the Mumbai attack trials had not concluded and why militants were being allowed to cross the border and kill people, Pakistani courts initiated a treason case against the former premier and the journalist who published the interview, for defaming national institutions. Observers say it is to serve the strategic foreign policy purposes of the Pakistani military which wants to keep the Kashmir conflict militarised, so that the Armed Forces’ relevance and dominance in Pakistan continues to remain unchallenged – because as long as there is a conflict with the next-door neighbour, the Pakistan army will be able to justify its budgets, its interference in political matters and its human rights abuses in the name of security. Recently, the military has also started using the LeT’s charity wing, JuD, for domestic political purposes. The JuD launched the Milli Muslim League (MML), and its backed candidates contested the recent general elections. While a former military general alluded that the group was introduced to politics to mainstream militants, the real reason many believe they were introduced in Punjab, Pakistan is to dent the vote bank of the last ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz faction (PMLN). The military believes the PMLN is harmful for its interests as it wants to normalise relations with India. But it is not just state support the LeT seems to enjoy in Pakistan. The group also seems to enjoy popularity among the population, partly because it can operate freely in many parts of the country, but mainly because these regions are areas where vulnerable Pakistanis are looking for subsistence, given lack of income, and at times, due to circumstances that have forced them to look for help. Also, the local Pakistani media reports on the movement favourably, projecting it as a welfare organisation. I have followed the group closely during my reporting missions in the country and have seen how they run a strong network of charity organisations. In one such reporting trip to South Punjab, I saw Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, one of the fronts of LeT, helping out the flood-affected by bringing them food and providing them shelter. When I asked one of the organisers about their motive behind the help, the organiser told me it was to find recruits among this population for their movement, adding how many households in such rural populations had large families, with too many children. When I had first learnt of how they were brainwashing youngsters in this manner, I had mentioned it to a serving Pakistani military intelligence official that I knew as a source. But this policy of allowing “external-looking” militancy to continue to exist has come back to haunt the country. In recent times, many former LeT operatives have joined other terrorist organisations like the ISIS, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi etc, and now consider Pakistan a target too and have carried out terror attacks on Pakistani soil. Pakistan’s policy makers must realise that by allowing such groups to continue operating in the country and thinking the country will remain safe from them is not the way forward. The Pakistani military repeatedly says it is committed to fighting terrorism and bringing peace. But if that is true, one of the right steps in that direction should include an actual crackdown against groups like the LeT. To start with, Pakistan should punish those involved in the Mumbai attacks and then also dismantle its infrastructure in the country. Otherwise, its commitment to peace in the South Asian region looks doubtful. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

LJP parliamentary board chair Chirag Paswan accused the RLSP chief and Union minister Upendra Kushwaha of rowing in two boats and using pressure tactics to finalise a seat-sharing arrangement between the NDA partners in Bihar by Friday. \"By setting a deadline and taking a stand that he will not talk to anybody except the prime minister, he (Kushwaha) is taking recourse to pressure tactics. Besides, he keeps on speaking against the chief minister. You cannot go on speaking against the NDA constituents while being in the coalition. It is like rowing in two boats,\" Chirag said. Reacting to the young LJP leader's statement, RLSP general secretary Madhaw Anand said the party had been following the coalition dharma ever since they became a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), adding that it needed no lessons from Chirag or his father and LJP president, Ram Vilas Paswan. He made it clear that the RLSP would continue to raise any issue it deemed to be in the interest of the state, irrespective of whether the party was in the NDA or not. \"We do not wish to waste much time on the opinions the other NDA constituents express about us. At present, we are busy with the preparations for our rally in East Champaran on 6 December when Kushwaha would sound the poll bugle for the party,\" Anand added. Kushwaha, a former Janata Dal (United) leader, had floated the RLSP in 2013 and contested the 2014 Lok Sabha poll as an NDA ally, bagging all the three seats it had contested. On the JDU's return to the NDA last year, it was being speculated that the development would upset leaders like Kushwaha and former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha founder Jitan Ram Manjhi, both of whom had burnt their bridges with Kumar. Manjhi had quit the NDA earlier this year, ahead of elections to the Legislative Council, where he secured a berth for his son with the help of the RJD-Congress combine. It was seen as a rebuff to Kushwaha whose party has been demanding a greater share than the JDU, since the RLSP chief belonged to the Koeri caste, which is much more sizeable than Kumar's Kurmi community. Kushwaha's high pitch on the seat-sharing issues has brought him in confrontation with the JDU initially.

Meet Yunus Khan. Khan is a minister in the current Vasundhara Raje Cabinet and has filed his nomination from Tonk Assembly seat. Why is this seat crucial? Because this is the seat where Congress has fielded perhaps their most popular leader of the state, Sachin Pilot. Speaking exclusively to  , Khan answered the questions on Muslim representation in BJP, development policies and Sachin Pilot.  Why were you, an outsider, offered a ticket from Tonk and not the incumbent MLA? All of us are mere workers of the BJP. We have worked as the servants of the people. In the last 5 years, I was responsible for the construction of roads across Rajasthan and the bus transport service. I have visited every corner of the state. Even in Tonk, we constructed roads in all 36 Gram Panchayats. We also provided them national and state highways. So it’s unfair to reduce me to a constituency and call Sachin Pilot a state-wide leader. I entered politics before him. I have worked for this state. It’s okay if he has a tag of state president but I have also served the people in Rajasthan.   Has BJP made you the sacrificial lamb? These are the words of media. I don’t want to comment on it. But, what I will tell you is that on 11 December, the public and BJP workers will show you who is sacrificed and who is the lamb.     But Sachin Pilot is a big Congress leader. Also, Tonk has a significant number of Muslim voters and hence the BJP has fielded you.  I agree that Sachin Pilot has become a taller leader than Ashok Gehlot. I have been campaigning in Tonk. I don’t think that a big face alone will be of much help. This election is between a public servant and a master. I think Tonk’s voters will elect a public servant.   What do you mean when you say ‘master and servant’? I use these terms because Sachin Pilot is the chief of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC). He himself chose to contest from this seat because candidates in Congress are handpicked by Sachin Pilot and his friend Rahul Gandhi. And I call myself a servant because I have served the people of Tonk and Rajasthan. We have ensured that villages are connected to a road. He (Pilot) was an MP and a minister for 10 years and he never paid any attention to the people of Tonk. On the other hand, in all the 170 villages you will find a road constructed, which was commissioned by me.   PM Modi talks about ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ but BJP gives a ticket to just one Muslim candidate in 200 seats.   When a road is constructed or when water connection is provided, then all castes and religions avail the benefits. What about representation from that community?  Every party has its own political reasoning on who to give a ticket to and who not to. Tickets are not distributed on the basis of caste or religion. It depends on how much a person believes in the party’s ideology. I am connected to BJP’s ideology. I am a dedicated party worker. Hence, I am provided with the ticket. If someone else also works for the party then they too will be provided with the ticket.   Will you contest elections on national issues or local issues?   I am not a national leader and hence, I will not go into the national issues. The biggest local issue here is employment and how to create more employment. New industries need to be set up so that more jobs are created. New projects should be announced. These will be my issues. But you were in power for 5 years. Then why is unemployment an issue? Those who have ruined the state and this country for 55 years don’t have the right to demand our 5-year report card. But we will provide a report card. We did provide employment opportunities. We provided 3.25 lakh government jobs. Approximately 18 lakh were employed in private and other sectors. Around 45 lakh were given Mudra loans. So we have provided job opportunities and we want to do more. We are fighting on these issues. We want to increase the pace of development. Otherwise, whenever Congress has come to power, the speed of development has been reduced. We are working to ensure uninterrupted development.   How many seats will the BJP win? BJP will get an absolute majority under the leadership of Vasundhara Raje.   But no one is saying what number of seats. We will win as many seats as we won the last time. Are you feeling the pressure of this high-profile contest?   There is pressure. But not on me. It’s on him who you are calling a stalwart Congress leader.  But surveys show that BJP is trailing. We will talk about it on 11 December at 11 am about who is under pressure, who is the sacrificial lamb and who the surveys support. And we won’t, but TV channels across the world will say that history has been created in Tonk. This election is between Sachin Pilot and the voters of Tonk & BJP workers. This election isn’t about Yunus Khan. If we lose, then it’s my loss but if we win, it will be the victory of Tonk.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

To understand its social media presence, I had to plunge headlong into a strikingly   world, powered by the holy trinity of Ram, Hanuman, and  , and united by anti-Islamic sentiment. Here’s what I found. If I was Hindutva army’s online warrior, where would I be and how would I communicate? I would need a point of convergence, a way of appeal... and what better way than the mighty hashtag? If you search the hashtag #JaiShriRam (or some version of it) on Twitter and Instagram, you come across something like this: You also come across something like this: Both these posts are by an Instagram account called ‘ ’ which (at the time of writing this) has more than 50k followers. The posts, which appear quite simple at first, are works of carefully crafted genius. In the heyday of   politics and the growing demand for building the  , such posts are not simply memes or Hindutva trolling, but can have far-reaching consequences, especially on the impending elections. On Saturday, 24 November, the UP government under Yogi Adityanath reportedly announced the finalising of the details for a 221-metre tall  . When the news broke out, the hashtag #MandirWahinBanayenge immediately started trending on Twitter. Other reasons for the trending hashtag were two separate events, including a Dharam Sabha, organised by Shiv Sena and VHP in Ayodhya. Simultaneously, PM Modi also made a reference to the ‘ ’ while addressing a rally in Alwar, Rajasthan. These verses could put our most beloved Insta Poets to shame. The Hindutva poetic verses also tie up nicely with Hindutva pop songs, which add dub-step music to the lyrics for added effect. Sample this badly dubstep-ed Eminem version of  : Why I term this combination ‘deadly’ is because beside the title of the song, the lyrics too have subtle hints of violence. Talking of ‘deadly’... If you’re looking for some badly edited green-screen videos, but unedited  , check out Sanjay Faizabadi’s song  . Note how Faizabadi is dressed in army attire with visuals of fighter planes, bombing, and gun-violence in the background. Unlike the Eminem version of  , violence here is more obviously hinted at. These ‘catchy’ songs make their way to parties, attracting the young, while the Instagram and Twitter posts also make their way into our parents’ and grandparents’ WhatsApp inboxes. And if you have any doubts about the political bent of these visuals and songs, just think: the pages churning out this content are named using a permutation and combination of ‘Hindu’, ‘Hind’, ‘Swarajya’, ‘Sena’, ‘Ram’, ‘Raj’, and ‘Saamrajya’.

Which army teaches to violate ceasefire and kill jawans on the other side? Which army teaches to send people to attack Pathankot and Amritsar? This is cowardliness,” said Singh. Singh was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor to connect the Dera Baba Nanak Gurudwara in Gurdaspur to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur across the LoC in Pakistan’s Punjab. Vice President of India M Venkaiah Naidu, along with Singh, laid the foundation stone for the corridor. Union Ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Nitin Gadkari were also present. Backing Singh’s comments, Naidu said killing of innocent people will not be tolerated. “I must tell what Punjab CM said, that we can't allow terrorism and can't let innocents die, this isn't going to help, it's not the way; it must be understood. That’s why, let this be the start of this great event,” he said. Singh on Sunday had declined Pakistan's invite to attend the ground-breaking ceremony for the Kartarpur Corridor on the other side of the border, even as his cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu accepted the request. In a letter to Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Singh said though it was a historic occasion, he regretted his inability to be present, citing terror attacks in his state and killings of Indian soldiers by Pakistan troops as the reason. Secondly, the chief minister had claimed that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has started its nefarious activities in Punjab. \"Since March 2017, the state has neutralised 19 ISI-armed and controlled modules, apprehended 81 terrorists and seized 79 weapons, numerous grenades of the HG-84 type made in Pakistan's Ordnance factories with Austrian know how, and some IEDs,\" the chief minister claimed. The last attack took place in Amritsar few days ago, on a peaceful religious congregation in a village. Three people were killed and 19, including children, were wounded, Singh said, adding that the terrorists had been caught. \"I hope that the (Pakistan) prime minister will understand the circumstances... It will not be possible for me to be present in Pakistan on this historic occasion, despite the fact that paying my respects at Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib has always been my cherished dream which will hopefully be fulfilled once these hostilities and killings are stopped,\" he said. Thanking Qureshi for the invitation, Singh recalled his visit to Pakistan as Punjab chief minister in the past. \"As you will see from the stone laid at the Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, it was my grandfather Maharaja Bhupindra Singh who carried out flood protection measures from 1920 to 1929 to protect our gurdwara which was being ravaged by floods in river Ravi each year,\" Singh wrote in the letter. Singh expressed hope that the Pakistan prime minister \"will do all he can to bring the two countries together on the road to peace and friendship.\" (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Several alumni of Symbiosis Law School have told  that they have not yet received Letters of Recommendation (LoR) from the college, despite having applied for the same as per the college’s prescribed procedure. Most, if not all foreign universities of repute require a Letter of Recommendation from a professor who has taught a student during their time in college. Some foreign universities even require two LoRs from the university the student graduated from. They also claimed that many others had also been refused Letters of Recommendation. None of these refusals were made over official communication channels. They were either communicated over the phone, in person, or in some instances, Whatsapp (screengrabs of the same are in  ’s possession). Now, the standard procedure for seeking a Letter of Recommendation from Symbiosis Law School can be found on the   of Symbiosis Law School, Pune. Here’s a screenshot for quick reference. Other students of Symbiosis Law School told  that getting a physical Letter of Recommendation from the college usually takes around two weeks. However, an online LoR doesn’t require the same time. It’s a form sent to the professor in question, and the professor fills out the same and reverts. The first letter was sent to the College’s Chancellor and Vice Chancellor on 30 October, and the second to the Registrar of Symbiosis International Deemed University on 8 November. The subject of both letters was the alumni's concern over the incident of college/hostel authorities   of Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, Apoorva Yarabahalli and Snigdha Jayakrishnan from their college hostel rooms on 26 October, and the Director of Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Shashikala Gurpur reportedly verbally threatening them with rustication. Additionally, the alumni’s letters also asked the administration how CCTV footage of the two girls arguing with the college hostel’s authorities taken from the hostel’s CCTV cameras, also mysteriously found its way onto the internet. Symbiosis International University’s registrar, Dr MS Shejul replied to the first letter on 31 October, stating that disciplinary action was taken against the two girls as part of procedure. The reply added that the college couldn’t comment on the video because the video, which contained footage from the Symbiosis Law School Hyderabad hostel CCTV, wasn’t “sent officially” by the University. At the time of writing this piece, the college has not officially replied to the second letter sent by the alumni on 8 November. Now to be clear, the college has not officially denied or refused students a letter of recommendation. However, the students allege that through unofficial channels, the director of Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Shashikala Gurpur refused Letters of Recommendation. In one exchange on Whatsapp, when the student asked Dr Gurpur (the phone number in question has been verified by  ) about her letter of recommendation, after completing the required procedure, Dr Shashikala Gurpur told the former student that they can’t issue LoRs to students who don’t have faith in the college. The students say, in the Whatsapp exchange, Dr Gurpur refers to the letter sent by the students expressing concern about the college’s action against Apoorva and Snigdha, and refuses to provide the college’s support to students who signed the letter sent to them. Now, remember, this wasn’t over an official channel, but Whatsapp. So, the college hasn’t outright refused or denied an LoR officially. They just haven’t provided one yet. Other students who signed the letters told  that they had written to professors at the college for an LoR, who initially agreed to provide the letters, but were informed later that they needed to get permission from the director, Shashikala Gurpur “according to a new circular.” On 24 November, the college told several alumni to reply from their individual email IDs to the college, CCing the person who sent the original letter, explaining that they were rescinding support to the letter. has mailed a questionnaire to Symbiosis Law School’s director and others concerned. When this reporter reached out to Shashikala Gurpur for a statement after the mail, she replied, “I don’t know you” and hung up. With few options left, and with deadlines for their foreign university and Masters’ degree applications fast approaching, many former students are now faced with a tough choice.

He is an audacious and energetic propagator of his pet ideas. And he coins really smart acronyms to catch the popular imagination. That was apparent when he celebrated India’s leap of 23 spots, from rank 100 to 77, in the EODB (Ease of Doing Business) Index compiled by the World Bank. Modi beamed. He was now tantalizingly close to his target of “getting India into the Top 50”, so you could not grudge him the joy. “Now our effort is to take India to the five-trillion-dollar club as soon as possible”. Several other things were left unsaid too. Most of us assume, quite innocently, that the World Bank’s EODB Index is the gold standard of economic performance. In reality, it’s an extremely narrow, even misleading, summation of a few economic rules which matter to a tiny,  , sliver of India’s vast population. Here are a few eye-opening (popping?) facts: Even more critical is to check what the EODB Index does   take into account (you will be now astonished to see how lethally narrow its underpinning is): Prime Minister Modi’s older echo chamber, the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), had given a dire warning just two days ahead (on 16 November 2018) of his euphoric EODB outing. Although Modi, in another virtuoso act, remained silent on their prophecies of doom (which I am quoting verbatim): But the Gujarat warning was drowned in the EODB din, as Modi conjured up yet another big sounding theme. He announced a “Grand Challenge” for India’s techies to come up with smart ideas in “artificial intelligence, the internet of things, big data analytics and block-chain technologies to streamline and speed up processes”, that would catapult India into the Top 50. He used all the fancy tech terms in vogue to talk up his newest “brain wave”. Two years ago, the income tax department had issued similar notices, slapped taxes, and begun prosecution under the dreaded “angle tax” provisions. It’s an outrageous levy, which places the power to “value” start-ups in the hands of clueless inspectors. Imagine, even the most successful professionals, from private equity and venture capital outfits, get valuations right  . Because valuations, like beauty, lie in the eyes of the beholder! For example, if five investors had valued Flipkart at USD 1 bn, USD 2 bn, USD 3 bn, USD10 bn or USD 15 bn in 2012, who would have been right, and who wrong? Clearly, each person’s valuation would depend on her: Each person would have given different weights to these individual factors, and arrived at any number of different valuations. And each would have been right, because Flipkart was eventually sold for USD 20 bn in 2018. Do you seriously think any of our hypothetical investors would have put money under such a tax regime, where they were being coerced to pay cash taxes on unrealised/uncertain “profits”? Clearly, this tax is a travesty, and tragedy, inflicted on Indian start-ups by Prime Minister Modi. It’s an astonishing repudiation of Stand-up India, Start-up India, Digital India, Make In India and God knows how many more schemes. So, even as Prime Minister Modi got “India Shining” bouquets from his Mumbai/Delhi echo chamber on EODB (Ease of Doing Business), his Gujarati kinsmen and India’s first generation founders, if he had cared to speak to them, would have given a very different “India Taxing” brickbat: Egregious Officers Destroying Business, ie, EODB!

The first, that not a day passes without Pakistani forces attacking Indian positions in Jammu and Kashmir, and the second, that the Pakistani spy agency Inter-Service Intelligence or ISI is trying to create trouble in Punjab. \"The last attack was in Amritsar last Sunday, on a peaceful religious congregation in one of our villages, in which three men were killed and 19, including women and children, were wounded,\" Captain Amarinder said. \"I hope the Prime Minister (Imran Khan) will understand that under these circumstances, it will not be possible for me to be present in Pakistan on this historic occasion, despite the fact that paying my respects at Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib has always been my cherished dream which will hopefully be fulfilled once these hostilities and killings are stopped,\" Captain Amarinder said, according to the  . Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Friday, 23 November, that Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu would visit the country to attend the groundbreaking ceremony of the Kartarpur Border corridor, according to a media report on Friday. Navjot Singh Sidhu wrote, \"I look forward to meeting you on this historic occasion. My application for permission to attend is now lodged with MEA.” Prime Minister Imran Khan will inaugurate the facilities at the crossing on the Pakistan side on 28 November. Sidhu told   that he has gladly accepted the invitation sent by Khan for the 28 November event. He said the Pakistani premier was his friend and he will visit the country whenever he is invited by him, reported PTI. \"I don't have words to express my joy,\" he said.

Today the country’s coastal state governments/UTs lack a permanent cadre for its coastal or marine security police wings and personnel posted there for a few years return to other police duties. As a result, the little hands-on exposure that these police personnel obtain to coastal security is lost when they are transferred elsewhere. For state governments, coastal security management proves to be a challenge because it transcends pure police roles and enters the military realm. And the state governments only possess police forces primarily oriented to operate on land and not the sea. Till the central government raises a Central Marine Police Force (CMPF), the proposed academy will train police personnel from the coastal states/UTs in coastal security management, which straddles both military and police functions. Therefore, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavais mooted the proposal to raise a CMPF in June 2016 at a meeting to review the status of the country’s coastal security management in Mumbai. The state has paid serious attention to coastal security due to the earlier LTTE threat from across the Palk Straits. Raised in 1994, the Tamil Nadu Police Coastal Security Group (CSG) is a well-trained force tasked to protect the state’s 1,076-km coastline. The marine/coastal security police forces in the other eight states and four UTs cannot operationally compare with Tamil Nadu’s CSG. The priorities of the Indian Police are political intelligence and VIP security, among other duties. To therefore expect the state police forces to focus on coastal security management is an unrealistic expectation. The fact that the country has poor police to population ratio with just one policeman for 761 people, which translates into approximately 131 policemen per lakh population, does not enable them to ensure effective coastal security management. Moreover, the state police forces across the country are not really oriented to tackle coastal security, and thereby the need for a CMPF which would fill a vital gap in the national security matrix. Importantly, the lack of progress to install fishing boats with transponders which are linked to the land-based Automatic Identification System is a lacuna in the coastal security system, and nullifies progress made on every other front. Every fishing boat with transponders that is tracked amounts to a pair of ‘eyes’ and ‘ears’ at sea becomes part of the coastal security system. Conversely, every boat not in the system remains a potential threat. State governments believe that national security, especially externally fostered internal security threats are the central government’s responsibility, and therefore, rely on the Indian Navy (IN) and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) across peninsular India to tackle sea-borne terrorist threats. However, the problem arises because the IN patrols the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles given the heavy tonnage of their warships; the ICG covers the waters between 12 and 200 nautical miles. The swathe of seas from the coastline to 12 nautical miles which is afloat with a high density of smaller craft like fishing boats, mechanized trawlers and dhows becomes the responsibility of the coastal/marine police forces. The Centre contributes considerably to the coastal security of peninsular India in terms of marine platforms and funds to establish coastal security police stations; besides other hardware like beach scooters and night vision devices. After the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, the central government established the National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security, with the Cabinet Secretary at its helm, to implement the National Maritime Domain Awareness project. The Navy, assisted by the coast guard, state marine police forces, and other state and central agencies undertook this project. Conceptually speaking, the coast guard is inferior to the fighting navy, but superior to the police in terms of marine platforms, weaponry and training, therefore ideally suited for coastal security management. Its first phase was to provide seamless coverage of India's coastline, which includes installation of a chain of 74 Automatic Identification System receivers along the coast and 46 coastal radars around the country’s mainland and the island territories to track small vessel traffic in the coastal waters. Clearly “boots on the seas” or a coastal security force similar to the Border Security Force, standing guard permanently on the country’s land borders, is necessary to complement this technology-driven security infrastructure. Only an active coastal police force could possibly conduct random checks on cargo in these myriad boats sailing on the shallow waters as a deterrent to wrong doers.

Certain details first. The Russians are double agents, in that they were earlier working for the KGB now known as Federal Security Bureau (FSB) and then defected to the MI6 now called the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in Britain. Both Litivinenko and Skripal were poisoned, first one with a rare radioactive isotope – Polonium 210 and the second one with a nerve agent – Novichok. It was timely medical help that saved Skripal’s life, as the MI6 was well prepared to handle another attempted murder on British soil after the shock and shame of being outwitted by the KGB in Litivinenko’s murder. He was killed in a more primitive way, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, initially with fingers being cut off as part of an aggressive interrogation that devolved, resulting in a painful and tortuous death. President Putin once told a journalist who was becoming a nuisance to the government for highlighting the increasing violence against reporters in 2001, “You know Aleksi, you are not a traitor, you are an enemy”. The journalist asked him what was the difference and how on earth was that supposed to be of any comfort? Putin explained, “Enemies are right in front of you, you are at war with them, then you make an armistice with them, and all is clear. A traitor must be destroyed, crushed,” as quoted by Mark Urban in his latest book  . Though Litivinenko, in his dying declaration, directly blamed Putin for his death, the British government did not reveal it to the press at the time, nor did the Independent Enquiry Commission (set up later) blame Putin directly. They however, blamed the State Agencies of Russia for the death of Litvinenko in October 2006 and the near death of Skripal and his daughter in March 2018. Britain reacted to the killing of Litivinenko almost after 10 years when the Enquiry Commission submitted its report in 2016. It had clearly fixed the responsibility for the killing on Andrei Lugovi and Dmitry Kouvtun, both ex-KGB personnel who were colleagues of Litvinenko. Prime Minister Theresa May however, reacted much more sharply to the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter by expelling 23 Russian diplomats and freezing all Russian assets in the UK. More than 20 European allies expelled over 100 Russian diplomats and officials in solidarity with UK. Theresa May told the House of Commons that this was “the largest collective expulsion of Russian Intelligence officers in history”. Such was the European anger against Russia’s brazen methods of eliminating its traitors. The US too followed suit and expelled about 60 Russian diplomats under the Magnitsky Act, though it stopped short of making a formal determination that it had broken international law. The Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act signed by President Obama in December 2012, was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of a Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison in October 2009. In 2016, the bill was extended globally and authorised the US government to punish human rights offenders, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the US. Even as he announced expulsion of Russian diplomats, President Trump appeared as if he was being forced to take the decision under pressure from the ‘Deep State’, as it went against his deep-rooted desire to build a warm personal relationship with Putin. Only Germany took the matter forward by announcing a freeze on arms sale to Saudi Arabia, while questions hung over Khashoggi’s killing, and asked other European nations to follow the lead. Of all the reactions, President Trump’s reaction is the most genuine one, as he makes no bones as to where America’s interests lie. He has clearly refused to listen to the tape handed over by Turkey, nor has he agreed with the assessment made by the CIA that the murder of Khashoggi was ordered by none other than Mohammed bin Salman himself. Trump’s simple argument is that USD 110 billion of arms deal with Saudi Arabia is at stake, and thousands of jobs in the US are at stake. Again it is the ‘Deep State’ (the military – industrial complex) that is guiding President Trump. Trump is all deviance, sans morality. And he sports his deviance like a badge of honour dedicated to a higher cause – ‘America First’. No human rights, no rule of law can supersede that. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi recently issued 3,800 visas for Sikh pilgrims wanting to visit Pakistan to pay obeisance at Sikh shrines on the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev (the first Guru of the Sikhs) which happens to be on 23 November. A statement issued by the   highlighted the fact, that this is the largest number of visas issued in recent years to Sikh pilgrims. In 2019, Sikhs around the world will be commemorating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The Government of India as well as the Government of Punjab (India) have already listed some of the steps they are likely to take for commemoration (this includes a series of seminars, setting up of chairs at universities) Both sides are at a distance of less than 5 kilometres from each other. Through this corridor, Sikhs will get visa-free access to the historic shrine, and will save them the hassle of travelling all the way to Delhi to secure a visa. While Sidhu’s move to embrace Bajwa was criticised by many in India, including his own party men, he cited the commitment given by Pakistan’s army chief towards opening the religious corridor. This did not spare Sidhu from attacks, with many arguing that he had gone in his personal capacity, and being a minister in the Punjab government, he was in no position to raise the issue. In September 2018, a member of Imran’s Cabinet,   again stated, that irrespective of ties between both countries, Pakistan would open the religious corridor, since it is an issue which pertains to ordinary Sikhs. Later on, as tensions have increased due to repeated militant attacks in Kashmir, as well as the cancellation of talks between Foreign Ministers of India and Pakistan (on the sidelines of the UNGA), Islamabad stated, that the corridor could only go ahead,  The Government of India on its part, first stated that this corridor could only go ahead, if a formal request came from Pakistan, though sections of the security establishment have repeatedly put forward their apprehensions. Even when it seemed that the movement had got a fillip, a   underscored the concerns of intelligence agencies and the army. Congress Member of Parliament  during a visit to the Indian side of the border, stated, “Under the current political scenario, where Pakistani agencies are regularly beheading Indian soldiers, we cannot even think of taking such an initiative.” In spite of a less than enthusiastic New Delhi and an ambivalent Islamabad, activists on the Indian side as well as from the Punjab (Pakistan) Government have continued to raise demands for the religious corridor. In a letter to Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Chief Minister of Punjab (India)   raised the issue, stating that this was of concern to Sikhs. He again took up the issue with the Ministry of External Affairs in November 2018. The Ministry of External Affairs responded by stating that it could not do anything, until it received a formal communication from the Pakistani side. The Government of India recently stated, that it would install a high powered telescope and a screen on the Indian side for a view of the Kartarpur shrine for the benefit of the pilgrims. There was no mention about the issue of the religious corridor. Tensions between both countries have always proven to be an obstacle in people to people linkages between both countries in general, and the two Punjabs in particular; this time it is the Kartarpur Corridor. It is a pity, considering Guru Nanak’s universal message of peace and co-existence. It is also sad, that most Sikhs who want to visit Kartarpur Sahib where the first Guru spent an important phase of his life, are far removed from the politics of the nation-states.

Unrelated intelligence feeds were plugged in to raise the bogey of Islamist terrorism, a much-favoured meme in the current environment where the demonisation of Muslims is a critical instrument of partisan political mobilisation. Zakir Musa and his Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind had come, with their purported Islamic State affiliations, to ‘extend’ his group’s influence into the Punjab. Such claims are undeterred by the fact that Musa and the tiny fragment of the Hizb-ul-Mujahiddeen that he has broken away with, is fighting for its barest survival in Kashmir with a handful of supporters, and is unlikely to harbour ambitions of extension beyond, at this juncture. But if it isn’t Musa, it must be the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM). The movement of a group of JeM terrorists through Punjab and towards Delhi had put the State Police on Red Alert, and so it must be this group who, perhaps wandering by casually, decided to chuck a grenade at the hapless Nirankaris. The very obvious inference – to anyone loosely familiar with the broad trajectory of terrorism in Punjab – that the perpetrators were likely to be tied to a Khalistani formation, seemed entirely to escape the attention of ideologically blinded commentators, but this is what is now unsurprisingly emerging from official pronouncements in Punjab and out of the limited evidence currently available. The Nirankaris – regarded as deviants and blasphemers by the Khalistanis (and the Akalis) – have long been a favourite target of the extremists. Indeed, it is useful to recall that the 15-year nightmare of terrorism in Punjab commenced with the targeting of the Nirankaris by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his Damdami Taksal followers in 1978, culminating in the murder of the head of the sect, Satguru Gurbachan Singh, in April 1980. The one consistent element in the continuous efforts to revive Khalistani terrorism in Punjab has been the role of Pakistan’s ISI, and it is likely to be confirmed in the present case as well. For one thing, almost all major active Khalistani formations have a base in Pakistan and are openly supported by the Army’s intelligence wing. Prominent among these are the Babbar Khalsa International, the Khalistan Zindabad Force, the International Sikh Youth Federation, Dal Khalsa International, the Khalistan Commando Force – Panjwar and the Khalistan Tiger Force. Several past operations, as well as large numbers of arrests and seizures of weapons in Punjab over the years have been linked to these formations. Equally significantly, cells affiliated to these groups, as well as prominent overground Khalistani organisations across the world, receive support from the ISI and Pakistani diplomatic missions, and this was visible in the orchestration of the recent Referendum 2020 demonstration at Trafalgar Square, where potential participants from Pakistan were offered an all expenses paid four-day trip to London. The K-2 project, a plan to ‘unite’ Kashmiri and Khalistani terrorist formations, has been a long term effort on the part of the ISI, though the obvious ideological divergence between Islamist and Sikh fundamentalist terrorist formations have kept any real unity of purpose out of reach over the decades. Nevertheless, some limited operational cooperation has been evidenced in the past, and cannot be excluded in the present or future. Groups like JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba are fully owned enterprises of the ISI, and if told to support specific Khalistani operations, would do so. Such operational cooperation must remain a cause of concern for intelligence and enforcement agencies in the Punjab. The attack at the Nirankar Bhawan has also drawn the usual accusations of intelligence failure – and, of course, every terrorist success does, in some sense, indicate a failure of the intelligence system. However, in most cases it is only in our fantasies that we will be able to discover or predict the specifics of every potential attack to the levels of precision necessary for effective preventive action. It is useful to remind ourselves that the Raja Sansi attack would have taken little more than a few seconds to execute, and could, in fact, have occurred anywhere across Punjab. No country in the world can ever have a security apparatus that can prevent every such possibility. Indeed, numerous intelligence and enforcement successes over the past years elude public attention, since they are seldom reported, or at best, are reported as the arrests of ‘suspected terrorists’, and provoke little interest. The revival of Khalistani terrorism at a scale that threatens the state apparatus remains highly unlikely; the terrorists, however, backed by Pakistan’s state system and by elements in a wealthy diaspora, will ‘get lucky’ from time to time. Crucially, there is no scope for complacence in the face of any measure of terrorism, and no way to predict possible triggers of abrupt escalation. Some political sagacity – instead of the current proclivity to inflame the situation with partisan posturing – will be necessary if Punjab is not to be pushed into an escalatory cycle, however limited.

But why this sudden change in India's policy towards the Dalai Lama? It's an open secret that in the Modi dispensation only one man's writ prevails on all issues - PM Modi. At this juncture, nothing matters more to Modi and the BJP than winning the next general elections, due by April-May 2019 but may well be advanced by a few months. China can rock Modi's boat in a big way. That's why, from Modi's perspective, it is absolutely essential that China cooperates with the Modi government and not create problems. To seek China's cooperation, the Modi government has extended an olive branch to China on its soft underbelly, the Dalai Lama, who is dubbed by China as a “splittist” and a “dangerous separatist”. This is the only explanation for cabinet secretary PK Sinha sending a note (dated February 22 but sent on February 26 presumably after PMO's vetting) to all central ministries and departments as well as all state governments which says \"senior leaders\" and \"government functionaries\" of the Centre and states should stay away from commemorative events planned for March-end and early April by the \"Tibetan leadership in India\" to mark the start of 60 years in exile of the Dalai Lama. The main event of Dalai Lama targeted by the Modi government is \"Thank You India\" being organised at  in New Delhi on April 1. Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile also intends to invite a number of Indian dignitaries for this event which is likely to be followed up by additional events in Delhi as well as other Indian states. Significantly, the cabinet secretary's circular was sent on the advice of the new foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale who until a few months back was Indian ambassador in China and had played a key role in resolution of the 73-day-long Doklam standoff. The cabinet secretary quoted Gokhale’s note to underline “the sensitive nature of the subject”. In his note to the cabinet secretary the foreign secretary stated: “The proposed period will be a very sensitive time in the context of India’s relations with China. Participation by senior leaders or government functionaries, either from the central government or state governments, is not desirable, and should be discouraged.” Modi knows that China is seething over India's unprecedented defiance and a strong stand over the Doklam issue last summer. Although the crisis was resolved after 73 days, Modi has been tipped off by his intelligence apparatus that China may trigger a bigger crisis in Doklam and elsewhere in this summer. Such a scenario would be politically disastrous for Modi, who during the 2014 election campaign had hauled the then Congress government over coals for its submissive approach to China. In the event of China triggering yet another major flashpoint, the Modi government would be pushed on the back foot and the Congress-led Opposition will get a stick to beat the BJP with in the run-up to the next general elections. Only yesterday (March 5)  told parliament that China has built helipads and trenches in Doklam. It's because of this that Modi has turned India's six-decade-old foreign policy on its head. As per Modi's political calculations a possible China-triggered flashpoint would be more harmful for his political future than turning his back on the Dalai Lama. At best, the Opposition would cry foul and issue angry statements against the move, but China would be mollified. Had there been a strong and United Opposition, it would have made life miserable for the government and the prime minister, accusing the government of being soft and pliable and reversing decades-old Indian policy for his short-term political gains. The Opposition has solid reasons to blast the Modi government as it has unilaterally changed a vital component of Indian foreign policy without taking the Opposition into confidence. And that too at a time when the Modi government should have done exactly the opposite after China recently violated two bilateral MoUs and refused to share upstream data on  and cut off Indian pilgrims' access to two sacred sites in Tibet. The Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement on March 2, a national holiday on account of the Holi festival, and said thus: “The government’s position on His Holiness the Dalai Lama is clear and consistent. He is a revered religious leader and is deeply respected by people of India. There is no change in that position. He is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India.” However, the MEA kept mum on the cabinet secretary's note. The Modi government is exercising more caution than ever before in dealing with China not just because PM Modi will be travelling to China in June this year for attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. But it's not for this multilateral event that he has changed his government’s policy on the Dalai Lama in one stroke. He is eyeing much bigger prize in lieu: an India visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is now practically the Chinese president for life after the Chinese Communist Party made changes in its rules. A visit to India by Xi later this year would effectively mean that the Xi-led China won't be rocking India's boat and would presumably refrain from staging the much feared Doklam II. The master political move by Modi makes it clear that it’s more by Modi the politician, rather than Modi, the prime minister.","title":"Why Modi government is willing to snub the Dalai Lama to pacify China","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/the-dalai-lama-event-delhi-modi-government-india-china-ties-thank-you-india/story/1/22695.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15246},{"author":"DS Rai","content":"For the past 14 years, Madhya Pradesh has been ruled by the BJP. And even though many in the state think that the BJP is invincible, a desire for change is gradually gaining strength.   It seems that the people of the state may finally choose the Congress over the BJP. This is also indicated by the Congress’s successive wins in four by-elections in the past one year. However, going by the full-page advertisements of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in local newspapers, an uninformed observer is likely to conclude that Chouhan is as popular as before. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was once his contemporary, Chouhan too has made elections his priority, and often at the cost of governance.   In the past decade, the chief minister has projected every election victory (big or small) as his own alone.   Unsurprisingly, his detractors believe that the Madhya Pradesh chief minister often ignores government work for election work.  However, with recent losses in by-elections, Chouhan’s critics in his party have been quick to lay the blame for the loss at CM’s door. One of those is former BJP MP Raghunandan Sharma who said, that the loss in the Mungaoli and Kolaras by-elections was \"failure of one person and not of the party\". In the past 12 years of Chouhan’s rule, the BJP-RSS combine (it’s hard to distinguish between them in MP), have ensured that their workers and functionaries are benefitted financially, often, through government contracts, tenders and schemes. Most of the public works are now executed by BJP workers-turned-contractors. A majority of the state’s locally elected bodies like \"mandis\", marketing and cooperative societies and municipal bodies are now controlled by the BJP and so is the flow of government funds. The BJP-RSS and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government have made it routine to organise massive functions in the name of festivals, anniversaries and occasions at huge costs incurred by the state exchequer. In addition to such functions, a number of other religion-based events are organised by the BJP-RSS  network of cadres and workers. BJP MLAs and local leaders in their constituencies and areas of influence replicate this template of event management. These are almost always conducted in the presence of priests and \"godmen\" of questionable reputations. Unsurprisingly, those of us living in MP have not failed to notice a sharp growth in the number of religious (Hindu) events and pseudo-religiosity in the state over the past decade or so. More shockingly perhaps, even government officers are expected to use their clout and arrange for logistics and even crowds for such events. Under the threat of falling out of favour with their political bosses, the officers quietly do as expected.   A large number of government-appointed or government-dependent ASHA and Aanganwadi workers as well panchayat secretaries form a bulk of crowds at such gatherings. In fact, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has become so brazen that is has been issuing formal orders to district collectors and other officers asking them to bring in crowds. The most recent example of this is a meeting of workers organised in Jabalpur on February 24.  Naturally, governance is the loser in all of this. Although government officers are not given to airing their views publicly, the fact is that all over the state, officers are fed up of doing what is essentially the political work of the government for more than a decade. My own sense is that most of them genuinely want a change in government in the upcoming assembly elections in the state. They are so pestered by the government that whenever a retired bureaucrat happens to talk about the \"good old days\", they bluntly retort, \"Sir, please don’t talk about those days. Things have change drastically since then\". While the BJP has been successful in expanding its base across castes and tribes, often through religious gurus, the Congress has all, but lost its traditional voter base among Muslims, STs, and SCs.   In the 2013 Assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, these communities voted massively in favour of the BJP.   In many areas of the state, the Congress doesn’t even have booth-level workers, the BJP, on the other hand, has acquired remarkable expertise on booth management. However, the upcoming Assembly elections are going to be Congress’s best shot at unseating the BJP from power. According to some surveys there have been more than 150 scams covering many ministries in the MP government in the past years. The biggest and the most infamous of these is the Vyapam (recruitment and admission) scam.  Although it has to be  remembered that the Congress has so far not been able to \"exploit\" these scams to its own political advantage. The reason for this is an open secret: Congress is a divided house in Madhya Pradesh. Its four major leaders, Kamalnath, Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Arun Yadava have shared a public stage barely once in the past year.  With just a few months to go before the elections, a planned endeavour to reach out to the state’s people is still not visible. The grand old party’s problems are further compounded by a crippling crunch of funds  - an area in which the BJP is far ahead. A large section of Congress workers and the general public believe that only with Scindia as its CM-nominee does the part have any chance of defeating the BJP.   The reasons for this are three-fold: Scindia enjoys a clean image, has freshness of approach and youthful appearance, and is a good orator.   If Scindia is soon declared the Congress’s chief ministerial candidate and allowed to work with a free hand then the party will be able to galvanise public mood in its favour. However, the Congress is known to remain in hibernation until the last moment and for not taking the right decisions at the right time.   Scindia too needs to step out of his traditional fiefdom of Guna and Gwalior and reach out to the entire state if he is to be a serious contender to incumbent chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Despite the handicaps mentioned above, the Congress can come back to power because the people of the state desperately want a change.  Whether it is on social indices like IMR, MMR, malnutrition and education, or crimes against women, Dalits and children, Madhya Pradesh is at the bottom of the spectrum. A large section of people in the state depends on agriculture and feels that it has neither been getting its due nor any real and meaningful sympathy despite a large number of farm suicides in the state. Along with this, corruption has become rampant in the state and has infected every level and arm of the government. There is no respect for government administration and credibility of government is at an all-time low; ideas like the \"Ministry of Happiness\" only underscore the grave intellectual and policy-level bankruptcy of the government. The only visible signs of any development in the state are roads and improved electricity supply, but these too are now crumbling because of corruption and mismanagement. In short, the people of MP want change, but the question is: can Congress get its act together in time to be an alternative?","title":"14 years of BJP rule in Madhya Pradesh: Will Congress pull through?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhya-pradesh-assembly-elections-bjp-shivraj-singh-chouhan-congress/story/1/22689.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15247},{"author":"Ashok K Singh","content":"BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Monday was gloating in triumphalism over the takedown of a   from Tripura’s Belonia College Square. Within 48 hours of notching up a stunning victory in the Assembly elections, Ram Madhav (in his tweet) appeared to suggest, that removal of a life size bronze statue of Lenin was a historical task accomplished. He, however, later deleted the tweet. The “Chalo Paltai” crowd went on razing sculpture, attacking CPI(M) workers and party offices after “takhta palat” (dethroning) of the Manik Sarkar-led government. After a storm of protest on social media,   spoke to the Tripura governor and the state police chief and asked them to ensure peace before the swearing-in of the new government. BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli offered a poor damage-control defence of what could be construed as instigation to party workers to indulge in vandalism. “BJP doesn’t ever practice culture of violence. In places like Tripura, Left parties have chosen to be silent about 11 BJP workers who were killed. Some of those who support Left parties are trying to foist these kind of debates that a statue is removed,” Kohli told ANI. However, Tripura governor   have condoned the act of vandalism. The governor said, \"What one democratically elected government can do another democratically elected government can undo. And vice versa.\" Swamy was more forthright. \"Lenin is a foreigner and in a way, a terrorist, there shouldn't be a statue of this sort of person in our country? They are welcome to put that statue inside the Communist Party headquarters and worship it if they so wish,\" he told ANI. Statues are inanimate objects. They become important when emotions get attached to them. Inanimate objects turn into living memorials and become part of history and folklore. BJP workers can remove Lenin’s statue, but can they erase history? The Left Front government that was in power in Tripura for a quarter of a century, in two installments, has been defeated. But those 25 years can’t be erased from public memory and history. In the current Assembly itself, the CPI(M) represents 45 per cent of the total electorate. The share of votes has not been translated into seats, but that’s a vagary of our electoral system. The BJP can’t erase 45 per cent of the people. On Twitter and other social media platforms, BJP supporters defended the statue’s takedown by venting their ire against CPI(M)’s foreign-influenced ideology. Lenin, a Russian by birth, has no place on the Indian soil, they argued. Are they sure the BJP’s ideology has no ingredients of foreign influence? Are they sure the Guruji’s   entertained no foreign influence? Those very people who get so revolted by foreign influences had organised havans and pujas for the victory of the US President Donald Trump. They thought a new avatar was born in the US who would slay the evil forces residing in the West. The avatar has done no favours to those who sought god’s benediction for him. The Modi government and the people of India were rightly hurt when Ghana decided in October 2016 to remove the statute of  . More than 1,000 university teachers and academics in Ghana had signed an online petition to their government demanding removal of the statue in protest against what they called Gandhiji’s “racist identity”. The statue was erected there barely a couple of months earlier after the then President Pranab Mukherjee had gifted it to Ghana. Gandhiji’s sculpture was shifted from the university square hurriedly lest it could be vandalised. As for Lenin and his sculptures, there could be no more alien place to have a status of Lenin than the US, which the BJP the Modi government are so much enamoured of. This writer was surprised to see a statue of Lenin standing at a prominent public corner in Seattle, the US during a visit there some years ago. The Russian communist revolutionary who is so reviled in the mecca of capitalism has become a landmark in Seattle along with the famous Fremont Troll sculpture in the quirky and artistic neighbourhood of the city. Lenin’s sculpture is on tourists’ itinerary in the city that headquarters Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing and is home to the billionaire Bill Gates. The Seattle city council periodically comes under pressure from the communist baiters to remove the statue. However, there are some who oppose the move. None of those who oppose the removal are communists. Some of them favour seeing Lenin as a relic of the past, some are reminded of the Cold War that tormented the US and some recollect the dreaded years of living under Soviet nuclear arms threat. For some, the 16-foot-tall statute is just an object of curiosity. Seattle’s Lenin statue has an interesting history. In 1981, Czechoslovakia’s communist party commissioned Bulgarian sculptor Emil Venkov for Lenin’s sculpture that was installed in 1988. In 1989, it was taken down during the Velvet Revolution and was lying in a scrapyard until an American teacher of English Lewis E Carpenter came across it, bought it and carted it to Seattle in 1993. It has been standing in Fremont neighbourhood since then. Relics of Soviet Union and the most potent symbol of communist ideology, Vladimir Lenin, no longer pose threat to America. The capitalist oligarchy of Vladimir Putin does. The Seattle city council has kept the sculpture on tourists’ must-see itinerary because Lenin poses no threat to the people over there. But the BJP seems to be haunted by the spectre of Lenin. It has to dismantle sculptures, art and history associated with Lenin lest the politics associated with the relics might come alive. That’s a possibility the BJP has to contend with.","title":"What bulldozing Lenin statue in Tripura says about BJP's brazen politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-lenin-statue-bjp-cpm-ram-madhav-chalo-paltai-governor-tathagata-roy-subramanian-swamy/story/1/22691.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15248},{"author":"Anand Kochukudy","content":"Extending its poor run in Assembly elections since losing power at the Centre in 2014, Congress has been completely wiped out from Tripura and Nagaland. It has also   despite emerging as the single-largest party in the state. As had happened in Goa and Manipur in 2017, the BJP has come from behind to cobble together a rainbow alliance in Meghalaya with merely 2 MLAs. While Congress did show some decisiveness in sending its top troubleshooter Ahmed Patel along with senior leaders Kamal Nath and Mukul Wasnik to the state quickly, it was apparently too late in the day. The Congress' lack of foresight in anticipating all kinds of results was once again sorely exposed even as BJP's Ram Madhav and Himanta Biswas Sarma ensured that they struck a deal in less than 24 hours. Congress has been ruling Meghalaya since 2003 but for a year's break in 2008. The resultant anti-incumbency and BJP holding power at the Centre played its part in non-Congress parties coming together, facilitated by the BJP. In the bargain, the National People's Party (NPP) led by  , son of the late Purno Sangma, has emerged as the leader of the alliance with 19 MLAs, supported by regional parties UDP, HSPDP and the newly formed PDF. Sangma paraded 34 MLAs as he went to meet the governor on Sunday evening, March 4, and will be sworn in as the chief minister on Tuesday. The BJP's stated aim of a \"Congress-mukt Bharat\" is becoming a reality at a faster pace than anybody would have imagined with the grand old party now relegated to merely three full-fledged states - Punjab, Karnataka and Mizoram. Karnataka goes to polls in a couple of months and Mizoram at the end of this year. Rahul Gandhi's  at another crucial moment has invited criticism from all corners and deservedly so. In fact, Congress campaign in all three northeastern states that went to polls in February was low-key and Rahul Gandhi visited Meghalaya just a couple of times in the run-up to the elections. It almost seemed that the Congress was resigned to losing the polls even before the election. This lethargy despite putting up an impressive performance in Gujarat and claiming moral victory doesn't bode well as general elections are due next year. With BJP aggressively expanding in state after state in every region, Congress seems to have worked out the opposite strategy of putting all their eggs in one basket and concentrating on a single state at a time like regional outfits. While all their energy was focussed on Gujarat earlier, it seems Karnataka has now replaced Gujarat as the focal point. While the electoral significance of Karnataka cannot be understated, this strategy is not likely to work against the marauding BJP if Congress wishes to retain its position as the national alternative. It parallels the strategy adopted by the Left in the heydays of Indira Gandhi when they were reduced to an insignificant force in the Hindi belt. The obvious problem with this strategy is that, even after putting all their resources to use in Gujarat, Congress still came up short. And in Karnataka, despite being on a solid wicket, anything less than an outright win will surely prompt the JDS to strike an alliance with the BJP (despite assurances to the contrary by Deve Gowda) and displace Congress. The pre-poning of the general elections to coincide with the Assembly elections to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram is predicated on such a result. While Congress leaders claim off the record that a severe cash crunch is one of their biggest constraints, it simply cannot be an excuse for a party that ruled New Delhi for two terms in the immediate past, apart from its legacy since independence. The Nagaland Congress unit has been on record claiming that they were left to fend for themselves as the party merely put up candidates in 18 of the 60 constituencies. Even in Tripura, where the Congress got 45 per cent of the vote share in the 48 seats it contested in 2013, the party drew a blank this time on account of the apathy of the central leadership thereby ceding its space in entirety to the BJP. This kind of mismanagement is criminal and the Congress cannot afford it at this crucial juncture. The Northeast region's eight states command a total of 25 seats, 14 of them in Assam alone. And Congress' diminishing fortunes in the region can be traced back to the events leading up to the Assembly elections in Assam in 2016 and Himanta Biswas Sarma's revolt and alleged humiliation by Rahul Gandhi. It seems Congress is still paying for   as Sarma is not only key to BJP in Assam but hugely popular in adjacent states as well. BJP made him the convener of the North East Democratic alliance (NEDA) formed to bring all the non-Congress parties under the NDA umbrella and it has paid off spectacularly for the party once only known for its existence in the Hindi belt. Congress had long ignored the electoral significance of Northeast and had depended on being in power at the Centre and the \"intelligence network\" that runs parallel to elected governments in some of these states. True, BJP seems to have deep pockets and an unlimited supply of cash through its capitalist friends and other sources. But sadly, Congress hasn't learned much from the disasters in Goa and Manipur, where they had emerged as the single-largest party but was outsmarted by the BJP. Or, it could be argued that smaller parties have been wary of the Congress' inability to keep its flock together in Arunachal Pradesh and BJP's ability to induce legislators to switch sides. Congress could do better than having just CP Joshi as the pointsman for its strategy in the Northeast by having a designated general secretary in-charge for every state, however big or small. The feudal system of extending patronage and keeping decision-making centralised, especially after losing power in New Delhi, is not fit for the politics of the day and the party is learning it the hard way. It's time Congress delegated more powers to the lower levels and improved its man management. Despite being hamstrung by corruption allegations and the ban on coal mining getting pinned on them, the party still came up with a decent performance against a fragmented Opposition but still couldn't form a government. The blame for this situation rests squarely with the central leadership of Congress that has once again been caught napping. With its failure to negotiate a deal with the Samajwadi Party to be the sole contestant in the Phulpur by-election against the BJP, everything now rests on Karnataka for Indian National Congress.","title":"Congress failing to form government in Meghalaya is a new low","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/meghalaya-meghalaya-assembly-elections-northeast-elections-congress-amit-shah-bjp/story/1/22668.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15249},{"author":"Sharat Pradhan","content":"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo   on Sunday, March 4, to support the Samajwadi Party (SP) in by-polls to two Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh later this month has come as a big surprise to all those who have been witness to the bitterness that has prevailed between the two parties for nearly three decades. No wonder, there is great scepticism among political observers, who are seeing beyond what meets the eye in the development. Visibly, this may appear to be a good beginning towards a \"mahagathbandhan\" (grand alliance) against the increasingly powerful Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, this could also be a ploy on the part of a shrewd Mayawati to make an entry into the Rajya Sabha. Without spelling out her own political ambitions, she went on record to state, \"I would expect Samajwadi Party to support the BSP nominee for Rajya Sabha, while we would extend support to their candidate in the state legislative council.\" Refraining from describing the move as a precursor to a \"mahagathbandhan\", she sought to clarify, \"All that my party men have resolved to do is to extend support to the party that has the best potential to give BJP a run for its money at the forthcoming by-elections to two Lok Sabha seats in UP.\" The by-poll is due on March 11 in  , the two prominent parliamentary constituencies, vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, respectively. Both have got berths in the state legislative council (upper house of the state legislature). Theoretically, Mayawati's announcement means a lot and is seen as a \"good beginning\" towards the formation of a grand alliance against the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But it may be too far-fetched to assume that this last-minute declaration would make any major impact on the by-elections. The announcement notwithstanding, whether it would be possible for Mayawati to transfer her party's votes to the Samajwadi Party within such a short span of time remains a million dollar question. After all, BSP supporters are largely the economically weaker Dalits, who have little access to television news. Even we were to assume that they do have access to the TV news, it may not prove so simple to convince a fairly large section of Dalits to vote for a party believed to be dominated by Yadavs, who are considered the biggest oppressors of the downtrodden Dalits. It would have been a different matter if the move was to be treated as the first step towards a Bihar like grand alliance against the BJP. But such a grand alliance would not be complete till the Congress joins in. Mayawati's announcement hasn't come without preconditions, the foremost being SP's support for a Rajya Sabha berth. Each aspirant for Rajya Sabha requires a minimum of 38 votes from members of the state Assembly. With a paltry strength of just 17 in the UP Assembly, Mayawati was far short of numbers which she could get only from Samajwadi Party, which has a strength of 46. Here too what Mayawati is understood to have demanded that the SP gives the BSP Rajya Sabha candidate its first preference votes to ensure a smooth sail. The SP can do so only by sacrificing its own candidate. In the event of SP pushing its own nominee first, it would have only 8 surplus votes to be passed on to Mayawati. Now, assuming that additional support of Congress party's seven members would also be forthcoming, Mayawati would still remain six short of the desired figure of 38. That is the reason Mayawati is understood to be insisting on ensuring the first preference support from SP. Evidently, while both SP and BSP have been busy proclaiming that their main objective is to fight \"communal forces\" (read BJP), the fact of the matter is that Mayawati is seeking her pound of flesh from SP. Relations between Mayawati and then SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav soured after SP supporters assaulted BSP legislators and even tried to storm into Mayawati's room in the UP government's State Guest House way back on June 2, 1995, after she withdrew support from the Mulayam-led SP-BSP coalition government. With the passage of time, the relations worsened as Mayawati continued to believe that SP's attack on the guest house was actually an attempt on her life. After the Yadav family feud culminated in SP's rout in the  , Akhilesh Yadav was often heard expressing his inclination to join hands with the BSP. Now that Mulayam is virtually out of the Akhilesh's scheme of things, Mayawati has chosen to let bygones be bygones. Surely, it is a testing time for Akhilesh who is now clearly in a tight corner. In order to prove that he really meant to combat \"communal forces\", he would have to abdicate his party's claim to the only Rajya Sabha seat available to it. However, there can be no doubt that SP's tactical sacrifice could change the dynamics of the 2019 general elections.","title":"Truth behind why Mayawati is aligning with SP","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mayawati-akhilesh-yadav-uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2019-general-elections-mulayam-singh-yadav/story/1/22659.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15250},{"author":"Rajdeep Sardesai","content":"Maybe it's the skill of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convert every state election into a \"national\" battle, but never before has an election result to three small states in the Northeast attracted such media attention. So here are my 10 takeaways from the battle for the Northeast, the first big election verdict of 2018. 1) The BJP is by some considerable distance the country's premier national party. It isn't just the fact that the BJP is in power in 21 states, it's just how rapidly they have expanded their geographical footprint. When they came to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP was in government in just half a dozen states; from there to their present status in the span of just four years is a quite remarkable achievement. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah must take a lot of credit because they have quite clearly reinvented election strategies: a robust 24x7 campaigning style that is relentless and rewarding. There may be just five Lok Sabha seats at stake between Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland, and the results may have no impact on the 2019 general elections or the next big state battle in Karnataka in May, but the BJP's presence in government in all three states gives the Modi-Shah combine the psychological ascendancy once again, a conviction that it remains electorally on a roll (that it has also happened just on the eve of a Parliament session is a side benefit in ensuring clever headline management in the times of Nirav Modi and bank defaults!) 2) Tripura is the ultimate proof of the BJP's formidable election machine, arguably the most effective vote gathering juggernaut in Independent India. To win a state where in the previous election,   is a swing in fortunes that is unprecedented. No single factor is responsible: a focussed leadership, a strong RSS cadre based organisation, artful booth management, plentiful resources, a strategic if risky tie-up with a local tribal outfit, a weakened Congress, a fatigued Left, have all come together to allow the lotus to bloom in Agartala. But above all else, it's the audacity of ambition that is impressive: Who would have thought tiny Tripura would be so firmly on the BJP's radar? In fact, when Amit Shah spoke of the BJP targeting Tripura as a \"growth\" state a few years ago, there was a measure of incredulity in the response even from those within the party; now, he is seen as a modern day Chanakya! That a cadre-based right was able to challenge a cadre-based Left on its home turf and win must make this victory smell particularly sweet. 3) No election is won by individuals alone. The BJP has a \"team\" with Modi as the all powerful general, Shah as his deputy but crucially, enough local level commanders to spearhead the charge.   has proved himself as a man for all seasons from Kashmir to Kohima; Himanta Biswa Sarma is the BJP's Northeast army corps commander and the BJP Tripura in-charge Sunil Deodhar is the anonymous battalion leader who can inspire troops (karyakartas) into a tough battle. Deodhar, like Modi, is a RSS \"pracharak\", the kind of nuts and bolts committed organisation man that the other parties so desperately lack at the moment. Deodhar doesn't want to be Rajya Sabha MP, doesn't want to be a minister, just is an old fashioned political activist who has put party and ideology above self, spending years building the RSS shakha network across the Northeast. 4) The BJP has leveraged its four years at the Centre and two years in power in Assam to build a strong equation with potential allies in the Northeast. The relationship may be transactional at one level and often leveraged through money power (every Northeast government depends on central funding) but by forging a broad North East Democratic alliance, there is a genuine platform which has been created to address grievances. That the PM has himself invested time and personal equity in consciously projecting a \"look/act east\" policy - holding major central government meetings in a Guwahati and Shillong is one step - has helped build a trust quotient that has made it easier to stitch convenient regional alliances. 5) The BJP has also shown the political \"flexibility\" to \"customise\" its agenda to address diverse constituencies. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asauddin Owaisi was once quoted as saying, \"For the BJP, beef is mummy in Delhi and yummy in the north east.\" He wasn't wrong. But what the BJP's rivals will see as duplicity could well be explained as a recognition of a diverse cultural ethos by a party which for the longest time was defined by a \"Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan\" brand of politics. The dissonance may still rear its head in the future but that the BJP has been able to make itself \"acceptable\" in Christian dominated Nagaland and Meghalaya is not without significance. Yes, the BJP won just two seats in Meghalaya and is a marginal party in Nagaland, and has ridden to power by \"deal-making\" with regional parties but there is clearly no ideological isolation or political untouchability of the kind that haunted the BJP in the 1990s. It is interesting that the hill parties of Meghalaya, for example, chose the BJP to form a government with when they had the option of siding with the Congress (even the Sangmas of the BJP's Meghalaya ally NPP were once a Congress family). Nagaland is less of a surprise: Naga parties have traditionally chosen to deal with whoever is in power at the Centre. Of greater concern here is the Nagaland framework agreement signed with Naga militant groups in 2015 but still not made public and whether the agreement will lead to a more durable peace. 6) The Congress, once the dominant force of the Northeast, is now a party in retreat. In 2014, the Congress was in power in five of the states in the region; now, it just has tiny Mizoram to show for itself. What happened in Arunachal was morally indefensible but the Congress leadership did itself no favours by procrastinating in a crisis. In Manipur, a strong local satrap like Ibobi Singh at least offered a challenge. Elsewhere, the party has allowed a familiar rust and decay to set in, symbolic of its overall national health. Tripura is a good example. The BJP made its initial inroads in Tripura primarily because the Congress just evaporated, first taken over by the Trinamool Congress and then the BJP. It's the 36 per cent Congress vote of 2013 that was reduced to single digits in 2018. The party's campaign in Tripura never took off, it contested just 18 seats in Nagaland, and allowed the situation to drift in Meghalaya till it was too late. Its general secretary for the Northeast, CP Joshi, has earned the dubious reputation of being a leader who can snatch defeat from victory if required (the Congress has just split in Bihar, another state which he presides over). Contrast Joshi's lethargy with the raw energy of a Biswa Sarma, the BJP's Assam-based go getting leader. To think that Biswa Sarma was dyed in the wool Congressman till just over two years ago is another reminder of how easily the party has squandered its own talent by choosing not to empower those who may challenge the status quo with their ambition and desire. 7) After its \"moral\" victory in Gujarat and an impressive showing in the Rajasthan by-elections, the Congress leadership convinced itself that it was on the right track to recovery. Rahul Gandhi's ascent to party presidentship was seen as a sign that the first family of the party was back in business. And yet,   in the Northeast only confirm the suspicion that he is still a work in progress, alternately confident and casual, a well-intentioned leader still unable to lead aggressively and consistently from the front. Gandhi only addressed one meeting in Tripura on the last day of the campaign and ignored Nagaland altogether. May be, it was a lost cause in any case but what is the message to the party workers if the leader gives up so easily? Rahul was more assertive in Meghalaya where the party was in the race but here again he might have been better off spending a full week campaigning in the state rather than dashing off to launch his Karnataka campaign, a state where elections are still a few months away. Perhaps, the final proof of Rahul's on-off approach to politics was when he chose to spend the results weekend in Italy with his \"Nani\". Nothing wrong in surprising your grand-ma with a \"hug\", but surely that could have waited till the election results were out. The optics are once again misconceived: this is a week to be hugging your candidates who have won, grandma perhaps can wait! Rahul's supporters may insist that time is on their side, but time waits for no one, and may be running out rapidly ahead of the 2019 general elections. Winning Karnataka (and later in the year, Rajasthan) is make or break for the Congress leadership's immediate political calculations. 8) Like the Congress, the Left too needs to go back to the drawing board. A few months ago, when I suggested to a Left leader in Delhi that the BJP might offer a real challenge in Tripura, I was brushed aside: \"You journalists are easily swayed by Modi-Shah's media blitz. Tripura is not Gujarat!\" Indeed, Tripura was not Gujarat. While in Gujarat, the BJP was able to fight off a 25 year anti-incumbency, in Tripura, a mix of complacency and arrogance meant that winning a sixth election in a row was a bridge too far. Yes,   and we could celebrate his being the country's \"poorest\" CM but he was also ultimately a one man show. Yes, he brought peace and stability to the border state, but peace cannot guarantee jobs. As its Tripura model unravelled, the CPM has chosen to blame the BJP for misusing money power rather than look within. Living in denial won't help the Left: its precipitous decline in neighbouring Bengal is a consequence of this intransigent attitude. With 42 per cent of the vote, the Left still retains a solid core base in Tripura, but its ideology needs to attract the younger voters in particular to remain relevant. 9) As politics gets localised, every state result must be seen in isolation. An impressive BJP triumph in Tripura for example doesn't necessarily mean that the party will make similar strides in Left ruled Kerala or, indeed, in Bengal, the other potential \"growth\" state. But there is growing evidence to suggest that the BJP is rapidly occupying the spaces vacated by the Congress to emerge as a challenger to existing political alignments in states where once the Congress was the premier national force. Expect Odisha to be the more immediate potential \"target\" state in 2019 with Bengal and Kerala also on the radar. And yet, the main challenge for the BJP to remain on top in 2019 is retaining its bastions in north and west India. 10) Personally, the best news for me is the fact that the dramatic rise of the BJP in the Northeast has forced the news media, and TV in particular, to focus on a neglected region. I have often called it the \"tyranny of distance\" but the fact is that the Northeast has been in real danger of falling off the national news map. That it has taken a landmark election result in Tripura to reduce the gap between Agartala and national news headquarters is a positive sign. Hopefully, although I rather doubt it, we will be forced to keep our gaze on the region beyond just another exciting T20 like election counting day! Next stop Karnataka!

Justice Joseph, as the chief justice of the Uttarakhand High Court, had led the bench that trounced the proclamation of the then president of India to resurrect the Congress state government. The Union of India did not like it and possibly not forgotten it. Reports suggest that citing breach of \"seniority\" the  recommendations sent by the Supreme Court collegium to appoint Uttarakhand High Court chief justice, KM Joseph, as a judge of the apex court, and justice Surya Kant of Punjab and Haryana High Court as chief justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court. Tagging on the candidature of   appears to be a ruse to justify the reluctance of the government to accommodate justice Joseph. Reasons are not far to seek and it would not go down well with those who see the need for institutional integrity in ensuring  independent voices as occupants  on the apex court bench. For the healthy functioning of democracy, there ought to be harmony between the three pillars - the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. While no one institution can be seen to be kowtowing to the other, respect and regard for the role of the other is necessary. Yes, the executive and the legislature are cut up over judicial transgressions into the territory of the other. There are undeniable instances of judicial overreaching seemingly belittling the roles of the other two pillars. But, to the informed, it would appear that it is the failure of the executive and the legislative branches to satisfactorily perform their roles that has led to the inexorable reality of the judiciary being \"constrained\" to fill in the breach.   Yes, the executive and the legislature may be peeved at the usurped right to appoint judges to constitutional courts to the collegium. It was an innovation conceived, introduced and being implemented by the apex court which was not even contemplated by the makers of the Constitution. It was veritable judicial legislation unheard of in the annals of any democratic jurisprudence. But it became  a \"necessary compulsion\" as the executive was seen to be overreaching its domain and not laying store by meaningful \"consultative\" process with the judiciary represented by the chief justice of India.  Judicial appointments were getting \"too political\" in \"committed candidates\" for the nation’s comfort that the Supreme Court in the Second Judges Case in 1993 chose to take charge. Ever since, the other two pillars have been trying to get even with the judiciary. Despite the cleavage in political opinions, the legislators got together, across the aisle to move a constitutional amendment and a legislation in the National Judicial Appointments Commission. Both Houses of Parliament passed the statute unanimously except for the sole dissent of Ram Jethmalani in the Rajya Sabha, toeing his own line. The requisite number of state Assemblies also fell in line and the NJAC became a reality, only to be challenged before the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association. From day one of the proceedings, it was evident from what fell from the bench that the NJAC may not pass constitutional muster. The presence of the law minister in the decision-making body of the commission was held to be the \"red rag\" indicative and conclusive of political interference into the sanctified territory of \"independent judiciary\". The rest of the challenge paled into insignificance, and despite the original expectation that the NJAC may after all sail through, since an otherwise divided polity had got together as one, after over two decades of repeated attempts, possibly with a \"reading down\" of the provision relating to the presence of the law minister and \"eminent person\" and making the elective body with an odd number, giving primacy to the vote of the chief justice of India. Alas, it was not be. A 4-1 verdict with justice J Chelameswar alone in dissent meant the NJAC was confined to the dustbin of constitutional history. The executive and the legislature appear to have been side-lined by the judiciary in a unique case of \"judges anointing themselves\" in a precedent of rarity. Arun Jaitley christened that as \"unelected tyranny\". Latching on to the fig leaf on offer to put in place a consensual memorandum of procedure (MoP), the central government seems to be asserting the role of the executive. The MoP has been doing the rounds between the collegium and government, and the final version of March 2017 is lying unresponded to by the executive. Incidentally, this issue was also flagged of by four of the senior-most judges when they went public on the roster control of the chief justice of India. By convention, when the collegium reiterates its view, when sent back by the executive, it shall prevail. This is akin to the constitutional position when the cabinet seeks the nod of the president of India, and the president returns the matter for the cabinet to reconsider. If the cabinet sticks to its recommendation, the president shall have to fall in line (Article 74 (1) of Constitution). It was a healthy convention, which the collegium recommendations also assumed, with the top court imprimatur. It may do a world of good to the Modi dispensation to yield to the collegium recommendation for justice Joseph, whose credentials are otherwise with not a speck of doubt. In citing seniority as the basis for blocking, the executive appears to be inventing excuses for its political decision.

Indeed, even die-hard optimists gave the CPM a thin margin, perhaps, a neck-and-neck chance, considering the organised rise of the BJP and the RSS in Tripura, with full money power, hyperbolic promises and loaded with central resources. Plus, there was the inter-play of complex factors that underlined the politics and social demography of this tiny \"peaceful state\" in close proximity with Bangladesh. Peaceful - for more reasons than one. For four decades and more, the CPM ruled the state, and for many, it was the sober and simple personality of Manik Sarkar which shined in the green landscape. Sarkar gave away his entire salary to the party, lived on Rs 2,000 plus per month given by the party, with a tiffin of puffed rice, apparently his favourite, had a bank balance of less than Rs 2,000, just a fraction of a little land on the outskirts of capital Agartala shared with his sister, no car, no property, no email account, not even a mobile. He was certainly a stoic, classical communist, and Tripura seemed proud of him, even while the party bosses in Delhi, Kerala and Kolkata, never really thought it important to showcase him in the national stage. His wife, Panchali Bhattacharya, a retired government official, travelled on rickshaw and public transport, and was as stoic and classical a communist as her husband. There are other reasons as well, as to why it took so long for anti-incumbency and the rise of Hindutva to outsmart Sarkar’s regime. He effectively restored peace and communal harmony in a state infested with violent insurgency and cross-border terrorism and strife. He was the first to abolish the draconian   (AFSPA), unite the Bengalis and the tribals, stop the forces of separatism (now aligned with the BJP), clean up the system, raise literacy to almost 90 per cent, eliminate poverty and malnutrition in large areas, push for women’s empowerment as a policy on the ground, restore law and order, give tribals their traditional rights. He also blocked hate politics which seemed to have stalked other parts of the country, especially the Hindi heartland, since the arrival of the BJP’s majority regime in Delhi since 2014. Literacy and unemployment, though, went hand-in-hand, due to lack of infrastructure, investment and industry; but, Sarkar would nonchalantly respond that this has been a national phenomena since the new regime in Delhi has failed in all its promises, and a direct fallout of demonetisation as well. So why blame only tiny Tripura? However, to come face to face with the bitter realism of the contemporary scenario, the BJP has risen for the following complex electoral and social factors: Ruling for 25 years with impeccable honesty is just not enough for the modern electorate, especially the aspiring educated classes, high on the flip-side of globalisation and liberalisation, and low on history, philosophy or social sciences. The downward filter theory has not really worked in India, but it is still an eternally seductive and addictive lollypop - hanging like \"lucy in the sky with diamonds\". Anti-incumbency is the primary reason for the loss of Sarkar’s  government, even  while the Opposition, namely the Congress and a section of the Trinamool Congress have been decimated, coopted, sidelined, subverted or bought over, most of it willfully, with the Congress high command in Delhi, head safely in the sand, refusing to see the writing on the wall. The Congress in-charge of Tripura, CP Joshi, reportedly, visited it only once, while   displayed little interest. Most elected representatives of these parties went over to the BJP, so that many seem to have only voted for the old Congress in a new saffron avatar. The tribal-Bengali conflict has been simmering for decades, and it goes to the credit of Sarkar, who reconciled the difficult layers of inherited differences. While a large chunk of Bengali voters have been aligned with the Congress, the tribals, with their indigenous rights ushered in by the Left regime, chose to go with the CPM. The separatist and militant Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPTF), which got zero votes in the last Assembly polls in 2013, has won eight out the nine it contested, thereby clearly implying that the tribal vote base along with a large chunk of the Bengali vote base has shifted away from the Left to the separatists and the BJP. Almost the entire Congress voter base has gone over to the BJP. According to unconfirmed reports, the CPM has scored around 47 per cent votes, still the largest share. The BJP, with 42 per cent and the IPTF, with 8 per cent, has scored a combined tally of 50 per cent. Indeed, for the BJP, it is still a risky proposition, combining the Bengali vote base with the militant tribal separatism. This can crack anytime, or create sharp fissures. Time will tell how it will play its dangerous Hindutva card in this edgy scenario in a strategically located state. What is significant in Tripura, as in West Bengal, is that there is an eternal and incipient communal current in the mainstream Bengali population. How the Congress in the past, in the  absence of Hindutva forces, was able to use this current, and yet failed to topple a stagnating CPM, remains a mystery. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has outclassed the Left by appropriating all the inherited intellectual symbols of the Bengali heritage: from Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, to Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Vivekananda, Rani Rashmoni, you name it. Even Satyajit Ray and megastar Uttam Kumar’s photogenic memories, along with the other legends, are carved all across Kolkata, adorned with Mamata’s picture - making her the proud inheritor of a great legacy. Red flags or Left wall graffiti seem to have vanished in Kolkata, where local clubs, once CPM bastions, have been taken over by Trinamool, while rural Bengal, where the CPM did land reforms and entrenched its extra-constitutional, often, lumpen base, has opportunistically shifted to the  ruling regime. The BJP, despite coming second in some bypolls in Bengal, can’t even plant its flag in large parts of rural Bengal. Indeed, observers believe that the Tripura result might polarise the communal dimension among certain sections of sectarian Bengalis, especially in the middle class, and in border areas. The chanting of \"Jai Sri Ram\", communal polarisation, and the rise of Hindutva was marked since 2014 in Tripura when the RSS took over the shakhas and injected new dynamism to its politics in the border - with the eternal phobia of the Bangladeshi Muslim factor being played to the hilt.   Sarkar’s popularity or honesty, however, could not hide occasional cases of corruption, faulty implementation of grassroots programmes, the weakening of the Left’s organisational structure, and some of the Left leaders choosing not to be so die-hard honest as their chief minister. Finally, Sarkar has to pay the price. The irony is that when Prakash Karat became general secretary of the CPM, he declared that they will enter the Hindi heartland. From UPA 1 in 2004, the 60 united Left numbers in the Lok Sabha have been reduced to about 10 in the current Lok Sabha. The CPM has been finished in Bengal, defeated decisively in Tripura. While the   line plays out in full glare, the fall and fall of the Left in contemporary India is as transparent as the old Marxist prophecy: history repeats itself, first as a farce, then, as tragedy, and a nightmare.","title":"Why Manik Sarkar failed to stop BJP's win in Tripura Assembly elections","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-assembly-election-results-manik-sarkar-cpm-bjp-rss-hindutva-bengalis-congress/story/1/22642.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15253},{"author":"Nikhil Wagle","content":"In September 1995, a bizarre news story made headlines. The idol of lord Ganesha was apparently drinking milk, and the entire country was talking about it. The media had particularly gone berserk. While most journalists sought comments from politicians or scientists, Surendra Pratap Singh, who used to edit and anchor “Aaj Tak” - a news bulletin on Doordarshan that later culminated into a news channel - sent his reporter to a cobbler. He simplified the capillary action and explained it beautifully to the viewers. As I watched, or rather read about, the crass media coverage of  death, I missed my friend SP Singh, more than ever. Unfortunately, SP passed away prematurely. News channels, including the one he founded, would have been better off with his perspective that was so palpably missing. Because that's the purpose an editor is supposed to serve - to put developments in perspective, irrespective of the TRPs. In the quest to “break news”, channels did not follow any of the basic rules of cross-verification. And what followed after that was sheer black comedy. Deep discussions ranging from whether an excellent dancer could fall in a bathtub to whether India has a “bathtub culture” with images of drowning Sridevi with Boney Kapoor watching along to enhance our experience. A South Indian reporter went a step further and literally entered a bathtub, leaving behind all the English and Hindi channels. Amid the madness, how could BJP MP Subramanian Swamy keep mum? He demanded an inquiry between Dawood Ibrahim and the Hindi film industry, suggesting foul play. Like a postman, ANI passed it on to news channels without countering him, and the news channels carried it. I am neither shocked nor surprised. Private news channels have been on the rise since 2000. And incidents like Sridevi's would be found in abundance if we peep into the recent history of these channels. Take the example of little   who fell into a well, or even the   case. A few weeks back when the news media was consumed with  , some of the reporters had donned Padmavati's costume to present news. Why should this be called \"journalism\" is a million-dollar question. When commentators or media critics point out the nonsense disguised as journalism, an easy excuse of TRP is thrown back at the critics. While the viewers, to whom I will come later in the piece, are responsible for abetting the sorry state of journalism, the primary responsibility lies with the editors. Journalism cannot always be viewer-driven. There is no denying the viewership generates revenues and is essential for the sustenance of channels, but not at the cost of journalistic integrity. If the owners insist on TRP-driven programmes, shouldn't the editors stand up to them? Why cannot they have faith in themselves to engage the viewers with good content? I headed a news channel for seven years, which was watched and embraced by the state of Maharashtra. Not once the management knocked on my doors to pressurise me for TRP-driven programmes because we provided content. I sent my reporters to the field, instead of bathtubs. Editors today have become lazy. They do not want to work hard for numbers. But in the conquest of cheap success, they have sacrificed good journalism. They have reduced journalism to a platform for cheap entertainment. The most unfortunate part is it is not happening out of lack of skill, but lack of conscience. When you head a TV channel, you have a certain responsibility towards the society. And when people in positions of power start selling their souls, it seeps into the society as well. Indian journalism has rich history right from the time of   inspired Raja Ram Mohan Roy. The legacy continued through the freedom struggle and thereafter as well. But in the last decades or so, the entire legacy has been shredded into pieces. There is nothing wrong in aspiring to be the most-viewed channel. But as I said earlier, it cannot be achieved through shortcuts. Simply echoing the “public sentiment” is not journalism. And the guests participating in it, validate and legitimise the circus. Which brings me to the viewers, who are as culpable here. I was in Mumbai and Nasik the day after Sridevi passed away. Not a single household I stepped into had anything other than Sridevi on their TVs. The channels discussing it insensitively and the viewers watching it with equal voyeurism. It is a fact that the channels feasting on Sridevi's death are the ones that are most watched. Viewers enable editors to be mediocre, and vice versa. We have been caught in a vicious circle. The question is, how long will this blame game continue? Will the viewers stop watching these channels? Will the editors think of journalism first and TRPs later? The need to look inwards is starker than ever, because it wasn’t just Sridevi's funeral that took place on Wednesday. Journalist Barkha Dutt aptly came up with the hashtag “ ”. And all of us provided a shoulder to it.","title":"Who is responsible for 'news ki maut'?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sridevi-death-media-coverage-voyeurism-bollywood-tv-news-channels-trp/story/1/22644.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15254},{"author":"David Frawley","content":"In retrospect, the biggest political news of 2017 in India was the landslide BJP win in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous in India, followed by Yogi Adityanath taking over as the new chief minister. The magnitude of this victory was unexpected and sent shockwaves throughout the country, compounded by the fact that a saffron monk was chosen to lead the state. The Congress could not even hold on to the Gandhi  . The UP event was augmented by the BJP to Bihar alliance government, as Nitish Kumar abandoned Lalu Prasad's RJD that was steering the state back towards crime and corruption. The recent additional convictions of Lalu and the investigations into his family show the wisdom of this move by Nitish. The result is that the main Hindu heartland of UP and Bihar is now under BJP or saffron rule and a unitary Hindu vote is emerging in areas in which  had previously prevailed. This Hindu vote, however, is not a mere religious assertion or promotion of religious intolerance, as some would say, but an awakening of Indians to their cultural unity and ancient heritage. The so-called Hindu nationalism is not a regressive tendency, but an aspirational move to a new India much as PM Narendra Modi has noted, which honours the great dharmic civilisation of the region and aims at sustaining its continuity. This is different from the Nehruvian India that was more an imitation of failed Western socialist states than anything Indian or dharmic. The UP poll marked the removal of the Nehruvian shadow from the centre of the country. The more recent Gujarat election has been emphasised as a Congress revival, mainly because the BJP did not win through a landslide margin, not because Congress actually won. That losing an election less badly is promoted as positive news for the Congress only shows how far the party has fallen from power. The fact is at the end of the year, the BJP is governing a great majority of states in India and Congress-ruled states are a mere footnote. The Gujarat election was conducted in the shadow of the UP election. Rahul Gandhi ran as the newly appointed (one cannot accurately say elected) Congress president. Though Rahul had not previously showed any interest in Hindu temples, much less overtly supporting any Hindu causes - he went on an extensive political temple tour, visiting more than 20 temples in Gujarat. More notably, he suddenly called himself a thread wearing Brahmin Hindu, strange for one who was long happy to live quietly in the shadow of a Christian mother as if he were a Christian himself. No other leader in the Nehru/Gandhi dynasty has ever made such a clear statement of Hindu identity, not even Indira Gandhi who regularly visited Hindu gurus. Yet, it is not devotion to Hinduism but political necessity that seems to have motivated his statement. The Congress has not given up its old anti-Hindu policies in this overt change to a  . It continues its old policy of dividing Hindus through caste with new vigour. The Congress attempted this in Gujarat as well. Similarly, Congress leaders in Karnataka are trying to divide Hindus on the basis of religious practices, supporting Veera Shaivites as non-Hindus. Meanwhile, Rahul and Congress continue stoking leftist sentiments, allying themselves with communist parties and student unions like those of Jawaharlal Nehru University. Rahul only displays his Hindu appearance when required. Otherwise he is happy to be part of the far-left and support anti-Hindu agendas, particularly hatred for Brahmins. Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal is now following the same strategy. Can such old strident anti-Hindu leaders draw enough of the Hindu vote in order to stay in power, without changing their anti-Hindu policies? That is the question. Can they get the voters to forget their charges of saffron terrorism and their excusing of jihadi activities? Over these issues looms the shadow of UP and with it the issue of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. So far, the Congress has not changed its stand on the   and Rahul has not made any statements on whether the party is still opposed to building the temple and laments the loss of Babri Masjid. The problem for the Congress is that its leaders have long provided legal support for those against the temple, and long castigated Hindus who support the Ram Mandir as communal, anti-secular, if not fascist. On Ayodhya, the party continues to follow anti-Hindu policies of the communists and leftists. A reversal on this issue would be difficult to explain, yet without it any Hindu support for the Congress remains doubtful. Meanwhile, PM Modi remains committed to promoting Indian interests globally and expanding development inside the country as well. The main problem he has to face is that the entrenched Congress ecosystem in the Rajya Sabha, courts and bureaucracy continue to resist change and improvement, particularly now that their graft and black money sources have been cut off. The Congress is promoting a hate Modi campaign, and trying to create as much confusion and mayhem as it can in society. Apart from its few pro-Hindu gestures, the Congress is now looking more like a new version of the Aam Aadmi Party with Rahul Gandhi as the new Arvind Kejriwal, promoting anarchy in the name of resisting oppression. The stature of Modi continues to tower over such immature attempts at political disruption and will likely dominate the future. But expect a year of political theatre, shifting and contradictory views, with anti-Modi stunts and antics covering over a lack of policy or leadership by the Opposition. The Hindu card will be used to capitalise on all sorts of social divisions and consistent attempts to create confusion and disruptions will be made. Yet it is likely that the \"new Congress\" will meet the same fate as the AAP.

She was apparently feeling suffocated and frustrated with the Yameen government particularly since her father, Maumoon Gayoom, a former president who ruled Maldives for over three decades, was arrested recently on orders of his half-brother President Abdulla Yameen on criminal charges.   \r\n \r\n Though  has said in her resignation letter that she hasn't joined the Opposition, the development is bound to bolster the Opposition which has been at its wits’ end in dealing with the increasingly autocratic President Abdulla Yameen. Despite her caveat of not joining the Opposition, she has expressed concern about the state of democracy, judiciary and institutions and called upon the international community to help getting all these back on rails. \r\n \r\n This has been the consistent demand of the Maldivian Opposition for quite some time. Obviously, it means that the Opposition has got a shot in the arm and Dunya is firmly in the Opposition camp despite her feeble caveats to the contrary. Dunya Maumoon’s resignation came hours after it surfaced that India had offered to Maldives to participate in the  , to be held in Port Blair early next month, but the Maldives government declined the offer - a clear snub to India by Maldives ostensibly at the behest of China. Although Maldivian authorities have \"explained\" to India that under the current circumstances when the island nation has been under a state of emergency, it wasn't possible for Maldives to participate in the naval exercises as the Maldivian defence forces were on a standby to deal with any exigency. The Maldivian government’s rejection of the Indian offer to join the Milan exercises is being looked upon in the Indian strategic establishment as the Yameen government’s latest snub to India. It has been quite clear in the past few months that Maldives has flown out of the Indian orbit and flown into the Chinese sphere instead. It was demonstrated a few months ago when Maldives had signed its first-ever FTA with China, leaving India high and dry despite the Yameen government’s repeated assurances to New Delhi about its India-first policy. Maldives’ rapid drifting away from India and its China embrace came into sharp focus once again after news reports emerged in the Indian media that China was at the cusp of getting a military base in Maldives by way of Beijing establishing a joint ocean observation station in Maldives’ Makunudhoo, which is not very far from India. India, though seething with anger over the recent developments in Maldives, cannot do much to reverse the tide under the current circumstances. An Indian military intervention, sought by Opposition leader and former Maldivian president Mohammed Nasheed, is out of question. It's not just because of Chinese warnings, but essentially because of well-established principles of Indian foreign policy of not intervening in domestic affairs of a foreign power unless a specific request is made by the government of the troubled country. Moreover, since the nightmarish experience of Indian intervention in Sri Lanka when the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi sent Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka, it has been the unwritten principle of India not to embark on military missions abroad. Under the circumstances, the only doable option before India is to work through the United Nations route. In this context, the following initiative of an international body bells with the Indian scheme of things.  , the law association for Asia and the Pacific comprising of national bar associations and law societies in the United Nations ESCAP Region, has just decided to establish a fact-finding team for the purpose of ascertaining the situation with regard to: 1) The independence of the judiciary in Maldives 2) The independence of the Judicial Services Commission, and the transparency of  the process for appointment of judges and investigations of complaints regarding judicial conduct 3) The independence of the legal profession, and whether members of the legal profession are able to perform their professional duties unhindered and free of harassment or intimidation 4) Due process in the administration of justice in the Republic of Maldives 5) The rule of law and rights-related issues. The LAWASIA fact-finding team, led by its president Christopher Leong, is an independent team with an objective mission which is not to be sponsored by any parties, organisations or individuals from Maldives. This initiative is in response to the Maldivian foreign ministry's February 7 statement which said: “Maldives would like to invite its development partners and representatives from international organisations and associations to visit Maldives to assess the situation and witness the safety and security of Male, for their own citizens as well as to engage with the Government and key stakeholders in the country.” India will be backing the LAWASIA Initiative to the hilt, knowing full well that initiatives like these can bring more fruits quickly than the efforts of the marginalised Opposition.","title":"Why deepening Maldives crisis should worry India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/maldives-india-snub-milan-naval-exercises-abdulla-yameen-gayoom-dunya-maumoon/story/1/22604.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15256},{"author":"Praveen Shekhar","content":"A meeting of the  that was held in Paris concluded on February 23. During a plenary session of the FATF meet it was decided that Pakistan should be put on the \"grey list\" again to keep a watch on the rogue nation for not complying with the norms to check financing of terrorism. Over the next four months, Pakistan is expected to comply with certain stipulated conditions failing which it will find mention in FATF's formal statement. The neighbouring country was on the watch-list between 2012 and 2015 but only for money laundering. This time, however, Pakistan will be monitored for its compliance with anti-money laundering and Combating Finance of Terrorism regulations. FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989. Its objectives are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering,   and other threats to the international financial system. The Unites States worked behind the scenes during the Paris meet to ensure action against Islamabad, which Washington believes has not kept its promises on combating terrorism. All 39 member countries of FATF, barring Turkey, supported the US proposal against Pakistan. Even Pakistan's allies - China and Saudi Arabia - withdrew their objection to the move for punitive action. \r\n \r\n The decision at FATF has sent out an encouraging signal. The message that had gone out it that even if some countries do not see eye to eye on certain issues, combating terrorism was a common cause. This is the first time that China has supported India's stand and not backed Pakistan at a global anti-terror forum, thus landing a crippling blow to Islamabad's financial credentials. India is high on hope after China isolated Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. However, India does not need to be over ecstatic about the development. The reason is simple. China's stand at the FATF meet was backed by its own considerations. Remember, China is itself a victim of terrorism in the Xinjiang province. Today, if China doesn't join the global fight against terror, it may find itself isolated in tackling the menace on its own territory in the future. Also, China's brotherly love for Pakistan hasn't waned. The signs of this love are not just reflected in the Chinese investments in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the One Belt One Road Initiative. It goes much beyond that. Being on the grey list would mean that Pakistan's transactions are closely monitored. This would further cripple the country's economy as companies across the world would hesitate from doing business with Pakistan. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank too would avoid giving loans to Pakistan. In January, US President Donald Trump publicly raised concerns over Pakistan's reliability and integrity. His first tweet of 2018 put Islamabad in the cross hairs for its \"lies and deceit\". And on January 8, the US   to Pakistan over what it saw as a failure by the Pakistani government to adequately clamp down on terror groups within its borders. Every time pressure to act against terror is increased, Pakistan tries to rein in on terrorist organisations operating along its borders with Afghanistan, but it continues to target India. This pressure on Pakistan should continue till it changes its attitude and stop providing safe heavens to terrorists on its soil uniformly.","title":"Why Pakistan on FATF list is no reason for India to rejoice","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pakistan-fatf-terror-financing-china-india-pakistan-ties-donald-trump/story/1/22603.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15257},{"author":"Gautam Benegal","content":"The first page of the website of   - a project of the RSS’s health wing Arogya Bharati that is now providing parents with a kit that includes 10 CDs and books with mantras from ancient Indian texts to be used by expecting mothers - welcomes us with the following words: “Garbha Sanskar is not a new concept in India. Today, science has proved that intrauterine baby cannot only listen, touch, feel but also can respond on its own. More than 60 per cent intellectual development occurs in intrauterine phase. Garbhasanskar - are special scientific procedures performed to stimulate baby’s senses genteelly, because during intrauterine phase, cortical development is maximum. Health, body built, Intellect, talent all depends upon mother’s prenatal care. Mind, body and intelligence are synchronised and these have special value in life.” This reasonable scientific elucidation soon segues into the area of pseudoscience which the RSS is notorious for. (And out goes the grammar too as it warms to its theme.) “You can invite divine souls to take birth as transition phase is going on. Spiritually during this time, all the divine souls are keen to take birth. Divine souls come with good learning to perform good acts in this world. Hence, are constantly looking for the right parents, perfect environment where they are groomed in such a manner so that they can continue with their noble work which may be purpose of re-birth.” Therefore, the couple has to increase the good karmic level to such an extent that the divine soul chooses it to be its parents. Since all this is possible only during the pregnancy phase which we strongly believe is one of the most important, precious and delicate phase in the lifetime of any mother. People who follow our most advanced garbh sanskar antenatal classes sincerely get desirable results.” Among others, the Jamnagar-based centre has what they describe as “medical astrologers, yoga and music experts” in their team of consultants. Says the kendra’s manager, Rekha Gaur. “Every parent wants to have a good quality baby. Parents want their child to be bright and smart. But how can that be achieved? The answer lies in our sanskriti (culture) and values… If the parents want their child to be like Shivaji Maharaj, Rana Pratap or Aryabhata, then they will be provided with necessary suggestions. There is a whole range of sanskar prakriya (ritualistic procedure). There are different procedures if someone wishes to have a fair and tall baby or a smart and intelligent baby.” The RSS' love for a race which is of “fair” complexion is part of its ideological heritage that Indians are Aryans; fair, tall, honourable, respectable and noble who speak Sanskrit. RSS stands for Aryan supremacy and believes that only Hindu Brahmins of north India are from that stock. The most prominent ideologue of RSS, Guru Golwalkar, while addressing a gathering of faculty and students of the School of Social Science of Gujarat University on December 17, 1960, shared the wisdom that Namboodri Brahmins from north India were sent to Kerala to improve breed of Hindus there. According to him: “Today experiments in cross-breeding are made only on animals. But the courage to make such experiments on human beings is not shown even by the so-called modern scientists of today. If some human crossbreeding is seen today it is the result not of scientific experiments but of carnal lust. Now, let us see the experiments our ancestors made in this sphere. In an effort to better the human species through cross-breeding the Namboodri Brahamanas of the north were settled in Kerala and a rule was laid down that the eldest son of a Namboodri family could marry only the daughter of Vaishya, Kashtriya or Shudra communities of Kerala. Another still more courageous rule was that the first off-spring of a married woman of any class must be fathered by a Namboodri Brahman and then she could beget children by her husband.” The RSS' belief of Aryan superiority has been borrowed from Hitler and his Nazi Party of Germany. Adolf Hitler even before becoming chancellor of Germany was obsessed with ideas about race. He believed in racial “purity” and in the superiority of the “Germanic race” which he described as Aryan “master race.” He declared this Aryan race must remain pure in order to rule the world one day which was not far away. According to Hitler, the ideal “Aryan” was blond, blue-eyed, and tall. According to Dr Hitesh Jani, convenor of Arogya Bharati, another offshoot of RSS which is part of the project, “If the proper procedure is followed, babies of dark-skinned parents with lesser height can have fair complexion and grow taller”. When Golwalkar’s fascination with Hitler came up  for discussion in the Rajya Sabha on May 6, 2002,  the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee dismissed Golwalkar's openly fascist views as \"his own ( )'' and added that the BJP had \"nothing to do with the book (   )'' and that his party \"had never given its stamp of approval  nahin lagayi)\", which was, of course, as untruthful as the undertaking of the RSS to Sardar Patel that it would remain a \"social organisation\". Yet Golwalkar’s “apne vichar” keeps coming back like a bad penny, and this time around with government collusion. The next counselling sessions to create Übermensch Hindus like the Nazi Lebensborn project, are slated to be held in Kolkata, Rohtak and Gurgaon. The RSS has set a target by 2020 to have thousands of ideal infants on the production line. So, what are these ancient and venerable texts that will have little Rana Prataps and Shivajis gamboling around our Elysian fields of the future? Here’s an example from the Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad in its fourth section which describes the Putramanthanamantra rites by which a house-holder can get a worthy son or a worthy daughter. ( verse 6-4-17) If the husband and wife wish that a daughter should be born and that she should be learned and live full term of life, they should prepare rice cooked in sesame and they should eat with clarified butter. Then they will fulfil their desire.\" Here’s a passage from the Ayurvedic astrological conception chart calculation: “The lagna of the conception chart is the seventh from the child’s janma lagna. That which was the seventh house of the conception chart becomes the lagna [or navamsha lagna] of the individual. There is a great revelation hidden in this technique. The seventh house of the conception chart shows the mental and emotional qualities between the parents at the moment of creating the individual.

Its initial success in 2013 was seen as a voters' lapse, a bad judgement of the electorate which should have chosen the more experienced and settled political parties like the Congress and the BJP. This triangular contest has continued since then. The   just can’t accept the AAP style of politics. The systematic building of mohalla clinics, linking these clinics to hospitals, the revamping of government schools, a host of measures for the poor, including free and cheap potable water, subsidised electricity, more systematic mosquito eradication, anti-drug campaigns and a host of other measures. The mainstream parties despite their longevity failed to seize the potential of these and other measures. They and the Delhi administration took the opportunity of AAP not having a stable majority in the Delhi Assembly to postpone the Assembly elections towards the end of 2015. Despite this gambit, the AAP came to power with 67 Assembly seats out of 70 - with the BJP getting only three seats and the Congress none. This, the Opposition found horrible. Triangular politics became even more vicious and outlandish. The established political class’s dictum became \"when in doubt attack the AAP\". This vitriol was poured against the AAP because in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 in Varanasi, where Narendra Modi was the candidate, the AAP came second and the Congress a poor third. The AAP had become a threat to the political establishment. After this, the anti-AAP campaign became a torrent of abuse, slander, administrative intervention and even extra-judicial attacks on the AAP. Arvind Kejriwal was pilloried for staging a dharna near the Republic Day parade. Didn’t Mahatma Gandhi stop the collection of precious salt at the end of the Dandi March? Didn’t he intervene, or near, into a host of events in South Africa and India? Did anyone, excluding the Sangh Parivar, claim that what he was doing was anti-national? And did Kejriwal actually disrupt Republic Day celebrations? Clearly, Kejriwal’s stated intention was to demonstrate without disruption. But the mass of the media never forgave him. It is instructive to remember that, unlike the Press Council, the electronic media is virtually uncontrolled, or to put it differently, carefully primed to attack forces inimical to the interests of the media channels and their owners. In the past few days, on an “attack” channel, I heard the participants, including the anchor, referring to Kejriwal as a “Maovadi” and a \"Talibani\". My objections were heeded in the first case, but ignored in the second. Tragically, the media believes that anything goes, if it suits the interests of the channel, its owners and supporters. Thus, the term “fake” news. The role of the police cannot be understated. After the confusion and altercation with the  , the Delhi Police searched Kejriwal’s residence. Could it have done so in the case of a Union minister? The CM is the head of the Delhi government. Unfortunately, this has become commonplace. For example, after a political debate in JNU in February 2016, three students, including Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested and accused of treason. The courts threw the case out. But even after two years, the chargesheet against these students has not been submitted. Or when months later, Kanhaiya was beaten up by lawyers in the presence of the police, police commissioner BS Bassi denied any violence. But the doctors of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital found injuries on Kanhaiya’s body. This is what politicians have done to the police - the politicisation of the police, generally at the behest of politicians and powerful interests. The several police actions against the AAP and idealistic students and youth, obviously goes against the grain of the ideals of the freedom struggle, and the Constitution. This is what the major political parties and vested interests have come to. Will matters improve when passions cool? Highly likely. The mixture of political partisanship, an attack-media, a hostile Union government, an administration under pressure, are not matters and influences that can just wither away. But it should be remembered that administrators also work under difficult circumstances. Kejriwal will remember how a senior IAS officer advising him was picked up by the Delhi Police. Different actions for different people. The AAP has a tough ask. But he and the AAP have faced many challenges. They are here to stay, backed by a huge mass of supporters.","title":"Why India's political elite can't accept AAP's grassroots politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-arvind-kejriwal-maovadi-delhi-chief-secretary-anshu-prakash-bjp-congress-police/story/1/22527.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15259},{"author":"Seema Guha","content":"China and India the two major Asian powers have a complex relationship.   has already arrived on the world stage as a major economic and military power bent on reshaping the world its way. India is equally ambitious but as a chaotic democracy, it has not matched China's economic or military might. India knows that as a big populous nation it too has the potential to be a future global power. What is more, the US, concerned about Chinese dominance is willing to help India's growth to balance the regions power equation. The strategy to balance China by giving India a leg-up began during the George W Bush administration and is now being rigorously backed by President Donald Trump. However unlike India, Chinese planning is long-term. Beijing thinks through and meticulously plans its goals. Before embarking on its ambitious foreign policy goals, Deng Xiaoping the great reformer concentrated on the economy. China also settled all its boundary disputes with its neighbours, with the notable exception of India. Deng famously advised his people, to keep their heads down and work towards lifting the living standards of the Chinese. Having done that, China is now ready to take on the world under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, one of China's most powerful leaders. The nineteenth Congress of the CPC (Communist Party of China) was a coming out party for Xi Jinping's China. It is now the second-largest economy in the world. It is also a military power with a blue water navy. It is spending billions on research concentrating on artificial intelligence, gearing the nation to be at the forefront of cutting edge technology. Chinese submarines and ships are present both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. President Xi Jinping is consolidating and building on Deng Xiaoping's vision of opening up China to the world. While it is expanding its presence across Asia and Africa, (it also has a military base in Djibouti, east Africa), China is looking at being the number one power in the world. It is still far from closing the gap with the US, and knows on its way to become a super power it needs to first dominate Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. So the hectic activity in the South China Sea and expansion into the Indian Ocean sphere. China is also now playing hardball in India's immediate neighbourhood. Xi's ambitious belt and road and maritime initiatives is part of a larger plan to spread its influence across the globe. It is but natural that India and China, the two Asian neighbours eye each other's development warily and \"circle\" each other's periphery. The unresolved border problem between India and China, and PLA's frequent incursions, including the recent   as well as its heavy presence in India's immediate neighbourhood has added to the fear of China pushing into India's sphere of influence. India too has been stepping up its ties with Japan as well as all ASEAN countries. In fact, this Republic Day leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations - Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Philippines, Laos and Cambodia accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to be in Delhi to celebrate not just India's Republic Day but also to mark 25-years of India-ASEAN dialogue partnership. The ASEAN group, which has thriving trade with China, is still wary of Beijing and wants India to play a greater role in the region. ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei also have problems with China's claim to the entire South China Sea and the islands dotted across the waters as its own. But China's footprints are much larger in India's backyard. In the past, Pakistan was the only South Asian nation which had close ties with China. But now China has won not just a toe-hold but a foothold in several countries in India's neighbourhood. Pakistan is now a central piece of China's belt and road project. Beijing is investing $60 billion in developing infrastructure around Gwadar, a port China built in Pakistan's Balochistan province. China has already begun using Gwadar for its exports and is likely to deploy a contingent of the PLA to guard its interests there. In Nepal too, China is becoming a pivotal force. Like all small nations, India's neighbours have often used the China card against India. Nepal's new  , known to be close to China,   after the elections: \"We have great connectivity with India and an open border.., but we can't forget that we have two neighbours. We don't want to depend on one country or have one option.\" He explained that Nepal needed this to get leverage in dealing with India. India's foolish decision in 2015 of an unofficial blockade in Nepal, following a Madhesi agitation, soured ties between the two countries. While a pro-India government with Oli at the head is in power in Kathmandu, a China friendly leader is also in place in the Maldives. In Male, President Abdulla Yameen has cracked down on democracy, thrown opposition leaders in jail, and declared an emergency. While India, The US, the UK Britain and the rest of the world have condemned Yameen, China has lent support. It has also warned India against interference in the neighbour's politics. Maldives has signed a Free Trade Agreement in December 2017 with China and has invested hugely in building infrastructure. Chinese vessels regularly stop in the Maldives raising fears of a strong naval presence there. Whether in Sri Lanka, or Myanmar or even Bangladesh, China is present all along India's neighbourhood and beyond. Border talks between Bhutan and China, long in cold storage will begin now, perhaps with Doklam in mind. China is slush with funds and India cannot match its efficient infrastructure building. Delhi should concentrate on its strengths, which is institution building. Repeating its good work in Afghanistan, it should go for smaller projects which can make a difference on the ground and directly help people. The rewards in Afghanistan have been rich. It has continued in training officials. Both Japan and the US have come forward to work with India on building connectivity both in Asia and Africa. All this is good politics. The fact that India's ties with the US are thriving is being watched with some concern in China. The need of the hour is to keep working in the neighbourhood, which has both cultural affinities with democratic India as well as excellent people to people contact. India and China will not go to war, the stakes are heavily loaded against a repeat of 1962. There is little reason to panic, but it is important to work on India's strengths. India should deepen its engagement with Pakistan instead of resorting to foolish measures such as   from across the border from working in India. This does not reflect the real Indian culture. Reaching out to the people of Pakistan bypassing the government and the Pakistan Army would have helped India's diplomatic prospects in the region.","title":"India must reach out to all neighbours, including Pakistan, to counter China","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-china-relations-pakistan-maldives-pakistan-army-india-pakistan-relations/story/1/22540.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15260},{"author":"Romita Datta","content":"\"Even roadside telebhaja shops can be a good venture.\" This is what Mamata Banerjee said in February 2015. She was talking about how a tea kiosk, a sweetmeat shop or a telebhaja joint can be considered business options by the unemployed youth of Bengal. She, however, desists from giving the unemployment figures for the state. The telebhaja suggestion plopped in the scene three years before Prime Minister Narendra Modi could cook up the pakora lines, the scent of which is wafting a spicy controversy among the jobless youth of the country. Borrowing a line, frequently borrowed from Gopal Krishna Gokhale by a contemporary Bengali political stalwart, this is a clear case of \"what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow\".Not only this, there are multiple instances of NDA-led Centre thinking on the same lines as the government in Bengal. Sadly, no credits are being attributed to the Bengal chief minister. The BJP is not even ready to acknowledge that \"great men\" think alike and fools seldom differ. Take the case of Kanyashree - the state scheme aimed at empowering girls with a handsome stipend for pursuing higher studies instead of getting married at a young age. It was launched in 2013, exactly two years before PM Modi's \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao\". Though controversy and confusion refuse to die as to which came first - the egg or the chicken - the fact remains both are similar in their intent. The BJP might be claiming that BBBP is a better and more comprehensive policy bringing under its ambit the urgency to stop female foeticide, but the reality is that Kanyashree, being the first of its kind in stopping child marriage and school dropout, has won the hearts of the world winning Mamata the prestigious UN Public Service Day award for it in 2017. The recent spat over Kanyashree and BBBP between the governor of West Bengal Kesri Nath Tripathi and Mamata and her cabinet cronies is again a clear indication that neither is willing to give credit to the other. While Mamata thinks Kanyashree is unmatched in its scale and magnitude - Rs 5,000 crore as against Rs 100 crore yearly for BBBP, the Bengal governor thinks the constant drum-beating for Kanyashree is taking the wind or due credits away from Modi's scheme. Another example of thinking on similar lines is the much-touted Modicare, which is straight out of Mamata's Swasthyasathi - a health protection insurance coverage of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh (in case of critical illness) per year for 55 lakh people, rolled out in 2016. Modicare may be a magnified Swasthyasathi, involving 10 crore families and 50 crore people, but Swasthyasathi covers 1,900 ailments, treatment of which can be done in all government and 500 notified private hospitals. Both ambitious projects, however, have not taken into account the deficiency in infrastructure and the acute crisis of medical personnel. In Bengal, there is a shortfall of 33 per cent medical officers and doctors in the Directorate of Health Services and the picture is more or less similar across the country, where the doctor-patient ratio is 0.6:1,000. The thread of commonality runs beyond schemes and policy. Both do not bother about plurality of opinions in a democracy, majority of their decisions are arbitrary, their exclusive brainchild. Both are sensitive to criticisms, and reflect a poor sense of humour when the guffaw is on them, whereas they can choose to be extremely critical, often nasty, when it comes to pinning down somebody.When it comes to muscle-flexing, one struts around flaunting his 56-inch chest with a \"Big Brother\" attitude, the other prides in being a tiger, the royal Bengal tiger, who cannot be cowed down by agencies and the high-handedness of the Centre. And talk of connecting with people, Modi's \"Mann Ki Baat\" and \"Pariksha Pe Charcha\" draw resonance from Mamata's administrative meetings in the district, where apart from bureaucrats, students and commoners cannot just listen, but also participate. Mamata and Modi share a lot in common. They connect well with the masses, Mamata with her \"ma-maati-manush\", and Modi with \"mitron\". Being completely immersed in work, hardly dedicate anytime for their families. Both follow a strict and simple diet plan, and are committed to staying fit. Their handling of the press, and their ability to decimate the Opposition are much the same. Despite their similarities they appear as different as chalk and cheese. However, their careers have the same story of sweat, blood, humiliation and painstaking struggle. Their stories underline the rise and rise of common men without the backing of a political dynasty - the almost fairytale-like saga of rags to riches of a chaiwala and a woman, who sat at Haringhata Milk booths to deliver milk bottles. So close and yet so far - as Elvis Presley would sing.

The sleepy town boasts of an impressive sex ratio as well as literacy rate. However, it's not known for these reasons but for one man –  . Even though Haasan has spent very few years in Paramakudi, the impact that his family has had on the lives of the people here is immense.  The actor's ancestral house is now owned by Thamilarasu, a physical education teacher and, needless to say, a die-hard Haasan fan. “This is the biggest blessing in my life. I own the house in which Kamal sir too spent some years,” says the physical education teacher. The Thamilarasu family couldn't be happier to be in the spotlight even as their hero is set to  later today (February 21).   The family maintains the house like a shrine and have tried to keep important features of the house unchanged - for instance, the entrance door as carved by Haasan’s father D Srinivasa Iyengar, a painting by elder sister Nalini. “We didn’t want to change anything in the house, but some of them were too old and had to be replaced,” said Reeta, Thamilarasu’s wife. As visitors and fans come knocking on their door to see the house where Kamal Haasan once lived, the Thamilarasu family is more than happy to oblige them. “So many visitors come here, even tourists from Singapore and Malaysia. All his fans can't get enough of the place. Some touch the door, feel the walls, and even kiss the floor, as if it's a temple. It fills the heart with so much joy to see their love and devotion for Kamal sir.” The family’s allegiance towards Haasan knows no bounds. Thamilarasu, who was earlier an active member of Kamal Haasan Fans' Association, once had to spend a day in jail \"fighting\" for a Haasan’s film. He, however, describes the incident as one of the greatest achievements of his life. What's more, until 2014, the electricity bill for Thamilarasu's house used to come in the name of Haasan’s father. Thamilarasu couldn't muster the \"impertinence\" to get the name changed. Recollecting a tough phase in Haasan’s life and how he was able to do his bit, Thamilarasu says: “After the   controversy, Kamal sir had announced that he would leave the country. That time I sent him my house key and said the house still belongs to him. He  doesn't have to go anywhere. I requested him to come back here. Kamal sir still has a key to the house. He  even thanked me in his article in  .”   The sleepy town of Paramakudi not just has \"the honour of hosting\" the actor's ancestral house, but the people here also take immense pride in a primary school that was built by Haasan in his father's memory. While the people of Paramakudi have always loved the well-natured Srinivasa Iyengar and his son Kamal, who put the small town in the world map because of his cinematic skills, the locals here including close family friend advocate G Gopal are confident of his success in politics as well. “I'm sure he must have taken this decision long back and is the right person to join politics. Paramakudi will support him whole-heartedly.\" Despite caste considerations in Tamil Nadu politics, like everywhere else across the country, Paramakudi residents feel the people across the state will embrace their reel hero in their real lives too with open arms. \"Caste and community don't matter… Jayalalithaa was from a minority community. Most Tamil Nadu CMs were from minority community just like Kamal Haasan,\" says another confident Hassan fan. Meanwhile, Thamilarasu has a lot on his mind. He is even ready to quit his government job to go and help out his idol. “If Kamal sir asks me, I will quit my job and join him,” he says even as wife Reeta nods understandably. Kamal Haasan has a huge fan base that has been converted into a welfare association. It is known for carrying out various social welfare measures. The association is now working hard on a membership drive to enrol at least one lakh members before the actor enters electoral politics. While there is no dearth of fans, the question is whether the love of his \"devotees\" will make him a superstar in Tamil Nadu politics too.  ","title":"As Kamal Haasan launches party, this is what his home town Paramakudi expects from him","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kamal-haasan-party-launch-madurai-ancestral-home-paramakudi-fans/story/1/22471.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15262},{"author":"Akshaya Nath","content":"Born to D Srinivasa Iyengar and Rajalakhmi of Paramakudi town, Kamal Haasan might be one of the biggest superstars in Indian cinema, but for the people of Tamil Nadu, especially his hometown, he is still one among them. Paramakudi and its people love the man because of whom their little-known town is in headlines, as the superstar formally began his  today with the launch of Makkal Needhi Maiam. \r\n \r\n Although there are very few people left in his hometown who have personally known the family, every single one of them has fond memories of the enthusiastic, lovable young Haasan. Muthulakshmi, now in her mid-70s, was one of those people who played with Haasan when he was a child. Clad in a black and red sari, her voice changes as she starts recalling Haasan's childhood. “I was around 10 years old when he was a baby. He would never sit still, always up to something. He loved being carried around and I used to do that as they lived in the house next to ours. Aunty (Haasan's mother) used to pass him to me over the fence and I used to play with him.” Muthulakshmi also recalls how inspired by his sister, Haasan started learning dance and even participated in stage shows. Haasan was five years old when he made his debut as a child artist in   While it went on to become one of the best films of the time, young Kamal too received rave reviews for his performance.  “It was a superhit and all of us celebrated it in a big way here. He was our boy,” says Soundarajan, whose family used to run a hotel nearby. Haasan's father was a regular visitor. In fact, after the family initially moved to Chennai and Srinivasa Iyengar stayed back, it was Soundarajan’s Kuppanna Iyengar hotel where he would go to have his breakfast.   After entering showbiz, Haasan had to move to Chennai, something because of which he slowly lost touch with many back in his hometown. One of the last extended family members who still lives in Paramakudi is D Sowmyanarayanan. “I am the only person from the family here in Paramakudi now. Though we are all related, we hardly get to meet each other since most of them moved out of Paramakudi. Moreover, in absence of any elders, that common link is almost dead. I met Charuhasan and Subhashini [Maniratnam], Kamal’s brother and niece, at a wedding recently. But it has been a really long time since I last met Kamal.” But there are a few with whom the Haasan family continues to be in regular touch. Haasan’s neighbour in Paramakudi, advocate G Gopal, is one such person. In fact, the families still pay visits to one another. Talking about young Kamal’s love for cinema, Gopal says, “Kamal was in love with movies, as a child too. In fact, there was this MGR film,  , which ran for 100 days in Paramakudi, and Kamal had seen it every single day.” \"When he got his first ambassodor car, I was there at his Alwarpet residence in Chennai. Rajalakshmi Amma said ‘Gopalaa let’s go and take a ride'. Kamal’s mom and I were the first ones to sit in his car.”  Over the years these friends and well-wishers have turned into Kamal’s greatest supporters in public life too. In many occasions when he landed in controversies, they are were the first ones to lend their shoulders. One such recent incident was when Haasan was called “anti-Hindu” because of his remarks about sexism in   and even targetted him for his alleged Islamic faith.  “Kamal got the Haasan surname because of D Srinivasa Iyengar, who as a tribute to his friendship with Yaakob Haasan, with whom he briefly shared a prison cell during the freedom struggle, gave the surname to all his children. His father valued his friendships a lot,” adds Gopal.  The actor though in his interviews has given an alternative explanation too. According to him, Kamal means lotus and Haasan is derived from hasya, meaning laughter in Sanskrit.   As the man embarks on his political journey, the one aspect he is threading carefully and focussing on is the need for peace irrespective of religion, caste or creed. His friends and followers too believe so and are confident that caste and religion don't matter. “Bhaktavatsalam was a Mudaliar, Jayalalithaa was from a small Brahmin community. They too were from minority groups, but were successful. Kamal will also be able to make a difference,” says a confident Gopal. Sowmyanarayanan, who is at present a DMK supporter, proudly spoke about his cousin saying, “Kamal has brought big laurels to Paramakudi. He has made our small town visible in the national and international arena. I really hope his political career too touches similar heights.”  In Kollywood, Kamal Haasan is also known as Nammavar (a moniker that means \"our man\" given to the actor), and for the people he is indeed one among them. Haasan echoed the people's sentiments at the launch of his political outfit today, saying: “This is a party for you, for the people. I am your instrument, you are the leaders, this is a crowd full of leaders.”  ","title":"Makkal Needhi Maiam: What Kamal Haasan dedicating his party to the people means","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kamal-haasan-party-launch-makkal-needhi-maiam-tamil-nadu-party-of-the-people/story/1/22481.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15263},{"author":"Noam A Osband","content":"Last week, the United States had yet another school shooting, as 17 children were slaughtered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida by a 19-year-old with a long history of troubled behaviour. Of course, in the United States, a history of mental illness and violent tendencies is no barrier to getting a weapon capable of murder, so we have such tragedies. Indeed, under Donald Trump, the government has actually  restrictions on gun purchases by citizens with mental illnesses. Yet, while the United States’ gun culture doesn’t fit into any medical definition of mental illness, it is clear the US has a pathological relationship with guns. I didn’t always think United States’ gun culture was so sick. It often takes leaving home to truly understand a place, and I only fully appreciated the depth of United States’ obsession with guns after spending a year in England in my mid-20s. During that time, a shooter killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, then the United States’ record for the worst shooting in a single day. Sadly, in the United States’ tradition of excess and violence, we have since broken that record. And broken it several times. The shooting dominated the news, and it served as a topic of conservation for several days in the house. I explained the American conservative reaction to my housemates, and they were utterly incapable of understanding it. When I explained to many in my country school that shootings are a sign that gun laws are too loose and that instead we need better laws to protect people, they didn’t simply disagree. They seemed unable to understand how anyone could ever come to that conclusion. To them, it wasn’t a reasonable argument they disagreed with. Rather, they saw it as completely irrational, the logic of a lunatic. This was my first time having a sustained conversation outside the United States about my country’s gun policies, and I was seeing it through new eyes. Although I always disagreed with the notion that more guns means more safety, for me, it always had a coherence. The reaction of my roommates made me question that. It made me realise just how unhinged the United States’ gun culture is, how divorced it is from fact and reason, and how hard it can be to truly gain that perspective from within the country. The United States’ veneration of guns is dogmatic, hard-wired into our culture. The weapon is venerated in our movies, and   it at  . We are one of the   where gun rights are enshrined in the Constitution, and the only one of those countries where it is unrestricted. This devotion to the second amendment and its right to bear arms has all the trappings of religious dogma, a belief in a worldview that cannot be changed by empirical reality. In one particularly moving essay, Gary Willis  our love of guns to the worship of Moloch described in the bible, a deity whose followers sacrificed their children in devotion to their God. Perhaps, no greater sign of gun rights dogmatism, of the complete opposition to the empirical reality found by those who oppose modest gun control is the fact that, starting in 1996, the Congress  the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from studying the link between guns and public health. The CDC is the main government public health institution, and somehow they are forbidden from studying a tool that kills more than 30,000 Americans a year. Literally, more than one per cent of Americans die of  , yet the national government refuses to invest in studying this. It is no coincidence that the same side of American politics that irrationally refuses to acknowledge a link between guns and gun violence shows a similar incoherence with global warming — an unwillingness to engage in discussion about the deepening crisis. Sure, 17 children are dead but don’t comment on the tool of violence, lest you politicise the event. Yes, Houston is submerged under a biblical flood but don’t link it to the scientific consensus. Often, after these shootings, politicians say we need a renewed focus on treating mental illness, as if that is the variable that is the problem rather than the simple fact that the country has too many of these weapons of death. There are literally   in this country as there are people. People are people, and mental illness will always exist. Semiautomatic weapons however do not always exist, and they definitely don’t need to be sold to the public. Yet, until my country begins to accept the reality, to recognise that just as surely as the sun rises in the east, letting people collect innumerable and immensely powerful guns will result in death, we are destined to suffer more deaths. That’s reality. There has been one glimmer of hope this weekend. In the wake of the shooting, survivors of the attack have been engaged in a   of public activism over gun control. On Saturday, at a rally, Emma Gonzales, a survivor of the shooting, gave a speech that quickly went viral. At the end, she led a call and response where the crowd chanted “we call BS” on the idea that gun policy can’t lead to a decrease in gun deaths. In the age of fake news and delusion, when obvious facts are ignored with deadly consequences, it was inspiring to see students so clearly and boldly state to their older leaders that they will actively oppose their obvious lies. There is a simplicity and clarity to their call that is undeniable, and it gives me hope that perhaps more American politicians and voters, too, will begin to acknowledge the reality.","title":"Why United States takes its guns to school","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/florida-mass-shooting-kills-17-gun-control-us-second-amendment/story/1/22434.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15264},{"author":"Anand Kochukudy","content":"The   of Youth Congress block secretary, SP Shuhaib, is the latest in the long list of political   since half a century.

At around 11.15pm on February 12, a four-member gang arrived at a roadside eatery in a car and hurled two crude bombs. Two men with machetes pounced on Shuhaib and they hacked him repeatedly below his waist. The post-mortem report records 41 hack wounds, of which 37 were inflicted below his waist. The gruesome attack reminded Keralites of a similar barbaric attack on renegade Marxist TP Chandrasekharan in 2012 by cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A video of CPM flag-bearing activists airing death threats against Shuhaib has surfaced, pointing the finger of suspicion clearly at the ruling party in the state. The CPM workers' rant \"your days are numbered\" can be clearly heard in the video. Meanwhile, CPM's Kannur district secretary P Jayarajan had declared that they have nothing to do with the murder. (Similar declarations were also made in the wake of TP Chandrasekharan's murder by then state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan). With the surrender of two CPM members - Akash Thillangeri and Rijin Raj - following a search operation at \"party villages\" in Kannur, these declarations by senior leaders have been belied. What makes the latest murder stand out from the spate of murders in the last couple of decades is the fact that it has the potential to initiate a new wave of violence and drag Congress back into Kannur's murder politics. The Kannur feud, involving CPM and BJP/RSS since the 1980s, has dominated the discourse on the politics of murders as other parties such as the Muslim League and the Congress have gradually scaled down their involvement in violence. Congress, in particular, has completely abandoned it since 2000. While the party was in the thick of things in the 1970s, they have been on the sidelines of extermination politics since the 1980s despite remaining the primary Opposition party in the state and the district. Congress' Kannur face K Sudhakaran has begun a 48-hour fast from Monday and has warned of converting it into an indefinite hunger strike if the \"real\" culprits aren't arrested by then. Kannur's cycle of violence sustains on \"proxy culprits\" in which the parties involved present proxies in place of real perpetrators in connivance with police officers that ultimately leads to acquittals at the trial stage. Shuhaib was a protege of Sudhakaran and was also actively involved in religious and charitable activities of Sunni Students' Federation (SSF), the youth wing of AP Sunni faction. Incidentally, the AP Sunnis led by Kanthapuram Aboobackar Musaliar has always backed the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala and this murder spoil things altogether. What began as a local Kerala Students Union (KSU)-Students Federation of India (SFI) skirmish (Student bodies of Congress and CPM intensified when Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU)-the Marxist trade union arm-workers got involved). But how did it lead to such a brutal murder? Shuhaib's uncle Ismail reveals that his nephew was a CPM sympathiser, who moved to the Congress before 2015 though he never revealed the reason for that switch. Shuhaib had led the Congress' civic poll campaign in Edayannur and Therur wards in the CPM-dominated Keezhallur panchayat. With his influence in SSF, Congress won both wards. Congress won even without the backing of its ally Indian Union Muslim League in these wards - which rang alarm bells in CPM that enjoys dominance in these parts of Kannur. Apostasy is not taken lightly in Marxist strongholds and Congress' abandonment of extermination politics has seen a large number of ex-CPM cadres flocking to BJP/RSS and even vice versa. Ideology is secondary when it comes to such abandonments as the primary motive is to settle scores or self-preservation. Shuhaib's murder is also reminiscent of the , a Muslim League student leader in 2012 in Kannur. Incidentally, Thalassery MLA AN Shamseer owned up to the murder during a television debate. While CPM used the minority protection card in the 2016 Assembly elections, Shuhaib's murder may not go down well with many in the community. It has also come to light that an attack might have been planned on Shuhaib in   where rules are regularly flouted by political prisoners in connivance with police officials. When Shuhaib was arrested after a clash with CPM on January 13, the magistrate court ordered that he be lodged in the sub-jail for undertrials. But in an inexplicable move, he was swiftly shifted to the special sub-jail located in the Kannur central jail. K Sudhakaran had intervened with jail DGP R Sreelekha to shift him back to the sub-jail then. Shuhaib's father, Muhammed, was also aware of the threats to his son's life and has confirmed receiving such messages on his phone. Shuhaib was the sole breadwinner of his family comprising three sisters. The human suffering in Kannur's murder politics is often a neglected topic. Political murders have crippled many families in this district and while parties use them as \"martyrs\" to further their politics, the families are left to suffer. A few months back, BJP had unleashed a campaign nationally against the ruling CPM accusing them of spreading \"red terror\" in Kerala. People of Kerala were unanimous in thwarting the propaganda and were quick to point out that it wasn't a unidimensional issue. Marxists will have to come around the reality that extermination politics has no place in a civilised society in 2018. A lot of their omissions and commissions have been conveniently ignored over the years due to their utility in preventing the growth of communal politics in Kerala, where people live in complete harmony. But if these murders keep repeating every now and then under their rule, one will have to question their commitment to law and order. While they claim to have lost more people than the BJP/RSS since the 1980s, these arguments fall apart if we are to take into account the past two years alone of Vijayan's chief ministership. CPM has lost only three lives against seven on the other side in Kannur in this brief period. Chief minister Vijayan chose to remain mum on this ghastly incident for six days. He only spoke on February 18. It seems the transformation from being the ringleader of Marxist politics in Kannur to the people's chief minister hasn't been an easy one. But if the police choose to act as an extension of the party in this case (Kannur SP has upbraided his subordinates for leaking information to the party and has officially complained to the state DGP), a new wave of violence will be the natural consequence and Kerala can ill-afford setting the clock back.","title":"Killing of Youth Congress leader SP Shuhaib may spark a wave of violence in Kerala","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/political-violence-in-kerala-sp-shuhaib-communists-pinarayi-vijayan-kerala-kannur/story/1/22440.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15265},{"author":"Harsh V Pant","content":"Hassan Rouhani’s visit to Delhi was the first by an Iranian president in 10 years and it was much needed. His talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi were deemed substantive and the two leaders emphasised the need to build stronger relations. Modi suggested that the visit by the Iranian president underscored how the two sides want to deepen cooperation in key areas, including connectivity, even as Rouhani repeated his nation’s resolve “to combat terrorism and extremism”. A dozen pacts were signed including one on double taxation avoidance and another for the leasing by an Indian company of a container terminal facility in Iran’s Chabahar port. But the Indo-Iranian relations are facing some strong headwinds. Last month Donald Trump decided not to pull Washington out of a deal that it and other world powers made with Tehran to limit Iran’s nuclear programme. But he gave a strong warning to other countries in the deal. Make the deal tougher, or the US will stop keeping its end of the bargain with sanctions relief. At the same time, the Trump administration has imposed new targeted sanctions on 14 Iranian individuals and entities in connection with various human rights abuses. This was the same strategy that Washington adopted last year when it waived the sanctions but imposed sanctions on seven targets involved in Iran’s ballistic missile programme, including two senior Iranian defence officials, one of whom allegedly helps to arm Assad and a China-based network that allegedly supports Iran’s military by supplying millions of dollars’ worth of items used in missile production. The US president had informed the US Congress in October last year that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is no longer in the country’s national security interest, calling it the “worst deal ever”. But instead of scrapping the deal outright, he had put the ball in Congress’ court asking the legislators to modify the agreement even as his administration marshals international support to increase pressure on Iran. Defying Trump, the European Union made it clear that it would defend the agreement. Though European officials have tried for a unified response to Trump’s pulling out from the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord, strains have emerged within that threaten to weaken Europe’s common stance. The European Union has made it clear that it is not open for renegotiation. The British, French and Germans have been lobbying hard to keep the Trump administration in, arguing that the deal is working. As West Asia continues to pass through a phase of unprecedented churn, Iran has emerged as, perhaps, the most potent force in the region. The US is itself responsible for this as its removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, which had always been a strategic counterweight to Tehran, resulted in this situation. Tehran has been effective in leveraging the regional realities to serve its foreign policy agenda. With the Islamic State (ISIS) facing a regional retreat, proxy wars are underway in Iraq and Syria for a distribution of the spoils. Iran’s influence over the Shia-dominated government and many militia forces in Iraq has given Tehran unprecedented leverage in shaping the political future of Iraq. And in Syria, Iran’s sustained backing of the Assad regime has made the survival of the regime possible despite the challenge posed by the US-backed groups. With their position entrenched in Syria and their influence in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen secure, Iran and Hezbollah and their Shiite allies believe they have built a formidable, unified, border-spanning front. How they choose to exert their power could dictate the future trajectory of the wider West Asia. Israel and Iran are coming to blows in Syria. As a result, despite Trump’s threats, Iran is placed much better in the region than ever before. But tensions between Washington and Tehran constrain the strategic space for India in dealing with Iran. New Delhi has, therefore, welcomed the 2015 nuclear deal. Given the isolation facing Washington on its new Iran policy, India may not have to worry too much in the immediate future. In fact, what should be more worrying for India is the slow pace of the Chabahar port project, which has irked the Iranians, and they have indicated that despite India developing the project, it won’t be exclusive to the country. Pakistan and China might also be invited to get involved. Chabahar is seen as India’s answer to the Gwadar port, which will allow it to circumvent Pakistan and open up a route to landlocked Afghanistan. Bringing China and Pakistan in will be a challenge to Indian interests. Uncertainty surrounding American posture towards Iran is complicating India’s ability to deliver fast on Chabahar as Western manufacturers remain wary of supplying equipment for the Iranian port. The first phase of the project was completed and inaugurated in December but much more remains to be done before the project becomes the strategic nodal point that New Delhi perhaps wants it to be. The Indo-Iranian cooperation on Afghanistan is also coming under stress with Tehran joining Russia and China in managing Pakistan’s role in the region. The ISIS is viewed as the bigger threat in Afghanistan than the Taliban by these states. Though the larger trade and energy ties between India and Iran are gradually growing, they are being overshadowed by India’s growing stakes in the Arab world and Israel. The Iranian president’s visit to India has made a modest effort towards adding dynamism to Indo-Iranian ties. It remains to be seen how far this will go as a new power configuration emerges in India’s extended neighbourhood which India will have to navigate carefully.

For the common man what matters is that this mega scam has tumbled out of the closet during the Modi government. Therefore, this development will inevitably have some kind of negative impact. The million dollar question is whether the Modi government will bear political losses or will the Opposition reap some political benefits from this development? Well, the answer is in the womb of time and will be known upfront on March 3 when the results of   are out. Yes, the results of Nagaland and Meghalaya Assembly polls too will be out on that day but the BJP doesn't have much electoral presence of its own in these two northeastern states. Tripura results should serve as the answer, politically speaking, as the top leadership of the BJP is actively involved in these elections, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself. Ground reports suggest the BJP was well poised to give the CPM-ruled government of chief minister Manik Sarkar a run for its money. The BJP was seen as a serious contender with the potential to emerge victorious in the Tripura elections and end the 20-year-old rule of the Manik Sarkar government. But this was before the PNB fraud flew into the face of the BJP government at the Centre. PM Modi is adept at coining political catchphrases and words during election campaigns which have invariably cost the Opposition dear. Who can, for instance, forget his  in the middle of Uttar Pradesh elections which eventually pulled the carpet from under the feet of the Opposition and installed a BJP government with an unprecedented majority in India's most populous and electorally the biggest state - and that too a crucial swing state? PM Modi came up with a similar clever remark during Tripura election campaigning when he said this at a public rally: \"It is as if an astrologer has given you a Manik (gemstone) to wear and it has turned out to be the wrong Manik (read chief minister Manik Sarkar). So while the country developed, achhe din never came to Tripura. It is time to take off the wrong Manik and instead I offer you a HIRA - Highways, I-ways, Railways and Airways.\" He made this remark at an election rally in Sonamura, Tripura on February 9. Little did he realise that a crowning irony was waiting to happen with \"Hira\" (diamond) trader Nirav Modi rocking his boat in a big way. Thus his remark that the people of Tripura should shun \"Manik\" or gem (chief minister Manik Sarkar) and embrace \"HIRA\" (diamond) unintentionally turned ironical. Normally, national issues hardly dominate the agenda and outcome of state assembly polls, much less in context of the far-flung northeastern states. But Tripura, a traditional Left bastion where the BJP tried its hardest to dictate a new political narrative and change the political discourse, may well prove to be a different case altogether. Away from the glare of northeastern politics, the PNB fraud is likely to have an adverse economic fallout. It may compel rating agencies such as Moody's to downgrade India's ratings. It may also adversely impact the carefully nurtured image of the Modi government in terms of Ease of Doing Business and inflict political costs on the Modi government. The Opposition has already got hold of an important political stick to beat the Modi government with. The social media is full of derisive variations of PM Modi's  : \"Na khaoonga, na khaane doonga\" (I will neither indulge in corruption nor allow others a chance to be corrupt). The trending message on social media is: \"Na khaoonga, na khaane doonga; sirf bhaagne doonga\" (Won't indulge in corruption, won't allow others to be corrupt; but will allow the corrupt to escape).\" If the court   had come before Gujarat went to polls, the results (BJP 99, Congress 80) could have been different. But the PNB fraud case has panned out before Tripura polls. Cases like these have the potential to influence both national and state level politics. Whether the fraud impacts the Tripura polls remains to be seen. The Tripura results will determine whether the impact of national events on state Assembly polls is just a speculation or a stark reality. If despite this the BJP wins Tripura and unseats the ruling CPM, it will only go to show that Modi's Teflon image is still intact. A contrary result will prove the opposite. This, in turn, would mean that Modi's BJP would have a lot to worry about in its Mission 2019.","title":"How Nirav Modi swindling Punjab National Bank of Rs 11,000cr will impact Modi government","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-elections-nirav-modi-narendra-modi-bjp-lok-sabha-polls-pnb-fraud/story/1/22407.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15267},{"author":"Geeta Mohan","content":"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's   to India marks the beginning of a greater India-Canada cooperation. A global leader, who has become the face of free voice, diversity and unity, comes to India at a time when we are grappling with the issue of \"tolerance\". In the entire insider-outsider, us versus them debate, Trudeau has shone like a beacon of light for those who wish to see alleviation and elimination of such a vicious global environment. \r\n \r\n He has invited with open arms those who have been shunned in their own homeland, those who look to Canada for a brighter future, those who need space to be heard. Trudeau has been an answer to scores of Indians as well. In 2016 alone, around 40,000 Indian immigrants found home in Canada. Today the Indian community in Canada makes up for a significant vote bank and some have made it to Trudeau's cabinet. The reason why this visit is more important to Canada than maybe to India is the huge constituency Prime Minister Trudeau has to cater to back home, the huge Indian community, particularly from Punjab. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always considered the Indian community living overseas an important component of his foreign policy toolkit. As part of India's \"soft power\" policy, Indians living abroad have become \"influencers\". But Canada is a unique case where while we have Indian origin parliamentarians contending to become PM, we also have some members of the very same community supporting growing Sikh radicalism that is reviving the Khalistani movement in Canada. A matter of grave concern to India. One that has been raised by India at all official levels. India and Canada have grown leaps and bounds when it comes to trade, investment and the energy sectors although both agree there is room for more. But the area that we have lagged behind in is security and the strategic sphere. Do our interests converge? Are we on the same page when it comes to security concerns? Security isn't about regional and global arena. It starts from home. The questions that are being raised are whether both countries would be able to find a way to understand each other's concerns. India has made amply clear the impact this resurgence could have on India's security. But, Trudeau looks at the community as a celebration of cultures and peoples. He in fact attended an event in April 2017 in Toronto which had Khalistani flags and pictures of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a terrorist killed in action in Punjab, put up everywhere. Unaware or unconcerned of the sensitivity involved? There is a reason why Canadian leadership has tread very carefully in the past on the issue because the 1985 Kanishka bombing, which killed a total of 329 people, including 268 Canadians, 27 Britishers and 24 Indians; remains a reminder of the devastation such movements can cause. Canada might have moved on and away from this horrid past, but this continues to remain a part of the conversations between India and Canada. While India has been engaging Canada to look at the bigger picture and not get confined in petty political bickering, the fact is that there is more to the ties between India and Canada and hence the need to delink the \"Khalistan\" issue from the substantive part of our ties. India and Canada have many areas in which they can benefit from mutual cooperation. Trade, job creation, investment sector are just some of those areas. Apart from this, climate change, and counter-terrorism (every vote at the world body counts) are areas where the two countries can benefit by working closely. Canada has   India's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. There is much to gain for both the countries. But much more can be achieved if the leaders' can find common grounds on all issues. Canada will have to differentiate between \"diversity\" and \"extremism\" and India will have to make a distinction between \"freedom of speech and action\" and \"intolerance\" in the name of that same freedom.","title":"Can India and Canada use Justin Trudeau's visit to move beyond Khalistan","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/justin-trudeau-canada-khalistan-nsg-toronto-extremism-diversity/story/1/22408.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15268},{"author":"Asit Jolly","content":"Captain Amarinder Singh’s consistent refusal to engage with Sikh ministers within Canada’s federal government who were reported to have Khalistani leanings has forced the ministers to clarify their position. The denials by defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan and infrastructure minister Amarjit Sohi have been issued just days ahead of, and evidently prompted by, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s first state visit to India later this month. Reports in the Canadian media have quoted Sohi as saying that “he does not sympathise with the cause (Khalistan), nor does he hear much talk about it in the (Canadian) Sikh community.” Sajjan, who was refused an audience by the Punjab chief minister when he visited Chandigarh and Punjab last year (2017) because of his purported “Khalistani connections,” also refuted the charge as being “ridiculous.” The Canadian defence minister said in Ottawa: “I’ve been a police officer, I’ve served my country and any allegations like that is absolutely ridiculous and I find it extremely offensive as well.” Reflecting the growing political influence of the Sikh community in Canada, as many as 16 MPs of Sikh origin were elected in the federal elections in 2015. But this has been accompanied by a visible proliferation of Khalistani separatists, who have reportedly been employing North American gurudwaras to continue fuelling demands for “liberating Punjab from Indian domination.” In fact, there have been worrying reports of Khalistanis forcibly preventing Indian representatives and officials from entering gurudwaras in Canada. Police and intelligence officials in Punjab claim that Canada-based Khalistanis and their sympathisers contribute the largest chunk of illegal hawala funding that is being used to try and revive the moribund separatist movement in Punjab. Although Prime Ministers Trudeau and Narendra Modi appear to share a comfortable rapport and have met one-on-one on the sidelines of several international meetings, including most recently, the World Economic Forum at Davos, the free rein given to Khalistanis in Canada has cast a shadow on Trudeau's upcoming five-day visit. The trip, slated to focus on trade and cultural ties between the two countries, significantly includes a visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Commentators say, given that Indo-Canadians now number at 1.2 million, the India-Punjab visit could boost Trudeau’s prospects for re-election. Reportedly advised to make amends, Sohi has clarified his position: “If there is a small segment of people in Canada who talk about separation, who talk about the creation of Khalistan, if they do that in a peaceful way that is their right to do so but this is not an issue that I hear in the community,” the minister was quoted (in Canadian media) as having said in Ottawa. “From my point of view this is not an issue for the Canadian population, this is not an issue for the Indo-Canadian community within Canada, and I don’t feel it necessary to be engaging in something that is completely irrelevant from a Canadian’s point of view.” Quick to respond, Amarinder welcomed the clarifications by Sajjan and Sohi. “I congratulate Prime Minister Trudeau for creating the necessary environment against secessionist forces believed to be operating from his country,” the chief minister said. It’s typically Amarinder to take what may seem like a contentious position to many, and then stick to his guns. On a visit to Toronto during his earlier, 2002-2007, tenure as CM, Amarinder was accused of \"hob-nobbing with Khalistanis\". His rivals in the Shiromani Akali Dal quite literally went to town decrying his visit to a \"Khalistani\" gurudwara in Dixieland (Toronto). Local media in Punjab was flooded with pictures showing the chief minister standing below a \"Khalistan Zindabad\" banner while addressing a congregation inside the shrine. Unperturbed, Amarinder called a news conference in Chandigarh. “Any gurudwara is the home of my Gurus and I reserve the right to go there. hanging up nonsensical banners doesn’t change that and I will never be deterred from going to any gurudwara,” he told visibly surprised reporters who had come expecting long, convoluted explanations, even an apology?

Where were the two hundred thousand karsevaks that we were expecting? We smelt a rat. Was the press meeting hogwash then? Did the leaders have other plans up their sleeves? Upon reflection, I have felt that the Babri Masjid would have stayed intact if the plans were not changed at the eleventh hour. While the mosque was being destroyed and was falling like the wall of Jericho, we heard that it was Vinay Katiyar who pressurised the leaders of the movement against a symbolic karseva. He argued that repeated tokenism in the name of karseva would not go down well with the devotees who had been clamouring for action for a long time. Katiyar was the chief of Bajrang Dal. He had won the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in the 1991 general elections. He is a belligerent man, who does not mince words. When during the karseva in October 1991, a few young men scaled the dome of the Masjid, Katiyar had to face the wrath of the karsevaks in trying to dissuade them. This time round, he wanted a more concrete action plan that would satisfy his supporters. The karsevaks were in no mood to leave the Masjid premises and go to the banks of the Sarayu. When we reached the karseva venue, BP Toshniwal endorsed the changed plan. “It has been decided at the last moment that the karsevaks would congregate at the Rama Katha Kunj ground, from where they would be sent in small batches to the venue,” he said. In other words, they would be spared the long walk. The decision seemed justified and never did we anticipate that the assembling two hundred thousand karsevaks near the venue could be part of a bigger agenda, until around an hour later, when the first signs of lawlessness became visible. While we were talking to Toshniwal, the Rama Katha Kunj and its approach road were overflowing with karsevaks. RSS volunteers were manning the Rama Deewar with great alacrity. Ram Shankar Agnihotri, the loudmouth spokesman of the VHP, had informed us that a special arrangement for journalists had been made on the roof of Manas Bhavan, adjacent to the venue on its eastern side. But who would care for a seat in the stands when one could get a decidedly better view from the sidelines? I proudly displayed the pink press card given by the VHP and was promptly allowed by RSS volunteers inside the mosque premises. When I had come to cover the karseva in July, I noticed that the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh led by Kalyan Singh had changed the very look of the mosque premises. It had acquired 2.77 acres of land next to the mosque and levelled it. There was no sign of the spot which was the centre of dispute owing to the laying of the foundation stone of the temple in 1989. Instead, the July karseva aimed at laying the foundation of the main entrance of the temple designed by Sompura. The gate would be 166 feet long and 80 feet wide. Throwing the court order to the wind, the July karseva ended after the foundation was laid. The December karseva was meant to “cleanse” this foundation. A crowd of hardly 500 volunteers and sadhus greeted us at the site. A copper pot adorned with a vermilion swastika was shining in the morning sun, right in the middle of the site. All arrangements for an elaborate puja were complete, with the whole area decked up with mango leaves, garlands and flower petals. Acharya Bamdev was supposed to preside over the official karseva at quarter past twelve. That would mean that the sadhus would start the puja and cleansing of the platform while the karsevaks, in small batches, would fill the cavities with sand. Tej Shankar, the royally treated Supreme Court observer, seemed happy with the proceedings. The evening before, he had faxed the apex court that all was well and in keeping with the court’s directives. That is, no construction work was happening in the acquired land. One of the first to arrive at the venue was Acharya Haricharan Das of the Vaishnava sect of Chitrakoot and with him a teenaged sadhu who was a sight to behold. Wearing a turmeric-coloured dhoti tied like a lungi, Raghunandan had covered his upper torso with a namavali printed with “Hare Krishna Hare Rama” (a namavali is a shawl with names of gods printed on it). Every part of his body, the shaven head downwards was covered with the red of the tilak. The first thing he did after taking his seat was to bring out two shovels from his bag. Dharamdas, the six-and-a-half-foot tall sadhu, who was nearby, promptly held him by his neck and threw him out of the premises. It seemed that Dharamdas, the pehalwan who shadowed Katiyar wherever he went, was there to ensure that the court directive was complied with in letter and spirit. Certainly a teenaged sadhu had no business to defy court orders under his nose. Even as Raghunandan was trying to gather himself from the sudden assault, about 200 karsevaks were trying to elbow their way in. All of them were wielding trishuls. Many of the jawans of Provincial Arms Constabulary (PAC) had vermilion tilaks on their foreheads and even the RSS knew that they were hardly dependable. The RSS volunteers themselves formed the second line of defence behind these PAC jawans. One of them assured the police, “Don’t you worry. We’ll handle this”. The PAC jawans were only too happy to have this assurance. The PAC, a paramilitary outfit, formed during the regime of chief minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari, had never remained neutral during communal riots in the state. Every time a karseva took place in Ayodhya, the PAC stood behind the karsevaks openly. It would have been impossible for the karsevaks to break the security cordon and reach Ayodhya during the karseva of 1990, if the PAC had firmly stood its ground. The karsevaks’ happiness with the PAC was in equal measure of their unhappiness with the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force). The moment the PAC distanced itself from the scene, a scuffle ensued between the RSS volunteers and the karsevaks. A deluge of karsevaks kept lashing at the gate. Moments later, they were hounded away by the volunteers. The resistance lasted for not more than fifteen minutes. About 150 young men with trishuls and iron rods barged in at the site. The karsevaks went into a tizzy, gyrating with chants of “Jai Shri Ram”. This “Rama dance” which was a mixture of tandava, breakdance and disco, was also a by-product of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Maniram from Rajasthan was one of the revellers. His wafer-thin torso bore obvious signs of poverty, but that did not take away his zeal. He accosted me, looked into my eyes and my press card, and with a frightening frown yelled, “Jai Shri Ram”. I repeated the chant with him, something that I had learnt to do with experience. And then I asked, almost apologetically, “What about the court orders?” Moments later, I was surrounded by ten other karsevaks, spitting venom at the court and telling me in no uncertain terms that a media person would be better off by staying away from the scene. An RSS volunteer came to my rescue and with folded hands asked me to move away. Arguing would be foolhardy, I thought and moved to a nearby hillock that till the previous year housed the police control room. I saw Shrish Chandra Dikshit, former DIG of UP police-turned-BJP MP from Varanasi and vice president of the VHP, in a saffron cap, sitting on a brick. Giving him company were Uma Shankar Bajpai, DIG of Faizabad division, along with the leader of the almost non-existent Panther Party of Kahsmir, Bhim Singh, with his journalist wife, Sheela. Amid the din and bustle, Ashok Singhal entered the site from the Hanumangarh Road, accompanying Shiv Sena MP Moreshwar Save. A huge cheer of “Har Har Mahadev, Har Bhavani” greeted them. Singhal showed him around, as though Save was a VVIP. In about ten minutes came LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, both with grim faces. Joshi exchanged greetings with us and almost like a soliloquy said, “Let’s see what happens”. And then both the BJP leaders left, taking the approach road off Hanumangarh, to the roof of the VHP office in Rama Katha Kunj that was turned into a makeshift dais for the leaders after the crowd was shifted from the banks of the Sarayu. All the while, the number of karsevaks at the Sankat Mochan gate was increasing like floodwater. The RSS volunteers were now clearly being outnumbered and many of them were injured during the scuffle. Next to the gate were three metal detectors leading into three narrow lanes. This was the official route for the devotees to enter the structure housing the “Ramlala”. A few karsevaks chose to climb atop the metal detectors and were dangling their feet from above. Dharamdas was trying in vain to dissuade them. I suddenly found three journalist friends, Manimoy Dasgupta and Ashok Malik of   and SNM Abdi of  , beside me. “We have just surveyed the back of the mosque. A few hundred karsevaks with spades and shovels have assembled there. I have a fear that they will demolish the mosque today,” said a visibly frightened Abdi. “Do not read much into those preparations. Even if someone scales the tombs of the mosque, they will raise a saffron flag there and nothing more. Similar things happened last year on 31 October, CRPF jawans pulled them down,” I assured Abdi. Abdi’s worst fears came true, but at least, at that point in time, I had confidence on the political will and the discipline of the RSS leaders. I was proved wrong. I was smoking, a few too many cigarettes than I normally would. Shankar, a karsevak from Baramati in Maharashtra, the home turf of Sharad Pawar, came up and asked for a smoke. “It’s futile to lecture us on the court orders. Every time, we are being made pawns of a stupid political game. It’s now or never,” he warned. Even as we spoke, I saw a group of young men in yellow headbands rushing through the approach road gate. They were members of RSS’s Rapid Action Force. They pounced on the euphoric karsevaks and beat them out of the territory. A photo journalist, a foreigner, was trying to take snaps. “No photo, no photo,” screamed a few members of the RSS’s force. Some of them chased him. The poor man lost his balance and fell on some loose bricks. The RSS volunteers seemed teeming with confidence, having won this pitched battle. The battles went on for an hour. And the RSS volunteers were up against a formidable enemy, egged on by local leader Mahesh Narayan Singh. “Those who are combating us are not disciples of Rama. And neither are they karsevaks. They are plants of VP Singh, Mulayam Singh and Narasimha Rao. Do not fall into their traps,” he kept thundering. Dharamdas was at his job. He snatched a cane rod from a PAC jawan and started beating up the karsevaks mercilessly. Moments later, I saw him lying on the ground, with a few karsevaks sitting on him and beating him black and blue. Dharamdas was a wise man. He clearly saw this as a lost battle, somehow regained his foothold and ran away for dear life, clutching at his saffron dhoti. That was the final frontier that the karsevaks had to cross. With his exit, the floodgates were thrown open. Hundreds of karsevaks romped through the various entry points and, like a herd of wild bison, ran towards the mosque. I looked around and found no trace of Dixit or Bhim Singh or his wife. Geetha Siddharthan of the   was the only person other than me on the hillock. To my utter disbelief, I saw that two youths had scaled the middle tomb and were dancing away to glory. Even a moment before this, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar had no inkling of the madness that was happening at the karseva site. Sitting pretty on the roof of the VHP office, they mistook the battle sounds for some street brawl. The top leaders of the Sangh Parivar, Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Ashok Singhal, HV Seshadri, KS Sudarshan, Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Rithambara were enjoying the December sun and cracking jokes among themselves. It was a picnic alright. Seshadri and Sudarshan, two very influential leaders of the RSS, had been camping in Ayodhya for a week now. They had visited every camp of the karsevaks and explained to them in great detail the court orders and how important it was to maintain discipline. These leaders were confident that no one from the Sangh Parivar would dare defy them. And they were there in person to ensure that everything went smoothly. Although Advani reached the pinnacle of political success riding on the wave of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the BJP had done precious little for the cause before the summer of 1989. It was Ashok Singhal, the all-powerful general secretary of the VHP, who led the movement from the front. He got together sadhus from across the country and united them. Singhal nursed a grief within, as he was not so much in the limelight as an Advani or a Joshi was, but he was politically astute enough not to bring it out in the open. However, his attitude reflected his confidence and arrogance. He hated the so-called “pseudo-secular press” with all the contempt at his command. The two undisputed queen bees of the movement were Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Rithambara. Both were powerful orators and rabble-rousers who could address a captive audience for hours. In terms of popularity among the karsevaks, they were way ahead of Advani or Joshi. Uma reached Ayodhya a few days before December 6. Rithambara was seen on the spot only on that morning. Advani and Joshi came to Ayodhya from Lucknow where they addressed a rally along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Vajpayee, as was always his wont, did not participate in the karseva and went back to Delhi. It was anyway a big day for journalists, just to have all the top leaders of the Sangh Parivar on the same dais in an open arena. Vinay Katiyar was the man in charge. Clad in an impeccably creased white dhoti–kurta, he started off the proceedings at the stroke of eleven. Yugpurush Paramanand, the guru of Rithambara, explained how the karseva would be conducted. Ashok Singhal warned the crowd not to fall prey to the provocative stories that the media was writing about the karseva and not to breach discipline. As it happened, the crowd did not give two hoots about Singhal’s diktat on discipline but they certainly did take a cue from him on how to handle the press. Murli Manohar Joshi, the then BJP president whose journey to Ayodhya from Delhi proved disastrous, was visibly moved to see an ocean of humanity in front of him. In a trembling voice, he delivered a speech, the high point of which was a comparison of Arjun Singh, the Union human resource development minister with a eunuch. Rajmata Scindia was worse off. She could not hold back her tears of joy and could only say a small prayer that the temple be built. The Queen Mother of Gwalior, who had disowned her son Madhav Rao, had been a venerable figure in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In 1990, she tried to organise a large number of karsevaks to march to Ayodhya. Again in July 1992, when the sadhus were at a loss on how to react to the Supreme Court verdict against karseva, the Rajmata came to Ayodhya on behalf of the Sangh Parivar to appease them. Although she did manage to keep her daughter, Vasundhara Raje, in the BJP fold, the latter was not half as serious as her mother about the Ram temple. She was happy vacationing in Jaipur while the mother camped in Ayodhya. Even as the Rajmata was speaking, the war cry from the karseva site broke the quiet of the Ram Katha Kunj. All those who were cordoned off by RSS volunteers and were listening to the leaders stood up. Not that much could be seen from there. A number of them started bolting towards the Ram Deewar and a scuffle with the volunteers followed. Uma Bharti was immediately called upon to try and assuage the crowd, which was on the verge of a rampage. Even her razor-sharp voice got drowned in the din. Dumbfounded, she stood still, her half-finished lecture having cut no ice with the karsevaks. Seshadri, the second in command of the Sangh Parivar, whispered something into the ears of Singhal, who hastened down from the roof and, escorted by a dozen volunteers, walked out to the karseva site. It was too late by then. Singhal tried to brave the deluge of karsevaks by standing on the platform with arms spread out but that did not deter even one among the advancing mob. On top of that, a stream of invective was hurled at him: “Down with politics and hypocrisy”. The arrogant and undisputed leader stood helpless with a blank stare, with his dhoti almost coming off. I ran with the karsevaks past the PAC and CRPF jawans and stood in a corner, after having entered the structure. At least a couple of hundred karsevaks were already atop the dome. A few thousands more were storming in like an army of ants. All of them were armed with sticks, rods or trishuls. At least a hundred were carrying sledgehammers and shovels. Both the dome and the outer walls were under attack. In about ten minutes, half of the outer wall was reduced to a gaping hole. “Charge tear gas,” shouted DB Ray, the SP of Faizabad, and saw with a surprised look the PAC jawans, carrying tear gas shells, ambling away from the structure with an air of quiet resignation. The CRPF followed suit. One of the CRPF jawans whispered a friendly advice, “Out of this place. Quick, if you value your life”. Within moments, brickbats started raining from atop the dome. A CRPF jawan tried to protect us with his cane shield, but even then, a flying brickbat whistled past me and hit one of my fingers. My notebook flew from my hand. I somehow managed to retrieve it and never brought it out again on that fateful day. Sensing more trouble, I put the press card too in the pocket and took out the “Jai Shri Ram” hairband gifted by Swapan the previous night. I tied it around my neck like a bow tie, but soon realised that it was not going to serve as any talisman for me in this hour of crisis. To my horror, I saw a karsevak with a long bamboo pole chasing me. Thankfully, I knew the place well enough to bolt my way into the Sita Rasoi Bhavan. I was not alone there. The house was full of journalists and photographers, some of whom had lost their cameras or film rolls or video cassettes. Ajay Singh,  ’s photographer from the Lucknow bureau, was sitting with a sling around his right hand. He had for company our beloved Thapa from  , who was also injured. I went up to the roof. Debasis Bhattacharya of   and Avijit Lahiri of  were already there and so was Mohan Sahay of  . All three were unscathed, even though a portly lady of the Durga Vahini was targeting Mohan with brickbats in both her hands. What did Mohan do to be singled out as her target could not be readily ascertained. Fortunately, all of us escaped the wrath of the lady unhurt, including Mohan. A short distance from Sita Rasoi Bhavan, Ram Katha Kunj wore a deserted look, as the meeting was already over. LK Advani was sauntering on the roof with his head down and buried in his chest. Deepak Chopra, his personal secretary, and Pramod Mahajan, were standing with their hands on their heads, clearly displaying a sense of resignation. As Swapan approached Mahajan, he wailed, “This is a disaster. If this madness can’t be stopped right now, we are doomed.” In the meanwhile, all hell had broken loose inside the mosque. Spades, shovels and sledgehammers were raining on the dome. The blackish-green outer layer of the wall gave way to an earthen hue. Clouds of dust were billowing up and amidst the dust we saw many karsevaks, tumbling down the dome to the ground, like mangoes from the tree during a nor’wester. As Singhal returned from the war ground, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar got into a huddle in one corner of the roof, cordoned by carbine-toting securitymen from the National Security Guard (NSG) in their unmistakable sky-blue uniform. They would not let anyone reach anywhere close to the leaders. I heard Singhal giving up. “I have failed. Now you guys go and appeal,” he said. Hearing this, Seshadri, ran up to the stage and snatched the microphone from Acharya Dharmendra and started pleading with the masses. Advani and Mahajan went downstairs to listen to the 1pm news bulletin of “Akashvani”, expecting to hear the news of the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government of Uttar Pradesh. A series of pleas began. “We do not have the Mulayam Singh government but our own government in UP. We must cooperate with them and the police. Those who have entered the structure do come out immediately and take part in a peaceful karseva,” appealed Seshadri. All the other leaders, like Sadhvi Rithambara, Uma Bharti, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, more or less repeated the plea in the same vein which went like this: “You have accomplished what you wanted to do. Now, please listen to us and climb down the dome and ensure that no one, especially women, children and the old get hurt.” Only Vinay Katiyar was more aggressive. “You have to listen to us and the sadhus. You have to climb down,” he thundered. As we anticipated, every plea fell on deaf ears. A large section of the crowd that was listening to the leaders at Ram Katha Kunj now got up and marched towards the mosque. The RSS volunteers, too, who were manning the walls from dawn, gave up their vigil. It was more important for them now to carry the injured karsevaks who fell from the tomb, to the first-aid room near the office. I suddenly found Prabhas Jain, chief photographer of  , writhing in pain in a corner of the roof. He was among the many reporters and photographers who dared to be close to the mosque. We brought this up with the Sangh leaders, but no one was in a mood to even listen. Even as scores of the injured were being brought in for treatment, the leaders again went into a huddle in front of the attic. Mahant Avaidyanath, the formidable MP from Gorakhpur, and a leading light of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, was also there. “All India Radio, in its 1pm bulletin, has said that the karseva is going on peacefully,” announced Pramod Mahajan. The news here was that the troublemakers were from Maharashtra and South India, and therefore could not make head or tail of the appeals made in chaste Hindi by the leaders. A volunteer came gasping and said, “Nothing can be heard there. Please go there and use the microphones,” he said. Promptly began a second phase of appeals. The leaders took their turn. Seshadri spoke in all four South Indian languages while Advani raised his voice to rebuke the karsevaks. Ashok Singhal, having regained his poise, thundered, “Can you hear me? This is Ashok Singhal.” The voices echoed on all the walls, but to no avail. After Singhal spoke, to my surprise, I saw a sadhu ranting his appeal in Bengali, my native tongue. “You mean, even Bengalis are there?” I asked him. “Of course, there are. You had doubts?” the sadhu said with pride. So, I told myself, all this worry about the security of the mosque was a hogwash. These people were eminently proud at what the karsevaks were doing. The leaders were speculating the identities of the karsevaks. “The first man atop the dome was from the prime minister’s constituency, Nandial,” said one. “None of them are our men. They have been packed to Ayodhya from Mumbai by Bal Thackeray,” said another. “Thackeray will take all the credit for today’s incident; just check tomorrow’s newspapers,” remarked Mahajan. The Rajmata clearly lost her patience. Grabbing the microphone, she shouted, “Get these people by their necks and pull them down.” Advani, with a binocular, was trying to figure out what exactly was wrong. As he removed those, I asked, “What did you see?” “Nothing except that hundreds are getting hurt,” he said. Till now, the injured were being carried by hand. Now, there were a few ambulances in place, running to and fro with the injured. All of a sudden, we saw that the two tombs that could be seen from the rooftop of Ram Katha Kunj had nobody atop them. Seshadri, who thought that the continuous appeals for three hours have had effect, suggested Advani that he should now congratulate the karsevaks. As Advani was coming down from the dais after his short vote of thanks, he confronted the horrible reality of the day. A frail sadhu had climbed up to the roof with the small Ramlala idol wrapped in his dusty shawl. He was almost in a fit of convulsion, shuddering frenziedly, his body having scratch marks all over. He removed the drape and showed Advani the idol. “Sir, one dome is being destroyed now. We could somehow save the Ramlala,” he gasped. The seasoned politician that Advani was, immediately realised that not only was the situation out of hand, but he was at his wits’ end as to how to reclaim normalcy. Silent and defeated, he climbed down the stairs. We asked for his reaction. “I have no information on the dismissal of the state government, but it seems a matter of time now. The central forces could be here any moment now,” he signed off. A while earlier, we were speculating the same. If in fact the state government did get dismissed and central forces took charge of the mosque to rein in the unruly mob, they could resort to any measure that they deemed fit. The euphoric karsevaks would not take it lying down and a clear consequence would be many deaths, we shuddered to think. As a matter of fact, we had heard from the grapevine around an hour ago that commandos of the Rapid Action Force of the CRPF wanted to take control of the situation and were on their way, but the district magistrate issued an edict to send them back to their barracks. The BJP government of UP was well in its constitutional rights to refuse the CRPF, and expectedly so, but if and when the government got dismissed, Delhi could give marching orders to the central forces. We all knew that the central government had a contingency plan in case of an eventuality like this. At least home minister SR Chavan kept saying so in Parliament for days in the run-up to this day. As such, twenty-eight battalions of CRPF jawans were already deployed at the Faizabad cantonment, notwithstanding vehement protests by Kalyan Singh. Of these, ten battalions comprised the RPF. We were confident that given the situation, the central government would not look by and bring these forces into action. However, when not a single jawan of the central forces appeared in the distant horizon even as the clock struck three, which coincided with the news of the fall of the dome on our right, the leaders started breathing easy. Tapananda Brahmachari, the Bengali sadhu, lectured me. “You live in ivory towers and live the lives of hedonists. How would you know the schemes of God Almighty? The fall of the mosque was inevitable.” Sadhvi Rithambara was brimming with pride, “Whatever happens, happens for good, whether you want it or not.” The leaders quietly accepted that the inevitable had happened and resigned themselves to their fate. Even as they went down to discuss the subsequent moves, the sadhus took centre stage. “Block all roads that lead to Ayodhya. Go and sit on the highways. Make sure that the central forces are kept at bay,” they thundered on the microphone. “Go to the temple and take your Prasad,” was the continuous instruction that Swami Dharmendra kept blaring. Prasad, in this case was not any food, but broken bricks of the Babri Masjid. A long line of disciples carrying bricks was streaming downstairs, even as the two other domes were being demolished. Chandan Mitra, then the associate editor of the  , suggested that we visit the site before it got completely demolished. Mahajan’s personal secretary assured us that he himself would take us down there and there was nothing to worry. Not that there was no cause for fear. As we made our way through the crowd towards the mosque, the choicest of invective greeted us. Nonetheless, we braved them and approached the mosque. It was a grisly sight. The zeal and fervour with which the karsevaks were taking part in the demolition sent a chill down our spines. Those who had no tools to use were scratching away like mad with their fingernails on the domes. A few young men tied a noose around the domes and were trying to pull them down. Chandan and Ruchira Gupta of  , climbed the hillock while the rest of us stayed down. Wherever we moved, a crowd encircled us. I looked in the front and saw an old man trying to come down the hillock. Wearing thick, dirty lenses, the octogenarian was carrying four bricks on his head. As I gaped at him, I saw two young men cradling Ruchira down to where we stood. She was in shock and could hardly speak. “A few karsevaks mistook Madam for a Muslim woman and pounced on her. It could have been a disaster if we were not around,” said one of the men. We chided Ruchira for her uncalled for bravery and came back to the roof of the office. What was relief half an hour ago when we left for the mosque had by now turned into celebrations. The sadhus were gambling on the exact time when the last of the domes would be razed to the ground. Sadhvi Rithambara removed Swami Dharmendra and took charge. “Ek dhakka aur do” (Give one more push), she roared. “Babri Masjid tod do” (demolish Babri Masjid), replied thousands gathered down below. As the last dome tumbled on to the ground at forty-nine minutes past four, all hell broke loose. Sadhvi jumped down from the stage and hugged Uma Bharti. And then, she kept hugging everyone whom she could find in her proximity. All the sadhus were dancing. The only man maintaining equanimity was BJP President Murli Manohar Joshi. “No questions and no answers. Please excuse me today,” the ashen-faced Joshi mumbled. The December afternoon was fast fading into dusk. I looked outside and saw many houses engulfed in flames. Thick black smoke was billowing from everywhere. None of the police officers had any clue of anything. A few know-all karsevaks explained, “The Muslims are torching their own houses so that they can blame it on us.” And yet, there was no inkling of any central intervention. With a smirk on his face, Ashok Singhal returned to the roof to a fresh round of embraces. Everyone was celebrating, including police officers. One of them enquired, “Have you noted the exact time when the mosque got demolished?” and added in the same breath, “You are fortunate. You just saw history being made.” The leader of RSS’s think tank, Sudarshan, who did not take part in the unbridled celebrations, was sitting quietly on a chair nearby. When asked how he would explain what had happened over the past five hours, he replied in fluent Bengali, “Just one thing. Today’s incident proved that history is not made, it happens.” Whether it was a historic moment or a historic blunder is not something I could have dwelt on then. My only concern then was how to get my copy through to my office in Kolkata. Chandan advised me against depending on the Central Telegraph Office of Faizabad and suggested that I should go back to Lucknow. “For all you know, the telephone and telegraph lines may well be snapped just to prevent news from reaching the outside world,” he said, “just as they did after Operation Blue Star in Golden Temple in 1984.” However, nothing like that happened. It was important to get a reaction from Advani before I left the place. The NSG commando who was manning the door, smeared our foreheads with vermilion. He said triumphantly, it was no ordinary stuff, but extracted out of the forehead of the Ramlala idol, which was now in safe custody. We went inside into complete darkness. Two youths, sitting on a wooden platform in a corner room, were trying desperately to tune in to the news from a transistor set. The electricity connections had been snapped at the time when the domes were being pulled down, they informed. They also informed that Advani was in the next room, trying to get in touch with Delhi via telephone, in candlelight, and was all by himself. Advani emerged after a few minutes. For the past eight years that I had known him closely, I had never seen such a nervous Advani before. It seemed that he could not digest the wild celebrations that were happening right above his head. At least, till then.  Has the UP government been sacked?  No, not yet. However, Kalyan Singh telephoned me twice to seek my permission to offer his resignation. I have advised him against it, because if he does, central forces would immediately take over and we will see bloodbath. But by now, he might have resigned. By the time you reach Lucknow, the resignation would most probably have been accepted too.  When do you plan to return to Delhi?  Till this morning, my plan was to take the evening flight from Lucknow. But now I must stay here for a couple of days more. I cannot leave all these people to their destiny.  Could you get in touch with Delhi?  I have been trying for long, but cannot get through.  How would you react to today’s incident?  Unfortunate and regrettable. A few hours later, after returning to Lucknow, we came to know that Advani changed his mind and left Ayodhya in the evening itself. Many days later, on his release from prison, Advani told journalists that he did not regret the demolition of the Babri Masjid. What he regretted was that he could not gauge the mood of the people. I was not surprised at this volte face. After all, the man was in realpolitik and had his stakes in place. As we came out to the last rays of the setting December sun, speculating on whether Chandan’s new Maruti Gypsy car could escape today’s onslaught, Anju Gupta, the demure yet smart police officer with a walkie-talkie in one hand and a stick in another, met us. She drove out the crowd and whispered into Chandan’s ears, “Two photographers have been in hiding since morning in a nearby room. Mind taking them with you?” We would have been glad to do so, but a small car like his would not have been able to accommodate those two, over and above the eight that we already were, Chandan explained. Anju understood and with a shrug said, “Don’t worry. I shall take care of them.” One of the two photographers was Nitin Rai, our colleague from  . Nitin told us later that had it not been for Anju, he could have been killed that day. When the rest of the police force was enjoying the manhandling of reporters and photographers, the only man around was this little woman. When we reached the main road, we found, to our surprise and relief, that Chandan’s car stood just as he had left it there in the morning. Not a scratch or a dent. The car might have escaped the madness, but not so lucky were the local Muslims. Every Muslim house was torched. A few matador vans, auto rickshaws and car tyres were also burning. The karsevaks did exactly as the leaders asked them to. They blocked the roads by felling logs and turning asphalt drums. Around these blockades the karsevaks were dancing like mad men. As we dodged and swerved to make our way through the flames and the maddening sea of humanity, shouts of “Abhi toh yeh sirf jhaanki hain, Mathura, Kashi baaki hain” (This is just the beginning/we will now turn our attention to Mathura and Banaras) filled the evening sky. Curfew was already imposed in Faizabad. As we reached our hotel, Shaan-E-Awadh, we could see for ourselves how scribes had been beaten up by karsevaks. I met Alok Mitra, my photographer colleague. He looked devastated. “Not only was I beaten to a pulp, but lost everything — two cameras and cash worth nine thousand rupees. They even snatched my gold chain,” he cried. I had no words to console him. In the hotel lobby, there were at least fifty scribes from across the globe, all with sunken faces. We learnt that Peter Hynes Lane, of  , had suffered a serious head injury and was taken to the hospital. He was beaten with an iron rod. Former editor of  , SP Singh, stood next to the reception counter. “In my twenty years as a journalist, I have never seen such manhandling of journalists,” he sounded shell-shocked. But Bob Drolin, the   correspondent, who had come to Ayodhya, for the first time, wrote in  , perhaps what was uppermost in every journalist’s mind that day — “Any journalist who was not scared today was stupid”.

Should this alarm us? Not quite. On the contrary, if the  in 2019, it will be a great moment for our democracy. A government that has little to show in terms of concrete achievements, and one that pulled every trick in the book to damage constitutional values does not deserve a second chance. This is not a prediction, but an argument.   It is time to revisit the basic fallacies in the Modi story. The Modi story was one manufactured as much by the electronic media, as by the \"enthusiastic cadre\" of the party working tirelessly on the ground and on social media. It should have been amply clear to anyone who really cared that what Narendra Modi really offered was essentially a xenophobic vision for India, garnished by tokenistic sound bites on development and Mahatma Gandhi. Positioning the debate in 2014 as one between a state-led model of development through entitlements and private sector-led model of fast growth has been laid bare for everyone to see. First of all, there are sectors where the state’s presence is non-negotiable, such as social safety nets, basic health and elementary education. In these sectors, an unwilling state has dragged its feet on both policy-making and implementation, with disastrous results. Meanwhile, the state has expanded its reach to hitherto unparalleled levels through Aadhaar. Individual liberty has been curbed on several fronts. “Minimum government” is a joke. With  , GSPC and  , no one should harbour any illusions any longer of Narendra Modi being above corruption. This should have never been a surprise, given that in the much-hyped \"Gujarat model\", extractive private-enterprises were promoted at the expense of people and the environment. But this, along with the blatant use of social media to promote false propaganda both on the economy and society, belies any claims that one may make of the BJP being a mascot of \"good governance\". In the five years that this government would have been in power, we would have regressed on all fronts while the fruits of this power have been accumulated by the RSS and its affiliates. In the past four years, the economy has been run to the ground, and if things don’t look as bad as they might have, we have only low oil prices to thank. This should worry even those who couldn’t care less about the current establishment’s insidious social and cultural agenda. No wonder then, the scare-mongering has started. India apparently doesn’t deserve a coalition government. Those that argue this are basically claiming that a country as diverse as ours deserves a homogenous single-narrative government. Bizarrely, supporters of the current government are loathe to even acknowledge the successes of the previous BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The prime minister’s own intemperate remarks recently in Parliament have left no one in doubt that the ruling party is desperate. While economic performance tends to be cyclical, the vicious campaign of hate and the normalisation of violence seen in the past four years have no parallel. That this cannot take place without active sanction of the state is a foregone conclusion. What the government has attempted to do is to cultivate a level of plausible deniability around the actions that it silently patronises. Thus, we see to this day, the government accepts no responsibility for the actions of its ideological affiliates, instead terming them as the \"irresponsible fringe\". This remains a handy polarisation tool, one can make an appearance prior to every election of any significance. It is also important ask now - what have we lost in this era of a dominant one-party rule at the Centre? Did we get a \"strong\" government? The hallmark of this government running with an absolute majority in Parliament has been the deification of a single leader. An authoritarian leader may harbour fantasies of being a saviour of 1.3 billion people - but as we have witnessed so far, this is as unreal as it can get. This is also why the prime minister has been heard falling back on state governments and previous central governments to share the blame for big and painful reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax. No democracy needs an almighty leader, and contrary to hype, this has not yielded sound far-sighted economic policy. On the other hand, it has exposed the pitfalls of empowering a narrow power structure that is unwilling to seek out credible counsel. It has also revealed for all to see, the danger of bringing leaders to power whose hunger for political power and self-aggrandisement is all-consuming, even at the expense of core constitutional institutions. Worst of all, the embodiment of communalism in the top leadership (and the wider RSS-sponsored eco-system) has inspired many an act of violence and terrorism. Is this the absolute majority dividend we ought to be grateful for? Would a coalition government have done better? It is obviously hard to tell, but competing pressures from coalition constituents would have put a lid on the brazenness that we have seen playing out in public life. Also, a \"strong government\" is one that secures a wide consensus and represents all sections of the population. The general elections of 2019 would be the time to demand accountability. India deserves better, and we should not let ourselves be distracted by alarmists who are raising the bogey of unsettled coalition politics.","title":"Why everybody feels India is heading back to a coalition government in 2019","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-elections-2019-coalition-modi-bjp-rss-minimum-government-joke/story/1/22381.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15271},{"author":"Madhuri Danthala","content":"February 15, the birth anniversary of Susan B Anthony, a 19  century women’s rights activist who championed the women’s suffrage movement, is an apt occasion to ruminate over the Women’s Reservation bill. The bill, also known as the Constitution (108th Amendment) Bill, 2008, seeks to ensure that 33 per cent of the seats in the Lok Sabha as well as in state legislative Assemblies are reserved for women. Introduced by the UPA government in 2008, it was passed in the Rajya Sabha, but the Lok Sabha hadn’t voted on it and it therefore lapsed after the Congress-led UPA government lost power in 2014. Had it been enacted, seats would have been reserved on a rotation basis with no seat being reserved more than once in three consecutive general elections. Sadly, there has been no attempt to empower women politically since the bill lapsed. India already has the ignominy of being ranked 148  in terms of representation of women in executive government. We have a mere 11.8 per cent women in the Lok Sabha as against a global average of about 22.8 per cent women in national legislatures (as of June 2016). These figures only indicate the dismal state of women’s empowerment, especially in roles that involve decision-making. Numerous studies have indicated that women’s leadership style tends to be more inclusive and risk averse. This augurs well for any society to attain inclusive and sustainable development. For instance, many scholars are of the view that had there been more women in the top echelons of the corporate field, the global financial crisis of 2008 may have been averted. Giving credence to this view is a report by the UNDP titled, \"Corruption, Accountability and Gender: Understanding the Connections\", implies that having more women representatives could lead to lesser corruption. To understand the correlation between gender parity in politics and development, one must look at the Nordic countries. All the Nordic countries are in the top 10 list of women representatives in Parliament, with Sweden accounting for about 44.7 per cent women in their legislature. This is reflected in their national policies known for being inclusive and gender sensitive. Some of their policies and schemes include, mandatory paternity leave, alongside maternity leave, and post-maternity re-entry programmes. Meanwhile, since 2008, in Norway, it is statutorily mandated that all  . Even in India, there is strong evidence to indicate that where women are involved, there is better development. The United Nations Women, in its website cites research which has revealed that women-led panchayats, had 62 per cent higher drinking water projects than in those led by men. The website also states that a causal relationship was observed in the number of women representatives in local bodies in Norway and better child welfare. It is the prospect of having such provisions in India that should dominate our public discourse and electoral debates. Sadly, our discourse is rife with mudslinging, cheap personal jibes, slander and the like. Rather than debating about the places of worship leaders visit, or the promises of subsidies for pilgrimages, we must be debating about ways to ensure inclusive and sustainable development. Given such a bleak scenario, it is encouraging that at a recent interaction with people, Rahul Gandhi had reiterated what he has been saying for long - that the Congress party under his leadership will ensure more women are brought into the political system. During the interaction, he cited a recent meeting he held with party leaders from a state where a panel of 15 members that discussed women’s empowerment, ironically, had only one woman representative. Instead of indulging in the usual meaningless political jibes, it would be in the best interests of the nation if all parties mulled over this, as the situation is unlikely to be much different from what Rahul Gandhi illustrated. Since all parties agree that women’s empowerment is a matter of paramount importance, they should come together and ensure there is gender parity in their parties. Further, it would be in the best interest of India’s development that all parties put aside their differences and pass the women’s reservation bill. Surely, it cannot be such a difficult thing to do when every party agrees that we need more women in the (legislative) Houses.","title":"Why the women’s reservation bill is important now more than ever","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/womens-reservation-bill-parliament-33-percent-reservation/story/1/22375.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15272},{"author":"Dev Ankur Wadhawan","content":"About 10 months ago, in April 2017, there was a spring in the step of Rajasthan chief minister  .   had turned into a prestige issue and Vasundhara took it upon herself to win the seat and how. She camped and campaigned at the Dholpur Palace for several days, travelling across the constituency, overseeing the campaigning, for which almost all her retinues were pressed into service. The party managed to secure the seat as   beat the Congress by a record margin of over 38,000 votes. The government tom-tommed the victory and claimed it was a reflection of people's confidence in her leadership and BJP's model of governance in the run-up to the Assembly elections in 2018. Cut to February 2018. The result of the three by-elections, including that for Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha constituencies, is out. Vasundhara Raje dispensation would not have expected a worse result. It has been left cutting a sorry figure as in the final year of the government's tenure the voters in these constituencies have overwhelmingly expressed their lack of confidence in her leadership and what her dispensation has managed to achieve or rather not achieve in her four years at the helm. The \"Rani\", facing flak for her domineering style of functioning, has her political career on the line like never before. Speculation about her and some of her trusted lieutenants in the government making way has been rife since the results came. Inaccessibility, disconnect from the masses, unwillingness or inability to address the pressing issues of unemployment, lack of development, price rise, being petty-minded are some of the charges flying thick and fast against her. Murmurs of discontent against her from within the party are no longer just murmurs. They have grown louder and are likely to become shriller as Assembly elections draw nearer this year. Party leaders have been worrying about their fate if the current leadership carries on in the run-up to the polls this year. On a day the chief minister presented the final state Budget of her current term in office, a controversial audio conversation purportedly of a party MLA from Alwar was leaked. A voice believed to be that of the MLA is heard saying he has informed the party that results will be disastrous if the current leadership is not changed. Whether it was the Narendra Modi wave, the anti-incumbency against Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan and the Manmohan Singh dispensation at the Centre or general disenchantment against the Congress during 2013 Assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP's honeymoon period in Rajasthan is well and truly over. This has already set warning bells within the BJP, both at the state and central level. Here are some humbling facts the BJP's top brass has been chewing upon during the last few days after the defeat in the  : The BJP's candidate from Ajmer constituency lost to Congress' candidate by over 84,000 votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by a margin of more than 1.70 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha polls as Sachin Pilot suffered a humiliating defeat. In Alwar, the ruling party's candidate lost by a massive margin of over 1.96 lakh votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by close to 2.84 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In Mandalgarh Assembly by-poll, the Congress candidate defeated the BJP's candidate by over 12,000 votes. This despite the fact that the Congress was in a tight spot in the constituency as a party leader decided to contest as Independent, thereby cutting into the party's votes. On February 12, as \"Rani\" stood inside the Vidhan Sabha, looking at her Budget speech, one which made one promise after another, ranging from farm loan waiver to loan for 50,000 families under Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Antyoday Swarojgar Yojna, much of the old vanity surrounding her seemed to be a thing of the past. Electoral defeats can truly be the most humbling experience for a politician but whether it came too late for Vasundhara Raje or will she still be able to course correct is something only time can tell.","title":"Future looks grim for Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajasthan-by-polls-vasundhare-raje-rajasthan-politics-assembly-elections-sachin-pilot/story/1/22331.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15273},{"author":"Dinesh C Sharma","content":"In the past few weeks, many new policies related to the health sector have been announced, the foremost being the National Health Protection Scheme unveiled in the Budget. Though details of this scheme have not yet been revealed, it will be a government-funded insurance plan to cover hospitalisation costs at secondary and tertiary care levels for poor families. The National Medical Council (NMC) Bill, aimed at bringing in a new medical regulatory authority, is also being reviewed by Parliament. Doctors have taken to the street against this move. Another health-related initiative is the draft of the new pharmaceutical policy. Amidst all this, the Niti Aayog has issued a Health Index that ranks the performance of states in the health sector based on indicators like total fertility rate, maternal mortality rate, status of health personnel, etc, but overlooks crucial indicators like public investment in health. It appears the government and the institutions concerned are treating all these steps in isolation. This amounts to a piecemeal approach to health. We need a comprehensive blueprint for the overhaul of the health sector. Take, for instance, the health protection scheme. In the absence of a policy format and clear objectives, any such \"insurance only\" scheme may not yield desired results and prove to be counter-productive like similar schemes implemented earlier by Union and state governments. Most such schemes have led to a rise in unnecessary procedures and malpractices, and not contributed to better health outcomes. High incidence of costly procedures like stenting, heart surgeries and hysterectomies have been reported in states that funded health insurance. Shifting the government’s responsibility to the private sector without necessary quality and pricing checks would be dangerous. The Clinical Establishment Act — which most states have not implemented — and the NMC Bill, which is pending in the Parliament, are supposed to address these issues. Another interrelated issue is the drug policy. India is fast losing its advantage of cheap drugs, as the domestic drug industry is becoming dependent on China for the supply of bulk drugs for manufacturing even essential medicines because we have systematically neglected public bulk drug firms. At a time when the world is making a gradual shift to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), we are moving towards a private sector cum-insurance-led health system. UHC means providing a minimum set of services for all citizens. For this, countries need to strengthen their health systems and involve private sector wherever necessary. The UHC approach in India is visible in the provision of free ART (Antiretroviral therapy) to people with HIV, free medication to TB patients and the neighbourhood clinic scheme in Delhi. All these are government-led schemes but involve private providers. If UHC is the goal, then it can’t be achieved via insurance alone. We need to strengthen primary care for all. There is no substitute for greater public investment in the health sector.

Most likely not. But apparently, as per the doctor minister, the same may not be true for forest cover, especially the type of forest and forest cover density — important parametres for assessing the health of our forests, the country’s veritable lungs that keep us alive. On Monday, February 12, 2018, the doctor and his team that released the India State of Forest Report 2017, patted their backs for an apparent increase in the forest and tree cover only and largely chose to ignore the weak points as large parts of India lost very dense forests, as was evident from comparison with the previous assessment.   ** The total forest cover as per current assessment is 7,08,273 sqkm, which is 21.54 per cent of the geographic area of the country. ** The tree cover is estimated to be 93,815 sqkm (9.38 million ha), which is 2.85 per cent of the geographical area. ** The total forest and tree cover is 8,02,088 sqkm (80.20 million ha), which is 24.39 per cent of the geographical area. ** There has been an increase of 6,778 sqkm of forest cover at the national level. (After considering the changes during two assessments – 2015 (updated) and 2017). ** Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala have contributed by an increase of 2,141 sqkms, 1,101 sqkm and 1,043 sqkm, respectively. ** There is an increase of 1,243 sqkm in tree cover compared to the 2015 assessment. But a closer look at the  tells us that not all forests are healthy. It sounds more like number jugglery. Even when very dense forest (VDF), that is all land with tree canopy density of 70 per cent and above, increased by 9,525 sqkm from 2015 to 2017, the moderately dense forest (MDF), that is all lands with tree canopy density of 40 per cent and more but less than 70 per cent, decreased by 4,421sqkm. States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have shown decrease in the VDF category. In the MDF category, it is the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Uttarakhand, West Bengal that have shown a negative change. A footnote for Jammu and Kashmir in all cases and for Odisha at another place just add to the gloomy picture. For Jammu and Kashmir, the note reads “includes Jammu and Kashmir area outside LoC that is under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China”. For Odisha, in the table showing “Recorded Forest Areas (RFAs) in States and UTs”, a footnote mentions: “RF (reserved forest) in Odisha includes 9,175 sqkms of proposed RF, PF (protected forest) includes 15,117 sqkms revenue forest/deemed forest and 191 sqkms of private forest.” Bah! So much for quality of forests! As rightly pointed out by this June 2016  titled “Why Defining a 'Forest' in India Is Harder Than It Sounds (And Why That Matters)”, the “Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has been involved in a tussle with the Tribal Affairs Ministry over the question of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) as well as the rights of forest-based communities. The Environment Ministry has been an instrumental part of this battle by reinterpreting the FRA and paving the road to doing away with consent, on multiple levels, from ‘gram sabhas’ (village-level governments) before chopping down India’s traditional forests”. The debate is not settled yet. What is more is minister Harsh Vardhan said, “We are 10th in the list of top forest cover countries. When the world over, there has been a decreasing trend in forest cover, India has witnessed an increase. The other nine countries have a population density of about 150 persons compared to India’s 350 (population density). This is important.” But as is very clear from a   by D Venkateswarlu, an IFS officer from Jharkhand, as part of his assignment for his course at TERI University, each country has its own definitions of what constitutes forests. The European Commission has defined forestland as having at least 20 per cent canopy closure (10 per cent in the Mediterranean forests) and a minimum area of 0.5 ha (1 ha = 0.01Sq. KM); Brazil defines forest as an area of land greater than one hectare, with more than 30 per cent canopy cover and a minimum tree height of five metres; USA’s Forest Service says forest land includes land at least 10 per cent of which is stocked by trees of any size, or land formerly having had such tree cover that will be naturally or artificially regenerated; Canada says forest land is constituted by areas of land where tree canopies cover more than 10 per cent of the total area and the trees, when mature, can grow to a height of more than five metres. China, on the other hand, says forest is “a land having a minimum area 0.67 ha, minimum crown cover of 20 per cent and a minimum tree height of two metres”. Clearly, even when India finds a place amid the first 10 countries, by definition, our forests do not compare qualitatively with other forests. But this fact about what is it that they call a forest does not find mention in the current report. Most worrisome is the situation in high altitudes and northeastern areas: ** The total forest cover in the northeastern region is 171306 sqkm, which is 65.34 per cent of its geographical area in comparison to the national forest cover of 21.54 per cent. ** The current assessment shows a decrease of forest cover to the extent of 630 sqkms in the NE region. ** All altitude zones above 1,000 metres (approximately 3,800 feet) have registered a small decrease in forest cover as against those below 1,000 metres, which show an increase. As many as six states of the northeastern region showed a negative change as compared to 2015 assessment. Arunachal Pradesh (-190), Meghalaya (-116), Mizoram (-531), Nagaland (-450), Sikkim (-9) and Tripura (-164) showed negative change while only Assam and Manipur showed positive changes. When it came to the alarmingly decreasing numbers from the northeastern states, Dr Harsh Vardhan said: “The NE already has 70 per cent of forest cover. We will go into the nitty-gritty and look into the reasons and all positive, corrective measures would be taken.”He also said, “We will treat it as a blessing in disguise and deal with it accordingly.” But then, neither did the minster nor the Forest Survey of India (FSI)  have a clear idea as to what could be the exact reason. Saibal Dasgupta, DG, FSI, said, “Jhoom cultivation can be one of the reasons for the decrease in forest cover in the NE. We will try to increase the livelihood options (for the people of the NE).” When asked if the increasing rate of development projects in the northeast that need cutting down or drowning of forest – such as highways, hydropower projects or industries, could be a reason – the officer, however, said the department did not have segregated data on diverted forest land and land under jhoom cultivation. The picture is especially scary as most of the forests in the hill states of northeast belong to indigenous communities, leading to the obvious question: who is usurping them? Now, to understand what “a small decrease in forest cover” means: (Forest cover in Altitude zones (Area in sqkm)) Clearly, what the report and even the minister termed as “small decrease” for areas above 1,000 metres (3,800 feet and above) is not as small as they want you to believe. The areas above 4,000 feet are the Himalayan ranges that give birth to the majority of our rivers. Forests are vital for the survival of these rivers and the negative decrease (- 217, -193, -76 and -99) for all ranges above 1,000 metres should set the alarm bells ringing in the Himalayan states. They are already bearing the brunt of climate change witnessing decreased snowfall in winters, increased temperatures and drier atmosphere every passing year. Water bodies inside forests and bamboo find a separate mention in the India State of Forests Report 2017 for the first time. Acknowledging that “forests play a vital role in water conservation and improve the water regime in the area”, different state forest departments besides plantation and protection also undertake steps to improve water conservation through different interventions such as building check dams, vegetation barriers, percolation ponds, contour trenches etc under various central and state government schemes. As per the latest assessment based on comparison of satellite images from 2005 and 2015, water bodies inside forest cover have increased by 2,647 sqkm during the last decade. Maharashtra (432 sqkm), Gujarat (428 sqkm) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sqkm) are the top three states that have seen a spike in water bodies within forest areas. Nearly all the states have shown progress in terms of the growth of water bodies, the report said. After recently changing the definition of bamboo as “grass”, compared to the earlier definition of “tree”, the government plans to emphasise more on bamboo’s ecological and economic value. For the first time, bamboo finds mention as a separate chapter of India State of Forest Report 2017 even though it was always an integral part of National Forest Inventory. Instead of regular comparison with 2015 data, as done in other cases, for bamboo, the report compares earlier estimates of 2011. As per those estimates, the total bamboo bearing area in the country has increased by 1.73 million ha. At the national level, the total number of culms has been estimated to be 28,103 million. As compared to the estimate of ISFR 2011, there is an increase about 19 million tonnes equivalent green weight of bamboo observed in the present assessment.","title":"How the quality of India's forests — especially in hills — is suffering","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-forest-report-climate-change-ecology-ministry-of-forests-and-environment/story/1/22336.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15275},{"author":"Arindam De","content":"So Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks that north Indians are \"scum of the earth\"?

The people coming from those states actually want to recreate Haryana in Goa. “Today we have almost six times population of Goa coming as tourists... Those tourists are not top-end tourists, they are also the scum of the earth.\"  According to Sardesai, the heavy influx of north Indian tourists was making it difficult for the state to address the issue of garbage. Well, the only thing infuriated north Indians and Goa aficionados can say is that the   shows the minister needs to clear the cobwebs from his head. Ruling coalitions across the country, in their bid to cling on to power, often enlist individuals or organisations that show scant respect for the country and its citizens. Nor do they respect the ideals that define the leading party. Such elements are neither friends nor allies, but opportunists. (Sardesai's Goa Forward Party is a coalition partner in the BJP-led government.)    It's true that on an average, a foreign tourist does spend almost two-and-a-half times the amount spent by an ordinary domestic tourist. But ministers blaming fellow countrymen or even foreign migrants for ruining their state is not just unfair but uncalled for. In June 2016, the then deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza had said that migrants are responsible for the  . Of course, he was echoing the feelings of the then CM Laxmikant Parsekar who blamed Nigerians for their lifestyle and attitude. Their statements had seen the opposition calling out the BJP-led government's bias towards Africans. It is not a secret that the foreign drug lords have been operating with impunity in Goa. Once limited to the north, the drug menace has spread to south Goa too, and intel reports suggest that the drug net is only expanding in the area. Of course, this is not to say that all   are responsible for it, but the fact that   himself has spoken on the issue deserves some attention. But can people like Sardesai blame north Indians for \"all the problems that Goa is facing today\"? What about his \"foreign and high-end tourists\"? As for the minister's other statement that north Indians are gobbling up everything - land and properties - I have this to say. Well, they indeed are because everything is up for grabs. Goa is a beautiful place and whatever is on sale - land and property - will be bought. Domestic tourists are not   land from Goans. No one from Haryana is pushing Goans out of their properties. On the contrary, people are buying properties in Goa at prices usually higher than what the locals would pay.  That an NDA ally deems it right to say that \" \" coming to Goa are ruining the paradise that Goa is, it is not just an insult to the poor but north Indian members of Sardesai's coalition partner, BJP, too.","title":"Why Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks poor domestic tourists are ‘scum of the earth’","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/goa-minister-vijai-sardesai-domestic-north-indian-tourists-scum-of-earth-parrikar-drugs/story/1/22295.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15276},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"There was a reason why  , without making any direct reference to actor-turned-Congress leader Divya Spandana's tweet on the prime minister, made his point clear by saying that character assassination of any individual was not right. At a public meeting in Bangalore last week, Narendra Modi had said farmers were his \"top priority\" and went on to expand \"TOP\" as tomato, onion, potato. In response,  , alias Ramya, took a dig at Modi, wondering if he was on \"POT\", which was seen as a reference to cannabis. (She is the head of Congress social media cell.)  A subsequent clarification that she meant \"POT\" - potato, onion, tomato - understandably did not find many takers, and the BJP went on the offensive claiming the tweet was derogatory to the PM. Siddaramaiah said, \"I have countered Modi's allegations point-by-point against our government, but refrained from making any personal attack. He may be our political rival, but I will not speak disrespectfully of the PM personally.\"  Ahead of the elections in Karnataka, this is one of the main worries for the Congress. It wants to avoid any Congress leader doing a Mani Shankar Aiyar and give Modi the opening he is looking for. In Aiyar, Modi has had a dependable electoral \"ally\". During the Gujarat election campaigning, Modi exploited the dinner Aiyar had hosted for his Pakistani guests and suggested that the Indian guests, which included former prime minister Manmohan Singh, were hatching a conspiracy. When Aiyar called Modi a \"neech aadmi\" to accuse him of playing dirty politics, Modi said it was a casteist slur and alleged Aiyar had gone to Pakistan to offer \"supari\" for him. In 2014, Aiyar had inadvertently helped the BJP to go on the offensive when he smugly offered space for Modi to set up a tea stall. Modi went to town, interpreting it as an insult to his past vocation, and the arrogance of the party [Congress] in power. Ever since he took charge of the party, Rahul Gandhi has maintained that he and his party will follow a certain propriety even when mud is thrown at rivals in the heat and dust of elections. There is no booklet available that lists out the dos and don'ts, but it seems in the Congress book, everyone but Modi is fair game. So the name of Arun Jaitley can be changed by Gandhi to  . The BJP has returned the compliment by branding the Siddaramaiah government a 10 per cent government, insinuating that it is corrupt. This reluctance to attack the PM at a personal level is more to do with fear factor than real respect. Political strategists point out the example of Arvind Kejriwal who at one point in time, would not tire of dragging Modi into just about every issue concerning Delhi. So much so that it started to look like the Delhi CM suffered from a Modi-phobia. And the more he attacked the PM, his own stature started diminishing with even those who had voted him to power in Delhi, asking why he does not let his work do the talking instead of venting his spleen through Twitter everyday. Which is why it will be interesting to note how the Siddaramaiah versus Modi battle plays out on Twitter. For the past one week, the Karnataka CM has taken on the PM, countering his allegations with facts. This has BS Yeddyurappa, the BJP's chief ministerial face, feeling left out as he expected Karnataka to be a Yeddyurappa versus Siddaramaiah fight. On numerous occasions, he has tried to draw the CM into an argument by responding to his tweets. Siddaramaiah's effort to target Modi directly runs the risk of going wrong for two reasons. One, people like to see a battle between equals, and it would seem that Siddaramaiah is punching above his weight by taking on the PM. Two, it will take just one slip by Siddaramaiah for his rivals, including Modi, to use that to counter attack him. Similarly, the approach of actor Prakash Raj is fraught with risk. For the past many months, Raj has been speaking out against both Modi and Amit Shah, accusing them of being anti-Hindu. If Raj campaigns against right-wing hardline elements in Karnataka, as he may do, it will obviously be seen as helping the Congress. It is a double-edged sword as any kind of vitriol that is seen as a personal attack, could boomerang. It is here that the Nitish Kumar strategy is spoken of as a better template. He made the Bihar 2015 election as a \"Bihari versus Bahari\" duel, positioning himself and Lalu Yadav as sons of the soil versus the two outsiders in Modi and Amit Shah. So Siddaramaiah's emphasis on Kannadiga pride as a counterpoint to the nationalistic approach of BJP, would be a better electoral ploy. Karnataka has always been seen by the BJP as its gateway to south India. The party made a mess of the chance it got in 2008, with Yeddyurappa who was the CM, getting embroiled in corruption cases. It would now want to make amends. With Karnataka being the largest state under Congress control, the stakes are high for both the parties. Enough reason for politicians to stoop as low.  ","title":"In Karnataka, no one dares to upset Modi, not even Congress","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-congress-rahul-gandhi-karnataka-siddaramaiah-arun-jaitley-divya-spandana/story/1/22296.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15277},{"author":"Omair Ahmad","content":"The recent Gujarat state elections were marked by the BJP and its supporters campaigning against Muslims, and the Congress  . The one candidate who did speak on this issue was  , an independent candidate supported by the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, fighting for a seat reserved for Dalits. Weeks ago in  , Uttar Pradesh, as rioters disrupted a Republic Day hoisting of flags by Muslims and called them “Pakistanis”, the one legislator to raise the issue as one of fundamental rights was  , representing a regional party with one MP in the Lok Sabha. His ability to influence national politics is next to non-existent. The marginalisation of Muslims in national politics is almost complete. Their position is that of the eternal stuffed toy, to be vilified at will, with almost no legislator willing to speak of the fundamental right to life of more than 170 million people in the world’s largest democracy. The virtual political disenfranchisement of Muslims in India is a corrosive problem, with potentially catastrophic impact on Indian democracy, but there are no Muslim political leaders of note to address this. At such points, there is the usual lament about the fact that Muslims have not been able to produce a leader of the calibre of Abdul Kalam Azad, India’s first education minister, and who was elected to the post of President of the Indian National Congress, on par with Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. What these lamentations ignore is that Azad was a politician of pre-Partition India. The loss of the large Muslim population in Punjab and East Pakistan/Bangladesh meant that the national base of Muslim politics was vastly reduced after Independence. The Muslims who would have voted for the Congress and a Congress Muslim – bear in mind that in the 1937 elections, the Congress won 25 of the 59 seats reserved for Muslims, including all 15 from the then-North West Frontier Province – were gone (the Unionist Party in undivided Punjab won 101 seats, almost on par with the Muslim League total of 106, and its base was largely the part now in Pakistan). They had to, and still do, navigate politics in different states. With the loss of large mass bases, Partition meant that there was literally no state in the Indian Union where Muslims accounted for a majority, apart from Jammu & Kashmir. Given that J&K accounts for one per cent of the Indian population, and the role of Chief Minister of J&K has basically been reduced to asking, “How high?” when the Centre says, “Jump”, its impact on national politics is hardly worth considering. In the rest of India, the chance of a Muslim party dominating a state, or even playing a major part in its politics, was doomed from the start. In the first-past-the-post elections that we have (we can see from Germany or South Africa that proportional representation better manages diverse polities), a candidate usually needs between 30 to 35 percent of the vote-share to win. There are almost no constituencies in India where Muslims have that much of the population, even if they were not factionalised among themselves to begin with. Lastly is the issue of finance. After Partition, not only did Muslims no longer have a mass base, they lost many of their most prosperous community members, with only a very few of the elite remaining. These were deeply disconnected from the conditions and concerns of, and often in exploitative relationships with, their poorer brethren. Today, if Muslims are found on the national landscape, their wealth is largely tied to the arts – and the  like Aamir Khan or Shah Rukh Khan when they question anti-Muslim rhetoric or actions highlight exactly how precarious their position is, despite their fame or success. Given these conditions, post-Independence Muslim politics has been dominated by two types of Muslims, the “sarkari mussalman”, who kowtowed to the ruling dispensation in return for a share of the spoils, or the “unlettered mullah”, who spoke of Muslim concerns as religious difference, as distinct from the national agenda. In both these cases, what these politicians offered to the ruling parties is a vote base that they could energise, whether by patronage or polarisation. Neither offered an investment in the principles of the Constitution, in fundamental rights, in the life of the nation, in issues of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, in deepening democracy, and the importance of federalism and the identity of regions. Why would they? They were in the business of being doorkeepers, and if doors were easily accessible to all, their own value would plummet. This corrosive failure is most clearly seen in Kashmir, where Muslims have largely adopted a “nationalistic” line that is deeply at odds with Constitutional values. The cost of this has been that a political issue has been handled as a communal issue. Today, as many of the same features of misgovernance in Kashmir find their way into the national agenda, Kashmiris snarkily comment to Muslims – who ignored these very same issues of the degradation of democracy, the gutting of institutions, of impunity and murder – that they have got what they deserved. And frankly, it is true. Too busy fighting little turf wars to protect their “privilege” to serve the rulers, or in highlighting their difference from mainstream debates, Muslims have found themselves completely on the sidelines of democratic debate. In many ways, the failure of the elite is far greater than that of the mullahs. Most of the community members who attend madarsas, or are trained as ulema, come from under-privileged families who have few options, and have not had the depth and breadth of education or experience to engage well with politics. The elite do not have this excuse. If there is hope for Muslim leadership, it lies in the fact that the prosperity of the nation as a whole has allowed a wider educated middle class to emerge. While the Sachar Commission report highlighted the woeful socio-economic condition of Muslims, what should not be forgotten is that Indians as a whole are far better educated and living in better conditions than at the time of Independence. As part of that progress, Muslims have benefited too, if not as much as others. This rising base of capable young men and women are the ones in the frontlines of the battle for Constitutional values, it is on their shoulders that the future of Muslim politics in India rests, and the future of India as a whole, because there is no good future with such a large part of the body politic going unrepresented.","title":"The failure, and hope, of Muslim politics in India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/muslims-in-india-communal-politics-bjp-hindutva-kasganj-asaduddin-owaisi/story/1/22300.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15278},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"Our history and mythology are full of women punished for laughing. Laughing in an open court at the king’s follies, when everyone would rather please the emperor, is blasphemy, a written and/or unwritten code. Laughing at untruths peddled as fierce rhetoric, combatting willful instrumentalisation of historical ignorance to farcical and fearful ends is a heroine’s job. Standing out is a heroine’s way of being, laughing at the powerful whom no one dare displease is what she does for a living. , Congress MP, 63, laughed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday (February 7), when he was delivering a speech in Rajya Sabha. He was going on and on about how Gandhi wanted a “Congress-mukt Bharat”, just like hours back in Lok Sabha he had claimed without Sardar Patel, Kashmir wouldn’t have been divided. These historical distortions, fraudulent claims, these lies, that PM Modi utters in Parliament, the highest legislating body in the country, in the garb of “roaring”, or “declaring war on the Nehru-Gandhis”, as much of the media would have us believe, are enough to drive anyone with a secondary school sense of history into peals of hysterical laughter. On Twitter, historian Srinath Raghavan tweeted out the obvious “facts” of 1947 and the case of Kashmir, and many shared his words with a hearty laugh at the PM. Chowdhury laughed inside Parliament, in Rajya Sabha. While she was laughing, she was breaching “etiquette”, written down rules of good conduct, usually reserved to maintain order in the House, but also to preserve equality among the representatives. Yet, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu interrupted PM Modi to chastise Chowdhury, saying he needed to report such “loose talk and unruly behaviour”. Naidu didn’t interrupt Modi once, or contradict his claims of counterfeit, his downright disgusting humiliation of the most luminous star in India’s historical firmament, Jawaharlal Nehru. Naidu interrupted to reprimand Chowdhury instead, give her sermons of discipline, egging on PM Modi in his act of hysterical fraudulence.  It was then PM Modi, in a matter of pointed rebuke, said the chairman mustn’t say anything to Chowdhury, because it was after a long time since Ramanad Sagar's   serial was aired, did they get to hear such a laughter. MoS home Kiren Rijiju tweeted out the clip, describing Chowdhury’s laugh as “vexatious”. Some headlines called it  , others reported how BJP national president and Rajya Sabha MP Amit Shah burst out laughing after Modi’s rebuke, along with the men and a few women in the upper House, laughing along, because they dare not laugh at. \r\n \r\n There are many Ramayanas, but in the version most pleasing to the north Indian patriarchy that has a fetish for the warrior king Rama, the laughing women are not the female protagonists. Surpanakha, Ravana’s sister, supposedly laughed at Lakshmana, and had her nose cut off. Manthara, the hunchback aide to Kaikeyi, the middle queen, the muddle queen, of Dasharatha, perhaps laughed while whispering the lure of power and the throne into the queen’s ears. Laughing in Ramayana is akin to evil; laughing is dangerous because it liberates women from the rib cage of patriarchy. In turn, patriarchy, its scribes, retellers, turn them into deformed minds and bodies, monstrosities stinking of deeply racial stereotypes, making them responsible for what’s ultimately a challenge to the inevitability of primogeniture - eldest male succession - and male control of everything around. In feminist rereadings of Ramayana,  , as she sings the blues, controls her womb, makes decisions. In male fantasy version of Ramayana, Sita immolates herself for the sake of her husband, to prove her chastity. However, in the superior epic that’s Mahabharata, the female protagonist Draupadi laughs a lot, menstruates, has sex with five men at least. Draupadi laughs at Duryodhana when he falls into a pool thinking it’s a crystal floor in a palace at Indraprastha. Duryodhana takes his revenge by having his younger brother try disrobe Draupadi in the court of king Dhritarashtra, before a manel of royal loyalists, some tied to the throne, some to sycophancy, turning away their gaze from the injustice. The Kuru clan gets decimated in a “just war”, desired by the Kurus themselves. Laughing women appear in Greco-Roman myths. Helen (before she was of Troy) had laughed at the uncouth Menelaus, whom she was wedded to. She eloped with Paris, and Homer made her the peg on which to hang the male imperial and sexual insecurities. In  , French feminist Helene Cixous wrote how the laughing woman is always the outlier, the biggest challenger to patriarchy’s self-replicating tropes. So, she must be turned into a demon, a gorgon. The laughing woman is seen as a castrator, an antithesis to the power of the male pen and the penis. Laughing women are punished by gods everywhere, turned into stone, raped, turned into animals, cast away, chained, imprisoned, rebuked, called a witch, bitch. Laughing women’s agency makes the gods shiver, so they take to collective punishment. Even Milan Kundera, the great Czech writer of  - weaponised the male laughter at the powerful as worthy of his writerly attention, critical engagement. Female laughter deflated even men like Kundera; so characters like Zedna laugh but also complain, nag. Female solitude was erotic - but female laughter too challenging, too uncomfortable, in fact “emasculating”. Men laughing at men, or men becoming victims of the political consequences of their unscheduled laughter, men refusing to join in the chorus of orchestrated laughter, the theatre of cheerfulness at a totalitarian time - they happen to people Kundera’s universe of laughing men in a laughable world. But women are either props of that laughable world, or outliers incinerating the self-worth of these leading men, prompting the writer to scavenge the myths in search of a bogus salvation. Renuka Chowdhury laughed at Narendra Modi, in Parliament. It’s the laughter of powerless at the powerful, the laughter that momentarily inverts the order, as it were. Chowdhury’s laughter resembled that of Baubo, the Greek goddess of mirth and laughter, whose liberation is bundled with her wisdom, for she knows she must laugh at the powerful, and heal the powerless. And that solitary laughter at power is incredibly more powerful than a court laughing at its single female challenger, the harbinger of the imminent fall.      ","title":"Why Renuka Chowdhury’s laughter is more powerful than that of Modi coterie","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/renuka-chowdhury-laughter-modi-parliament-patriarchy-bjp-ramayana-mahabharata-draupadi/story/1/22262.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15279},{"author":"Geeta Mohan","content":"The  administration, in what is being termed as \"bold\" and a \"historic\" visit, has decided to de-hyphenate   and engage with both nations separately. While many believed that the Indian prime minister and his government will shift course, after the BJP came to power in 2014, from the traditional line that India always took on Palestine, the decision to vote in favour of Palestine at the UN and now the visit has infused hope and confidence in Ramallah. Not only has a strong foreign policy decision been made, but also the highest level of the Indian leadership has “belled the cat”, taking on the daunting task of visiting Ramallah. \r\n \r\n For many years, India’s visit to Israel and Palestine at the highest level were given a miss keeping in mind the \"sensitivities\" involved. And then in 2017, breaking away from past trappings, Prime Minister Modi took the bold decision to visit Israel - visit Israel alone without touching Palestine, which made many question India’s stand. Have we given up on Palestine? Is this a shift in India’s foreign policy? These were the common refrain. Clearly not. Certain sections in India hailed the Israel visit as one where India has charted out a new course for itself without pandering to the “appeasement” brigade and reaching out to Muslims... Until reality set in. India understood the importance of balancing ties and accounting for the important role Arab nations play in India’s economic growth story which led to the announcement of his “stand-alone” visit to Palestine. But many still ask, will Modi stay the course on India’s support to the Palestinian cause? India’s defence and security ties with Israel is growing exponentially. And the strong Jewish lobby certainly can help India’s case against Pakistan in the United States. But then again, Israel also has great relations with China. A nation that sides with Pakistan even if all odds are against the latter. Either Israel can be an influencer or despite strong Sino-Israel ties, China can continue to support Pakistan. The Arab world, on the other hand, is a stabilising factor providing jobs and is a major source of energy for India. But here again, terrorism and security matters sometimes adversely impact India’s interests. If India is trying to be transactional in its dealings with the nations of this region, then the decision to stay the course works in India’s favour. There is a strong opinion growing in Palestine that with the disruptive role that the US has played on the issue of Jerusalem and with the closeness that Modi shares with Benjamin Netanyahu, India could be an influencer rather than a disruptor. But both Israel and Palestine also realise that the Modi era is finite. Hence, what is important is to ensure a continuum in the foreign policy rather than a hasty shift that could spoil India’s equilibrium in the region. Interestingly, both Israel and Palestine are calling the outreach a “love affair”, neither unable to fathom why is Modi giving the time of day to the other.","title":"National interest over ideology, but will India stay the course on Palestine?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-palestine-visit-gulf-israel-mahmoud-abbas-ramallah-benjamin-netanyahu/story/1/22269.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15280},{"author":"Nikhil Wagle","content":"There is a new spring in Sharad Pawar’s step ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief has already managed to cobble up an informal alliance, and we saw a glimpse of that at the January 26 \" \" march in Mumbai. Even though the rally was organised by MP Raju Shetty and MLC Jitendra Awhad, Pawar was the one pulling the strings. He personally made calls to the main Opposition leaders, ensuring the presence of the likes of Sharad Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Omar Abdullah, D Raja and so on. More importantly, the senior state Congress leaders too were present at the rally. If there is any chance of an Opposition unity, Pawar knows it isn’t possible without the backing of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. He was in touch with them from the beginning. On top of that, he even tweeted saying that the next moves would be decided after consulting Rahul Gandhi. Later, the Opposition leaders held two more meetings, one at Sonia Gandhi’s residence, and the other at Pawar’s. \r\n \r\n Known for his astuteness, Pawar’s strategy should be seen in the context of the dramatically changing political climate in India. According to an IndiaSpend analysis published recently, the BJP could be down to   from its unprecedented 282 seats. In the last four years, 15 states have witnessed Assembly elections. Those 15 states had fetched the BJP 191 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. But considering the downward popularity of the BJP in those states, along with trends in Gujarat Assembly elections and Rajasthan by-polls, the ruling party looks set to lose considerable vote share in 2019. In such a scenario, the non-BJP and non-Congress parties can make a considerable difference. If the BJP is restricted at around 225, and the Congress at 125, the remaining 193 seats could be crucial, and that is where Pawar comes into play. He enjoys excellent rapport with parties across the board, irrespective of their ideologies. And with BJP’s current allies such as the Shiv Sena, the TDP and the Akali Dal upset with Modi, Pawar could easily exploit the situation. Moreover, more than 100 BJP’s MPs are Congress turncoats. Smelling an opportunity, Pawar seems to have rekindled his dream of becoming the prime minister. He has been trying his luck since Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, however, only in vain. In 1991, Pawar took on PV Narasimha Rao in the leadership race. I was witness to these happenings in New Delhi. Pawar’s Man Friday, Suresh Kalmadi, tried his best even as  his industrialist friends extended their full support. But Narasimha Rao was equally shrewd and knew the Congress party better than Pawar. He defeated Pawar, made him defence minister and sent him back to Maharashtra after the 1993 blasts. Since then Pawar’s close associates have tried their best to revive his dream during each Parliament election except the 2014 battle. The Modi wave had seemingly demolished Pawar’s dream even before the race began. Pawar admitted this publicly several times. But now in a changed political scenario, the NCP veteran has become active once again. Of course, if you ask him that, he would deny it immediately. However, there are several impediments in the way of his PM dream. The biggest of them is his own credibility crisis, not just in Maharashtra, but across the country. Even Opposition leaders around him concede the fact that he cannot be trusted. Not too long ago, his party unconditionally supported the   government in Maharashtra from outside in 2014 and kept the minority BJP government afloat after the Assembly polls threw up a hung verdict. Also, his friendship with Modi is looked at with suspicion. And even though his relationship with Rahul Gandhi has improved in the recent past, to what extent will the Congress president repose his trust in Pawar is anybody’s guess. Further, how would the big Opposition leaders with even bigger egos work with each other? The TMC is currently the third-largest party in Lok Sabha. Mamata Banerjee’s hold over West Bengal is comfortable. Even though she sent her representative to Mumbai for the rally, she later said it is just a formality. Why would Banerjee accept Pawar’s leadership, who doesn’t even have 15 MPs? Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav will also ask the same question. Within a week of the Pawar-led march, Akhilesh Yadav conducted his own rally in Mumbai. Moreover, Akhilesh and Mayawati haven’t joined hands either. Even in Mumbai, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh chief and Dalit stalwart Prakash Ambedkar is not ready to repose his trust in Pawar. On top of that, leaders from the southern states remain unpredictable as ever. The ego battles between regional parties are historic and the country has seen it closely in 1977, 1989 and 1996. There is another possibility that cannot be neglected. If the BJP’s seats go down to a level where Modi cannot hold the allies together,   within the NDA could emerge as a preferred candidate to lead the country. The late PA Sangma’s son and NPP chief Conrad Sangma, has recently said that in as many words. (For the uninitiated, the National People's Party was formed by the veteran PA Sangma after he left the NCP, which he, along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar, founded in 1999 following their expulsion from the Congress for opposing Sonia Gandhi's leadership over her foreign origin. Pawar and Sangma later fell out after the NCP refused to back Sangma's candidature for President of India in 2012. An ally of the NDA, the NPP's influence is mostly concentrated in Meghalaya, which is going to Assembly polls on February 27.) Notwithstanding the ever-changing equations, Pawar in all likelihood will continue to play an important role.

Sheikh is the man behind the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul case in which a huge cache of arms and explosives to target political leaders were procured. Leads from Sheikh’s sustained interrogation have already helped the National Investigation Agency (NIA) make two vital arrests from Bihar’s Gopalganj district. The latest arrests were on Thursday when the premier investigating agency picked a suspected operative of terrorist outfit LeT from Gopalganj district for his alleged involvement in creating a sleeper cell of the banned organisation in Bihar. An NIA team from Delhi picked up one Mahfooz Alam from his house at Khajurbanni locality of Gopalganj, around 145km northwest of capital city Patna. Alam has been taken to Delhi for interrogation. Incidentally, this was NIA’s second arrest the same district in last two months after the agency picked one Bedar Bakht alias Dhannu Raja on December 1.  Both Alam and Bakht have been found to have assisted Sheikh, and provided logistic, financial support and shelter to him. The two also collected funds for Sheikh through international money transfer services. All these arrests have revealed an uncanny terror link to Gopalganj district, as Sheikh too had spent two years in this district from early 2015 to March 2017. These arrests have raised a flag about Bihar, as the intelligence agencies are said to be assessing what drew the terrorists to Gopalganj district. While he was in Gopalganj, Sheikh ran a private coaching institute in the Bihar town, where he indoctrinated youths and built sleeper cells of the banned terror outfit. Prior to making Bihar his base, Sheikh was arrested in West Bengal in 2007 while infiltrating into India from Bangladesh with two Pakistanis and one Kashmiri. He escaped from judicial custody in 2014 while being taken to Mumbai to the MCOCA court there. Investigations have revealed that while government agencies frantically searched for him after his escape, Sheikh was relatively safe, teaching spoken English at his Gopalganj-based coaching institute called Smart Learner. Sheikh, considered close to 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Abu Jindal, had obtained Aadhaar card, passport and PAN (Permanent Account Number) under a pseudonym of Suhail Khan alias Mohammad Ali. Incidentally, Nayeem’s story bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Md Tauseef Khan, the 30- something mastermind of the July 2008 Ahmedabad blast, who was arrested from Bihar’s Gaya district in September last year. Tauseef too had taken shelter in Bihar’s Gaya district and was working as a school-teacher after triggering explosions in Ahmedabad, which killed 56 people and injured over 200. Nayeem is also believed to have obtained fake certificates of secondary school to get his passport issued from the Patna regional passport office. The NIA is also questioning a number of district-level officials to find out how Abdul Nayeem Sheikh, a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, succeeded in getting a domicile certificate, driving license, matriculation certificate and passport issued in the assumed name of Suhail Khan. Incidentally, Bihar has its old connections with terror outfits. Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and another operative, Abdul Karim Tunda, were arrested from the Raxaul border in East Champaran district.

Let’s do the electoral math by placing the country into four clusters: 1) north and west; 2) south; 3) east; and 4) Northeast and union territories.  This comprises 12 states (Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh). Together they offer 259 seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 205 seats out of its overall tally of 282 seats from this 12-state, 259-seat cluster. This is therefore the make-or-break cluster for the BJP. In 2019 though, it can realistically expect to win only around 150 seats from these 12 key north-western states. That’s a fall of 55 seats over 2014 due to strong anti-incumbency, the Congress’ resurgence and the   across the region. Can it make up this large decline in the other zones?  The five are unlikely to provide a cushion. The BJP won 21 out of 129 available seats in the south in 2014. Karnataka provided 17 of these. Again realistically, the BJP is unlikely to increase its tally significantly in 2019. Kerala may offer the odd extra seat. Karnataka could even slip a little, leaving the BJP with around 20 seats in the south. Together in the first two clusters, the BJP’s tally could therefore total around 170.  The four key eastern states of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand could prove crucial for the BJP. In 2014, the BJP won 37 seats in these four states from 117 seats on offer. In 2019, it will rely heavily on seat-sharing with ally JD(U) to sweep Bihar. Odisha promises a rich harvest too with dissent at the top of Naveen Patnaik’s BJD giving the BJP an opening. West Bengal remains a distant prospect though the BJP is likely to make inroads as the Left continues to lose traction. Meanwhile, with Jharkhand, where the BJP won 12 out of 14 seats in 2014, still a safe bet, the BJP could increase its tally in the 117-seat east cluster from 37 seats in 2014 to around 45 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP’s overall tally in the first three clusters rises to around 215 seats.  The   has been a special focus for the BJP. In 2014, it won just eight out of 25 seats in the seven northeastern states and Sikkim - seven of them from Assam. The BJP-backed North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) has changed the situation dramatically. The party can expect to raise its tally to around 14 seats in 2019. The seven union territories (UTs), including Delhi NCT, contributed 11 out of 13 available seats to the BJP in 2014. That total is unlikely to change much, though Delhi could swing partially towards the Congress, giving the BJP around 25 out of 38 seats on offer in the fourth cluster. Thus, the four clusters, in a best-case scenario, are likely to provide the BJP with 240 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election (150+20+45+25). Caveat: a Mayawati-Mulayam-Congress mahagathbandhan, however unlikely, could significantly reduce the BJP’s tally in Uttar Pradesh, cutting its Lok Sabha numbers to the low 220s. Unpredictable events such as a positive verdict by the Supreme Court in the Ram Mandir case and escalation of a conflict with Pakistan could in turn change the electoral math in favour of the BJP. Clearly, the BJP with 220-240 seats will not be able to form a government without the support of NDA allies. The Shiv Sena, TDP, LJP, SAD and others have varying degrees of problems with the BJP. To form a stable NDA coalition, the BJP would need at least 50 seats from its allies, taking the alliance’s tally to around 270-290. With the JD(U), but without the Shiv Sena, even that may prove difficult. The Rajinikanth factor in Tamil Nadu though could play a decisive role if he allies with the NDA, making Shiv Sena support redundant. Now turn to the Congress. To win power, Rahul Gandhi will have to rely heavily on old and new UPA allies. Across our four clusters, the Congress will be lucky to win 85-90 seats overall. To be a credible challenger to form a UPA 3 government, the Congress will need the following eleven key allies: TMC, the Left, DMK, SP, RJD, BSP, JD(S), AIMIM, NC, NCP and TRS. Defections from the NDA’s disgruntled allies would be welcome. Again, taking a best-case scenario, despite the unlikely prospect of the BSP and SP as well as the Left and TMC cohabiting in UPA 3, the 11 key allies together with smaller Congress-leaning parties are unlikely to garner more than 120 seats. Even if the Congress doubles its own tally to 90 seats, a putative UPA 3 would have only 210 Lok Sabha seats in all (90+120) - far short of a working majority. The way forward for the Congress therefore is to win at least 150 seats on its own as it did in 2004. Then only will it be able to cobble together a workable UPA 3 coalition in 2019 with over 270 seats (150 Congress plus 120 allies). In 2004, the Left with 60 seats supported the 145-seat Congress from outside. Other UPA 1 allies made up the numbers. In 2019, though relatively weakened, the BJP will still win far more than the 138 seats it won in 2004. At our estimate of 220-240 seats, the BJP can effectively thwart a potential UPA 3 - unless the Congress nearly quadruples its 2014 tally of 44 to well over 150. There just aren’t enough UPA allies to make up the slack as there were in 2004 with the Left’s 60 seats plumetting in 2014 to just nine. In 2019, the largest UPA ally will be the TMC with 30-odd seats. For the BJP, the message is clear. Five consecutive mediocre Budgets have alienated the middle class. They count for little electorally, but have a disproportionate influence on the political narrative. The BJP’s policies over the past 45 months have been a mixed bag: in sum, it has failed to deliver maximum governance and minimum government. It has less than a year to reverse the slide. The Lok Sabha election may well be advanced to December 2018 along with the key state polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in order to mask strong anti-incumbency. The BJP though does have one trump card: a still-anaemic Congress. But it can’t rely on that forever. To win re-election, the BJP will have to perform. Or perish.","title":"Why Modi faces rocky road to 272 in 2019 Lok Sabha elections","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-2019-lok-sabha-elections-bjp-nda-allies-disgruntled-272-mark/story/1/22234.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15283},{"author":"Harsh V Pant","content":"Crisis in the Maldives escalated this week after President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of Emergency and asked the military troops to arrest two top judges and detain former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition. Last week the nation’s Supreme Court had ordered the release of nine imprisoned Opposition politicians on the ground that their trials were politically motivated and flawed. The government refused to implement the ruling which led to widespread demonstrations in Male and clashes between the police and protesters. Calling President Yameen’s announcement “unconstitutional and illegal”, exiled former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed, the country’s first democratically-elected leader, has urged India to “act swiftly” to resolve the crisis. In some ways, Yameen’s actions are understandable as his options after the Supreme Court ruling were limited. The court verdict not only paves the way for Nasheed to return from his exile in Colombo and run for the presidency this year but also makes Yameen’s impeachment potentially plausible. Yameen must be calculating that with help of friends of like China, he would be able to ride over the crisis that would emerge with his declaration of Emergency. The alacrity with which the Maldives embraced China seems to have caught India off guard. But New Delhi’s engagement with Male has been hesitant of late and China has made the most of it. During Yameen’s China visit last year, the two nations signed 12 pacts, including a free trade agreement. Yameen also fully endorsed China’s ambitious Maritime Silk Road initiative. President Xi Jinping declared that “China deems the Maldives as an important partner” in this initiative and Yameen repaid the favour by claiming that the Maldives viewed China “among (its) closest friends” and that “the Belt and Road Initiative has greatly helped the development of many small and medium countries”. At a time when China’s belt and road initiative is beginning to attract scrutiny around the world, with even erstwhile supporters calling for a reassessment, such an endorsement is much sought after by Beijing. The Maldives became the second country in South Asia, after Pakistan, to enter into a free trade agreement with China. The Yameen government pushed the FTA through the nation’s Parliament, the Majlis, stealthily, with the Opposition not attending the parliamentary session. The principal Opposition party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that it was “deeply concerned over sudden and rushed Free Trade Agreement with China, without any disclosure of details to the public or to the MPs”. The concerns of the Opposition centre around a possible increase in the trade deficit, already tilted in favour of China, and the strategic direction of the country. The MDP has argued that it is worried “that further entrenchment of the country into a Chinese debt trap will result in additional stress on strategic national assets and increasing instability in the Indian Ocean region”. But that is where Yameen wants to take his country, it seems. On the one hand, he has been flirting with Islamist extremism and on the other, he wants to use closer ties with China to shield his government from global criticism. After the first-ever visit by a Chinese President to the Maldives in 2014, it officially became a part of the \"21st-century Maritime Silk Road.\" China quickly expanded its economic profile in the Maldives by building mega infrastructure projects, including the development of Hulhule island and a bridge connecting it to Male as well as the country’s main international airport. A constitutional amendment allowing foreign ownership of freehold land was passed in 2015, which can potentially enhance Chinese military presence in the island nation. Already, Chinese naval ships have become regular visitors to Male. During his 2016 visit to Delhi, Yameen had said his country pursues an “India first” foreign policy, describing it as the Maldives’s most important friend. But that was just after India had shielded the Yameen government from punitive action by the Commonwealth’s human rights and democracy oversight body. New Delhi’s recent policy of engaging with the Maldivian Opposition, especially the former President, Mohammad Nasheed, may be causing heartburn in Male and so the outreach to China has intensified. The Maldives remains the only country in South Asia which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to visit. There were many in India who had been critical of the Modi government’s light touch approach vis-à-vis Yameen over the last few years as he systematically worked at destroying the foundations of democracy in his country. But New Delhi had other interests to preserve in the archipelago nation. Now the moment of reckoning has come for both New Delhi and Yameen. India’s suggestion that the Supreme Court’s ruling should be promptly implemented was clearly given a short shrift by Yameen. New Delhi will have to intervene cautiously. A coordinated response with other like-minded regional and extra-regional players will be the first step. But like in the past, New Delhi should not be shy of using coercive diplomacy if only to underscore that ignoring India’s warnings comes at a price. The logic of geography dictates that India’s role will be critical in determining the trajectory of political developments in the Maldives.

So do nations. Nothing manifested that better than the congregation of the super rich, their global affluence evident as their private jets swooped into the Swiss Alps at Davos, an annual bash of eclectic celebrity capitalists where India was supposedly doing a showstopper-walk, and the tragic suicide of  , an 84-year-old beleaguered farmer from Maharashtra who committed suicide amid the hustle-bustle of Mumbai's non-stop irrepressible energy. There could not have been a more apposite paradox to explain India's inherent contradictions. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made another of his highfalutin speeches to hard-sell India (even as India Inc palpably serenaded him on bent knees, despite the snow), but appeared blissfully unaware of some hard economic data that had surfaced concomitantly from the organisers, the World Economic Forum itself. India's ranking in the Inclusive Development Index had slumped to 62; an appalling commentary on the skewed policies of the last four years of Mr Modi's government which has increased social disparities. Not surprisingly, it seemed to synchronise with the astonishing fact that  . US President Donald Trump followed Modi to justify his America First pitch to the august gathering of essentially free-market fundamentalists. Like India, America has seen an escalating income inequality, ironically electing a tax-evading, anti-free trade, ultra-nationalist avatar in a billionaire businessman with a dubious track-record as its man in the White House. Politics is indeed weird. Even as India's stock markets breached stratospheric levels crossing 35,000 levels prompting pink papers to go into uncontrollable euphoria, Dharma Patil lay dead at JJ hospital. The state government of Maharashtra had refused to respond to his several entreaties for help after it acquired his land for a pathetic pittance. It was unconscionable. The opposition blamed the government of Devendra Fadnavis for culpable homicide; in effect, it was callous nonchalance to a desperate cry for help. It was a stark reminder of one Gajendra Singh from Rajasthan who hung himself from a tree while an election rally proceeded with much fanfare in New Delhi. It was an ugly manifestation of a society that had forgotten its once revered creator of the rice bowl. Evidently, we have chosen to turn a blind eye to the hapless farmer, once deserving of a national call; Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. Arun Jaitley, India's Finance Minister, who famously declared that India will double farmers' income in five years, has been extraordinarily silent on his progress report. Perhaps that is understandable given that after four years of the Modi government , the average agricultural growth is just 1.9 per cent. To achieve the ambitious growth levels projected with profuse showmanship by the government, a minimum of 12 per cent is needed. The target is ridiculously off the curve, but ask any policy wonk and he will tell you that it is always a preposterous kite-flying exercise. That begs the question, have we become so politically immoral that we make even suffering farmers dream of bountiful profits when in fact it is nothing more than a mirage, a chimera? Or are Indian politicians, once elected, decoupled from ground realities? In his farewell budget on February 1, 2018, Mr Jaitley made another grandiloquent claim; that his government had successfully provided for minimum support price of 50 per cent over cost-of-crop production as it had promised in its 2014 manifesto. It seemed like a stunning apocryphal story, because the definition of the cost of production had been deliberately left ambiguous. The convenient formula was adopted, but based on that measure, the farmers were getting 50 per cent over MSP since the UPA days. In that case, what was Modi promising during the 2014 election campaign? At the time of writing, very few in the mainstream media have even questioned this brazen inconsistency. Mr Modi also magnanimously laid out the red carpet for foreign investors citing India's charming hospitality and tranquil environs. But back home it was anything but. The release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's   was meshed in  , and agitating Karni Sena supporters had become official non-state actors, as several BJP state governments happily catapulted to their intimidating threat to not release the controversial film. Chopping off heads of those who were related to the film was publicly broadcasted by these insidious hate groups, but the prime minister did not think a strong condemnation was necessary. Despite a scathing indictment from the Supreme Court, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh refused to screen the film, citing law and order risks. It was tantamount to acquiescing that they were incapable of ensuring governance, despite having the full police force under their authority. The world could see the farcical melodrama turning violent, but India's elected leaders did not budge. What was once classified as right wing fringe was now a legitimate mainstream disruptor, courtesy official umbrage. Their poisonous footprint is on the rise, as punitive action has not been taken. At last count the film was headed for blockbuster box-office collections, and the Rajput community had not found anything offensive enough about it. So what was the purpose behind the belligerent posturing? And why did Indian politicians play ball? But on the day of the hugely hyped budget, something remarkable happened. Even as Mr Jaitley gave his budget speech, from nearby Rajasthan, people spoke in collective unison, condemning both the wilful neglect of the farming community and the senseless mayhem over a commercial film. The BJP got a   in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat. The voters had seen through their forked tongue that sells stardust dreams even as it deliberately ignores solving the real issues. February 1 was a reminder that Indian democracy was still alive. And that Dharma Patil's death would not be forgotten.","title":"Why India needs to remember a farmer forgotten by Modi government","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/income-disparity-modi-government-dharma-patil-arun-jaitley-padmaavat-davos/story/1/22182.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15285},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"Tamil has been on MK Stalin's mind this week. At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ","title":"Hindi is becoming a rallying point in Tamil Nadu politics again","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tamil-mk-stalin-hindi-tamil-nadu-karunanidhi-madras-high-court-anti-hindi-agitation/story/1/22178.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15286},{"author":"M Reyaz","content":"One of the top trends on Twitter on Saturday was #AnkitSaxena, a 23-year old young photographer from Delhi   by the family members of the 20-year old girl he was allegedly in a relationship with for three years. No, Ankit's case was not trending merely to demand justice for the victim's family or as a debate over the law and order situation in the national capital. Not even because some custodians of culture and tradition are supporting the murderers or because Twitterati are outraged over the \"honour killing\". Ankit's case has instead given the right wing and their whole politics grounds to demonise and target the community they love to hate. Ankit's girlfriend Shehzadi was a Muslim. His killers, the girl's father, mother, uncle and a minor brother also come from the same faith. She had allegedly locked her family members in the house and fled after an argument. The enraged father, accompanied by other family members, came out with a knife in his hand and found Ankit, who lived nearby in west Delhi, on a scooter. A scuffle started. According to the police, as the family members held Ankit tightly, the father of the girl slit his throat. All accused have already been arrested, and a case has been filed at the local police station in west Delhi. One hopes that the law will take its course and the aggrieved family will get justice. What is troubling is that instead of asking for justice certain media and the right wing forces are using the case to bash the entire Muslim community and they are being forced to condemn the gruesome incident. So far only in terror cases guilt by association was raised to target one community, but even though not one person has spoken in support of the murderers, the whole community is being demonised and bashed. Imagine for a moment that the boy was Muslim and girl a Hindu, the right wing would have justified the incident in the name of a purported case of \"love jihad\". On the contrary, I have not come across any Muslim on social media justifying the murder; rather they have all expressed shock, some have condemned it and demanded swift action from the police. It is rather ironical that the same people who are targeting the Muslim community would be asking people to celebrate on February 14, the Valentine's Day, as \"Matri Pitri Poojan Diwas\", and have called Hadiya a victim of love jihad. Religion must have played an important role in the decision of Shehzadi's family to not accept their daughter's choice, but it is more of a patriarchal problem than anything else. I have written earlier, how families find any pretext under the sky to  . Our society at large has still not come to terms with the fact that adult men and women can themselves make a better decision in choosing their life partner, and would rather get them married to people of their choice. The so-called   is one of most dishonourable things for any society that claims to be civilised, irrespective of religion or creed or caste. Professor Dibyesh Anand of Westminster University rightly pointed out after the incident, \"The lethal concept is not a religion but proprietorial-patriarchal-family-honour that afflicts many Hindus, Muslims, and others alike.\" Killing a daughter or her partner for defying them is not unique to any one community but is a larger malaise in our part of the world that sadly often has sanctions from religious leaders as well as community formations such as khap panchayats. Only in January, there was a report of a (Hindu)   as he had dared to marry the girl from another caste. And ironically on the same day Ankit was murdered, I saw a  , of a woman being savagely flogged for an alleged extramarital affair. There is a lesson we can all learn from Ankit's father, Yashpal Saxena. He , who reportedly visited the family, \"I do not have hatred against any community.

The Opposition has claimed that Patil consumed the poison outside chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s office at the sixth floor of Mantralaya as the government failed to deliver justice to him. Patil had received compensation of Rs 4 lakh for his five-acre farm whereas his neighbour Kisan Girase got Rs 1.98 crore for one-acre farmland, though both of them had planted mango trees. The case has exposed the chinks in the state’s administration as well as the unholy practices adopted while granting compensation to land. Girase stands accused of paying a bribe of Rs 1 crore to the officials from land acquisition department to get higher compensation. At the same time, a nexus between officials and land-selling agents also has come to fore. Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar admits that the nexus exists. “The government does not make any discrimination between the beneficiaries. It is the officials who misinterpret and take disadvantage of the government schemes,” he told me. It has become a trend over a couple of years to plant mango trees in farm land to increase its value at the time of land acquisition even though the climate does not suit the trees. Water resources minister Girish Mahajan points that agents purchase land from poor farmers at throwaway prices, “import” mango trees from Konkan and demand higher price at the time of acquisition. The mango trees are literally “replanted” to create an impression that they exist in a particular farm land for many years. As per rules, if a farm land has mango trees its values grows multifold. In some cases, the government has given Rs 1 crore for one acre farm land when the actual price was Rs 10 lakh because of the mango trees. “This is not possible without the direct involvement of government officials,” Mahajan admitted. “They know it better which land would be acquired for which project.” He pointed that the government had carried survey of the proposed super communication highway between Nagpur and Mumbai, known as Samruddhi Corridor, using Google maps to count the number of trees on the patch before the project was announced. “If we had not done that the agents would have replanted mango trees everywhere on the corridor making the project economically unviable,” Mahajan said. The government has reserved Rs 10,000 crore only for compensation to land acquisition. The nexus exists for a long time. Patil’s case has given the government an opportunity to break it once and all.  (Courtesy of  )","title":"It's rotten.

A grand scheme intended to tackle an incredibly serious policy issue with almost no details of know-how in the public domain. Yet, it was celebrated as if the outcome it sought had already been achieved. Yesterday (February 1) seemed no different. Once again we forgot what   was good at: fooling us with lofty goals with a tinge of morality added to it. “Modicare”, as it’s now being touted, seeks to provide health insurance to about 100 million “vulnerable” families across India. About 40 per cent of the country’s population (or 500 million beneficiaries) will be \"protected\" under the scheme. Yet somehow its being touted as a system of universal healthcare. A universal scheme should generally cover all citizens, but that’s a matter of separate debate. Unsurprisingly, it overshadowed pretty much everything else in the discussions around the Budget (including a higher fiscal deficit, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax and changes to custom duties for about 50 items). It was supposedly the \"aha moment\" of the  for many TV news anchors and commentators. The general consensus was that the poor and the destitute end up spending a large portion of their income on secondary and tertiary healthcare and that the government is right in providing a helping hand. Imagine if they don’t need to save for a rainy day? Imagine if they are free to use that money to consume goods and services? Imagine what would it do to accelerate growth, and thereby generate greater revenue? Undoubtedly, all of these instances are possible, but it requires a rock-solid combination of detailed plans, smooth execution, a big pot of cash and a ton of luck. Unfortunately, the way our governments are designed, its hard if not impossible to hit such a sweet spot. In this case as well, no basic plan has been charted out yet. The current plan is to draft a plan in the next six months. In terms of execution, it’s best not to glorify government’s notoriously poor record in implementation of schemes. As for cash, the government could easily end up spending thousands of crores of rupees (maybe a lot more depending on premiums). Where will the money come for it is anyone’s guess. But what seems eerily similar to demonetisation is that no cost-benefit analysis of the scheme seems to have been done. And just like demonetisation, this will most certainly become BJP’s major talking point during elections. Leaving aside these minor technicalities, one has to seriously ask if 500 million individuals in India need mandatory insurance from the government? Sure, no one is arguing against not providing subsidy to those below poverty line (and maybe others). But what about those who can? Wouldn’t they be better off left alone in deciding their choice of insurance and allow the government to use the valuable tax revenue for an alternative purpose? Choice matters as that will allow greater competition amongst private/public insurance companies and not just benefit those who are contracted with the government. India has only so many resources at hand and it would have been ideal to allow states to chart their own course (health is a state subject) rather than initiate a massive scheme from the top. Secondly, most debates moved around the ifs and buts on the health coverage. Not many offered a view from an ideological and principled standpoint. It’s rather easy to get bothered by questions around the government’s ability to fund or implement the project, but its far more important to ask if the government should sponsor such a scheme at all. A similar scheme was proposed in 2016 which offered a coverage of Rs 30,000 per family. That has now been raised to Rs 5 lakh per family. Those in Opposition can always offer another substantial hike until we will reach a point of no return. What are the chances that the government will do away with such a mandate even when most Indians will easily be able to afford it? Third, instead of focusing on drafting policies (reforming land, labour and capital) that would eventually pull people out of poverty and allow them to make enough money to pay for their own and family’s health/education, the government is creating another tax-payer funded entitlement. Yes, both (growth and redistribution) can go on simultaneously, but there is just not enough noise and movement on the former. What looks probable right now is that we will go through another loop of good intentions and bad outcomes. But considering how lucky PM Modi is (and was through the execution of demonetisation), it may just work in his favour, of course electorally.","title":"Budget 2018: How achievable is Arun Jaitley's promise of health cover for 500 million poor Indians?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/health-insurance-union-budget-arun-jaitley-demonetisation-november-8-2016-modi-election-promise/story/1/22143.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15289},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"Going into the last full Union Budget of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only bet on the farmers, but bet the farm on his rural voters. Articulating his vision for the general election of 2019 quite clearly, he has recognised the existence of rural distress, amplified by a string of farmer protests and suicides last year provoked by falling commodity prices and increasing debt. Hoping to deliver on his promise to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, the Budget has shown every intention of boosting farmers’ incomes by raising the minimum support price for crops to 1.5x the cost of production, liberalising export of agri-commodities, and modernising agricultural markets. This comes in the wake of agri-GDP registering an insipid average annual growth rate of 2 per cent in the first three years of the Modi government - in the last three years of the UPA rule, it was nearly twice this figure. The second clear narrative in Modi Vision 2019 is the creation of jobs. The Budget has seen a push to small businesses, which were badly hit both by demonetisation and the initial implementation of GST. The corporate tax reduction for firms with turnovers below Rs 250 crore as well as Rs 3,794 crore in credit support to MSMEs could help. The continuing push to infrastructure, with expected investments in excess of Rs 50 lakh crore in roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways, is also of a piece with this strong effort - unemployment emerged as the biggest concern among respondents to the India Today Mood of the Nation Poll last week, along with rising prices. Equally clear is the government’s belated recognition of the importance of healthcare and education. As Amartya Sen says, no developed country in the world has progressed without investing in these key areas. On education, the Budget has announced Eklavya schools for tribals as well as 24 new medical colleges and 1,000 new fellowships for doctoral students. In healthcare, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an ambitious National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide up to Rs 5 lakh per year to 100 million families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. Impressive as this sounds, I am not sure the mechanisms or details of funding have been worked out. The expense could be monumental. There is a disconcertingly familiar sense of too many announcements and too little implementation. Take the example of the Smart Cities Mission, announced in 2015, which aimed at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-the-art amenities. So far, 99 cities have been selected with an outlay of Rs 2.04 lakh crore. But projects worth a mere Rs 2,350 crore have been completed. The rest remain \"in progress\". That’s a pathetic strike rate, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the government’s ability to deliver. Given the additional spending, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019 will require disinvestment and the highest ever gross taxes as a percentage of GDP. It is a tough ask, according to Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi, one of the eminent economists in our panel of commentators, but not entirely unachievable. The Budget has nothing for the middle class and large corporates, who in many ways are the bulwark of the economy. The big question is, whether all this will be enough - especially given that the GDP growth rate is expected to fall to 6.75 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to 7.1 the previous year. So far, the economic environment was conducive, but now oil prices have crossed $70 a barrel internationally, and retail inflation has breached the RBI’s target, hitting 5.21 per cent in December. Also, there is nothing to spur the investment rate which has fallen from a peak of nearly 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 26.4 per cent in 2017-18. Unless the government is able to move the needle on this, it is difficult to imagine the accelera­tion in economic growth so necessary to finance its ambitious schemes. My own nagging concern is an old one: I am not sure how much of government expenditure actually reaches the intended beneficiary. In 1985, on a visit to drought-affected Kalahandi in Odisha, the late Rajiv Gandhi said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reached the intended recipient. Has that leaky bucket been fixed? If not, the electoral benefits this government is hoping  for after this Budget may not materialise. Elections are not won on grand announcements or manifestos, but on real development on the ground which people can feel.

And when she’s not working, meaning governing the state or minding politics, she is into creative pursuits — writing books, penning lyrics, composing songs, painting and doodling. Mamata Banerjee has been recently awarded the prestigious DLitt by Calcutta University for her versatile contribution in the field of literature and language and for her gigantic footprints in social work. There was much hue and cry, storm over tea stalls, debates dragging into court as to whether she merited the honorary degree. Ultimately she got the degree and she accepted it teary-eyed and her voice choking, partly for the love and appreciation of a section of people, who considered her eligible, and partly for the insult, humiliation and barbs she had to face in the process. Without going into the sanctity of the awardee, the literary merit of her work, which can be purely subjective (depending on who are judging it, on what basis, under what condition and who are conferring the title), one cannot deny the sheer numbers she has added to the world of printed letters. Half a dozen books a year is child’s play for her and she has been spewing such volume at every Kolkata Book Fair. And for all her detractors crying foul, the books are published by a leading publishing house of Bengal and they are always bestsellers — well at least as per the records of the publishing house. This year too, as the city warms up to another book fair, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is coming out again with not less than half a dozen new publications. She has a volume of already 70 published works and this year it will increase to 76. And think of the range, she has something for everyone: names of babies for would-be or new parents, rhyme-books for toddlers,   for children,   (voice of heart) Urdu shayaris for the youth,   — something about personality development of the young generation, and   (exhorting the young brigade to consider politics as a noble profession) to travelogues ( ) for the trotting community. Her memoirs on struggle —  , the tidbits of bitter-sweet memories of life —  , her youth, desires sacrificed at the altar of politics — Bikel Hnariye Geche (a personal note on how the sweet spring has slipped by), and   — a compilation of quotable quotes on the philosophy and ideology of her life, an allusion to Kathamrita — quotes of Ram Krishna Dev for the spiritually inclined, are her other book. Not to be missed is the historical documentation of important landmark events from the political work — Nandi Ma (the land movement in Nandigram), Singur, Kutshapokksho (Rumour Mongers), a commentary on how the Opposition and the BJP-led Centre were engaged in a slandering campaign to malign her on the eve of 2016 Assembly, Notebandi (Demonetisation) and this year its   (intolerance). Though the majority of the political memoirs are political campaign on her sweat and labour and the string of achievements she has been weaving in, Asohishnuta is an interesting record of the environment of hatred, fear and intolerance unleashed by the saffron party both in the country and her state. The diversity of subject and magnitude of work apart, one should not miss the proficiency of language, the ease with which she nimbly moves through languages, Bengali, English, Urdu and Ol Chiki, some of her books are being translated into Ol Chiki. So if these are not grounds, solid enough to confer her the D.litt, what are? As for the sceptical and high-browed critics, especially those who are deprecating, the Calcutta University as the conferring body chose to seal all probable leaks. The award has been given by virtue of her literary works and her social welfare activities, which have been acknowledged internationally and she has even got the prestigious UN Public Service award for Kanyashree — the scheme for empowering women. The DLitt debate has been dismissed by the court perhaps because it realised that wisdom lies in closing the chapter. After all, there is nothing new in conferring titles and awards to political personalities, great administrators and statesman and it has been the practice all over the world. When men of letters like Dr Mammohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and legends like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi get awarded, the country bursts into euphoria, and rightly so. But the feeling definitely cannot be the same when Akshay Kumar (University of Windsor in 2008) and Shilpa Shetty Kundra flaunt one or godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim claims a doctorate title from some little known UK university. The fact that PM Narendra Modi declined to be awarded a doctorate by BHU in 2016 at the peak of his popularity in recognition of him being a reformer and an outstanding leader in public service and governance is a rare, pragmatic thing. Had he accepted he would have invited similar muck throwing as happened in the case of Mamata.

At least, that was his poll promise of \"na goondaraj, na bhrashtachar (freedom from goons and corruption)\" to the state. However, this year's Republic Day clashes tell a very different story altogether. As residents of Kasganj, belonging to different communities, began preparing for the 69th Republic Day celebrations, a group of ABVP and VHP cadres set out on a bike rally. Passing through every mohalla, they finally reached Baliram Gate. This group, which had no police permission, was also carrying saffron flags - enough to instigate a communal outburst. As they approached the minority-dominated area, their slogans grew louder. Soon, what started out as a verbal spat turned into a violent clash with both sides throwing stones at the other. One man reached for his gun and fired in frenzy which hit 20-year-old Chandan Gupta, killing him two hours later. Another man, Naushad, was also hit in the leg by a bullet and is now recovering at an Aligarh hospital. This was enough to trigger the mob, which went on a rampage across the town. The district police force was in Etah for the Republic Day parade as the town erupted into flames. A mosque was set ablaze and the police, in an FIR, said stones were hurled and bullets fired on them as they tried to quell the commotion. By afternoon, Yogi's promise of \"na goondaraj\" was blown into pieces as shops and buses burning to cinders became the image of Kasganj. The police, unable to control the situation, imposed curfew to restrict mob movement. One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and five companies of Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) along with police forces from adjoining districts were deployed in Kasganj. The district magistrate, inspector-general of police, commissioner of Aligarh and at least half a dozen other IPS officers from adjoining areas were deputed to control the surging violence. But all these measures had no bearing on the rapidly deteriorating condition of Kasganj. Around 9.30pm, Lakhimpur resident Mohammad Akram, unaware of the violence, was on his way home with his pregnant wife in a Tata Safari. As he reached Kasganj, the mob attacked his car. They broke the windows with bamboo sticks and almost gouged out his left eye. \"They saw my beard and attacked me. My wife is expecting and the delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,\" Akram said, his face covered in blood. Akram was attacked in the middle of the town, Agrasen Gate, and the police was absolutely unaware of the situation. Fortunately, the local correspondent of Aaj Tak, Devesh Pal Singh, who was present there informed a senior police officer even as he recorded a video on his mobile phone. By this time, the mob had already put kerosene on Akram and his pregnant wife in an attempt to burn them alive. The senior officer responded swiftly and sent his forces just in time to save them. Akram is now recuperating in a hospital. Just 50 metres from here, BJP MP Rajveer Singh, along with a few other legislators, district magistrate and police officers were at the residence of Chandan Gupta, requesting them to cremate Chandan's body, but the family was struck to their demand of \"status of martyrdom\" for their dead son. The deadlock ended around 2am after the family was given verbal assurance of a government job to a family member and Rs 50 lakh as compensation. However, three days after his death, Chandan's family has received a cheque of Rs 20 lakh. On January 27, Chandan was cremated in the morning and even as his mortal remains were set on the pyre, Kasganj continued to burn. Around 200 meters from the cremation ground, one bus and a shop were set on fire while some locals vandalised a garage. Minutes later, three more buses and three shops were set ablaze by them. All the shops and vehicles were owned by the local Muslim population who till one day ago were living peacefully with the Hindus.  What was shocking was that these incidents were taking place within a range of 500 metres from where hundreds of policemen and two companies of paramilitary forces were standing guard.  As we witnessed, it appeared that a section of the locals belonging to a particular community were given a free hand by the local administration, allowing them to go on a rampage against the minorities.   Parliamentarian Rajveer Singh in a statement to us blamed the Muslims for the clashes. \"Muslims are responsible for this incident. It was pre-planned and they will be dealt with strict action,\" he said. Virendra Tomar, VHP leader, said, \"It's time for us to give a fitting reply to \"love jihad\". If they kill one of us, we will kill 10 of them. The police is our servant and they will work on our instructions.\" After several incidents of violence since the morning of January 27, the mob, led by a local VHP leader, took on the policemen. With no courage to face the crowd, a senior police officer called a VHP leader and requested him to ask their cadres to vacate the streets. The VHP leader agreed to the officer's request, but while walking away, he warned the police that within 48 hours, they will ensure that Kasganj is on fire. The political conspiracy was quite clear following the clashes which started on January 26. Now, there was only pressure from the innocent locals and media on the administration and police officers to act.  On January 28, when we confronted the suprintendent of police, Sunil Singh (who has now been transferred), as to why they failed to control the situation, he categorically said, \"This is being done on the instructions of a few people (higher-ups) and I cannot rule out any political conspiracy.\" His statement on camera probably cost him his job as he was transferred from Kasganj. Politics over Kasganj violence is at its peak with BJP and VHP leaders making controversial remarks, and parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party blaming the BJP for polarisation for the upcoming elections. In this political tussle, the ones suffering are the common people. Situated on the banks of Kala Nadi (Black river), most of the population in Kasganj is dependent on daily business for their survival. With a population of little above one million, Kasganj district has approximately 66 per cent Hindus and 33 per cent Muslims. And in last one decade, there has been no incident of any communal violence. Five days on, Kanganj continues to simmer while politicians are busy trying to cash in on communal sentiments.  ","title":"How politics is fanning the communal flames in Kasganj","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kasganj-violence-mohammad-akram-pregnant-wife-district-magistrate-sunil-singh-transferred-yogi-adityanath/story/1/22090.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15292},{"author":"AVM Manmohan Bahadur","content":"Technological asymmetry has been an understated cog that goes into deciding victors in interstate conflicts — for, it is finally the image of a victorious soldier, sailor or airman that lingers — on in human memory. While the \"man behind the machine\" is important, there comes a stage where the superiority of warfighting implements overcomes the prowess of a warrior. We have witnessed that when the bow and arrow overcame the mightiest of land warriors only to be overcome itself by the lance; the bow, lance, sword, shield et al were steamrolled when gun powder came on the scene. And so has been the story over centuries leading to tanks, submarines and now air power, whose instruments have become deciding factors in winning battles and affecting the way war progresses. Adverse technological asymmetry has been fatal down history; India is in the dangerous position of getting on the wrong side of the tech asymmetry curve vis-a-vis its neighbours, especially China — this should be lighting up red bulbs in South Block. The Chinese military-industrial complex has matured to a point where it has become the world’s third largest major arms exporter. Though this is especially true in the field of air defence systems, UAVs and mid-capability fighter and transport aircraft. While the J-20 stealth aircraft has been inducted (production rate being ramped to 36 aircraft per year) and is going through its operational paces, there are reports that the J-31 is being converted to become a carrier borne stealth fighter. This would affect Indian naval power adversely as there are no reports of a corresponding development for the Indian Navy, which is still debating after the shelving of the Naval Tejas programme, whether to get more trouble prone MiG-29K for the indigenous aircraft carrier or some other foreign aircraft. The Chinese have produced the sixth Y-20 Very Heavy Transport Aircraft which will become the mainstay of long range airlift as well as the base aircraft for AWACS and inflight refuelling. They have tied up with the Russians for making a new Advanced Heavy Lift helicopter for the Tibetan plateau and have bought from Ukraine, lock stock and barrel, rights to the world’s biggest transport aircraft, the An-225. The massive airlift capability that will accrue to the PLA can well be imagined! Secure communications, that are so vital in war, will become their forte with research being done in quantum technology. Similar advancements are happening in the land and naval armament arena but the advantage that India presently has with its superior aircraft and aircrew over its Northern frontiers may be slowly slipping away. Air power assets do not come cheap and it is necessary that a nation, vying for a seat at the table of the powerful, commits enough monies towards their acquisition. While the depleting squadron strength of the IAF is being regularly debated, it is the other equally vital aspects too that merit government’s attention. We have only three AWACS and six Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and no additional ones on the horizon. This writer is witness to the selection of a new FRA in 2009, but the proposal was shot down on \"high\" costs. The reshoot of the project met a similar fate five years hence and now we have floated another tender last week! Will this be cheaper now? No way! Reports from HAL about the ramping up of Tejas are not encouraging and prototype testing of the Tejas Mk1A, eighty-three of which will be bought, is some distance away. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft seems a mirage while the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft project is still on the drawing board. The real silver lining is the transport aircraft and helicopter fleets of the IAF that constitute a very potent airlift capability, but these aircraft too are all imported – hopefully, their maintenance contracts are being addressed in time to have adequate availability on the flight line. A healthy combat-ready flight line demonstrates the deterrence that air power affords a nation. The forthcoming national budget is awaited with great anticipation by the armed forces. Technological asymmetry should not be allowed to handicap our first-rate war fighters. : The Economic Survey for 2017-18 brings out the startling fact that India spends only 0.7 per cent of its GDP on Research & Development while China spends 2.1 per cent, the US 2.8 per cent and Israel 4.3 per cent. If the R&D spend is worked out in monetary terms the huge difference between China and India would be abundantly clear as Beijing’s GDP is five times India’s. It is a no-brainer that this is a clear indicator of the fact that technological asymmetry would only increase unless some radical steps are urgently taken by the government to ameliorate the imbalance.

After all, pooh-poohed its strategic experts, the first iteration a decade ago was short-lived and fizzled out. The Quad’s second coming, however, has so far appeared more robust — or robust enough to concern Beijing. Two top officials who travelled to Delhi in December — state councillor Yang Jiechi and foreign minister Wang Yi — both made oblique references to the danger of “small groups” getting together with the aim of containing others. They both also referred to what they saw as unhelpful meddling by the US in the South China Sea and hoped India would continue its “independent” foreign policy. So, when four top naval officials of the Quad countries took the stage together in Delhi in January’s Raisina Dialogue, Beijing duly saw red. Especially when the commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, openly called China a disruptor, and Japan’s naval chief Admiral Kawano called for countries to come together to counter Chinese naval expansionism amid muscle-flexing in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The hawkish Chinese tabloid   wrote that “the Raisina Dialogue was elaborately planned to serve as a platform for countries like the US, Japan and Australia, to show their tough stance towards China and Russia, and meanwhile demonstrate India’s position of trying to balance between Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region, in addition to India’s independent major power status and dissatisfaction with China.” The unprecedented joint attendance of 10 ASEAN leaders, days later at the Republic Day parade in Delhi, further deepened the angst in Beijing, with the same newspaper in an editorial raging that “some members of the Indian elite enjoy engaging in geopolitical bluster. But they cannot truly gauge the reality of India’s comprehensive strength and diplomatic experience. They are beginners playing at geopolitics.” “New Delhi is not Beijing’s major trading partner, and, despite border disputes, is not an imminent security threat to us Chinese,” the editorial said. “However, some Indians keep pestering us, asking us to acknowledge that India is developing better than China.” New Delhi, with a GDP that’s only one-fifth of China’s, has been striving to prevail over Beijing in almost all aspects.” It concluded, “Honestly speaking, Chinese people are not occupied by India.” But apparently occupied enough to warrant a stream of concerned editorials in the state media.

Both Dalit leaders - one from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the other from Gujarat - they are charismatic young men who offer possibilities of a new and vibrant Dalit movement in a national landscape as riven by caste as ever. Both are lawyers, both are Ambedkarite - Azad more than Mevani - and both are modern rationalists in the Ambedkarite tradition. To be sure, they are not Dalit Panthers. Azad, despite the fact that he calls his group an army, spends most of his efforts on ensuring education for Dalit children. Mevani works to ensure land officially belonging to Dalits is returned to them. Both are constitutional leaders, believers in the rule of law, anti-violence and careful to defuse any situation that has the potential to turn violent. Despite widespread claims that both either incite or actually preach violence they have been against stoking of conflict between Dalits and Muslims or retaliatory actions against upper caste violence. It is symptomatic of our times that despite this, both are seen as terrifying threats to the Indian state, the media and the right wing middle and upper castes and classes in India - all of which amount to the same thing really.  chief Azad is in jail under a battery of false cases since June 2017. More recently the UP government has   under the National Security Act, an absurd law to invoke in his case. Mevani is constantly attacked in the media, especially since he joined electoral politics and won a seat in Vadgam, Gujarat. Recently he came under fire for refusing to entertain Republic TV in Chennai and for offering a critical appraisal of BR Ambedkar which was predictably and deliberately taken out of context. Why are the two such threats despite being no more than militant liberals? Part of the answer lies in the fact that they have an Ambedkarite pride in their Dalit identity and are very clear that it is their right and duty not to be quiet in the face of caste-based abuse and exploitation. In the feudal state of Uttar Pradesh, Azad and Mevani have emerged as a formidable challenge at a time the threat posed by the   lost both substance and direction. The BJP therefore considers it important to quash them and their politics at all costs. In the deeply communal Gujarat, the mobilisation of Dalits and Muslims by a dynamic leader can spell doom for the dominant BJP. The recent elections and Mevani's thumping victory was a taste of that destabilising effect for the dominant party. Both men are also articulate and not fooled by any of the smokescreen discourses of the dominant party. If Mevani is the more urbane and suave of the two, Azad has a clarity born from being grounded in his location and a compassion that gives his home-grown north Indian machismo an unusual edge. This is why both are an anathema to the mostly inarticulate, unintelligent leaders of the dominant, or indeed, any party. Both men came to prominence over democratic contestations of violence against Dalits. In Mevani's case, it was the atrocity in Una; in Azad's case the atrocity in Shabbirpur. This is really at the heart of the hatred, fear and resentment directed against the two. They are not going to remain silent about atrocities against Dalits and their responses to it are not reactive but proactive, collective and systematic. Mevani has openly spoken in support of Azad, particularly after his arrest. The combination of the two men is more frightening than taking on them individually. Mevani has the theoretical tools and a critical engagement with history, Ambedkarite and otherwise. His speech taken out of the context by the media recently shows that he is neither hagiographic about Ambedkar nor his Communist heroes and knows that historical circumstances have changed and so must theories, even as his primary commitment to their vision remains. Azad has a hands-on engagement with the community which forms the foundation of his politics but his vision is resolutely and uncritically Ambedkarite. Both have much to offer each other and what is important is that both are cognisant of the need to combine theoretical vision and grassroots politics. Mevani sees himself as a social movement activist; Azad sees himself as putting Ambedkarite thinking into action. Both have much to say to each other. But with a hostile state, media and middle class combine, things are not easy for them. The internet Ambedkarites are mostly silent about them, when not critical of them. That is the privilege of internet activists. They do not have to get their hands dirty. It is important for us to nurture these two young men. They are by no means perfect but they are the best we have. On gender, their thinking has not gone very far. On the issue of politics of sexuality, they have not thought much. Neither of them is in touch with his subconscious - both deal mainly with the rational and the legal/constitutional - but it is our duty to widen the scope of their vision. In the mindlessly neoliberal, rabidly anti-intellectual and activism-phobic times we live in, they are reminders that not all is lost. Not fooled by hyper nationalism, grounded in local struggles and unafraid to stand up for who they are, Chandrashekhar Azad and Jignesh Mevani might well be the reasons for us to start thinking again. That they are both really handsome and hot is just an added bonus.","title":"Why everyone feels threatened by Jignesh Mevani and Chandrashekhar Azad","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrashekhar-azad-jignesh-mevani-dalit-politics-vadgam-gujarat-bhim-army-br-ambedkar/story/1/22046.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15295},{"author":"Ashok Upadhyay","content":"Speaking at the 70th foundation day of the  (NCC), prime minister Narendra Modi said no one would be spared in his drive against corruption. Seeking cooperation of the youth in the battle against corruption and black money, the PM said, “I don’t think any youth of my country is now willing to tolerate corruption. The hate for corruption in the society is visible… I want you to help end corruption that is like a termite.\" Countering the general perception that the rich and the powerful mostly get away while the poor get the short shrift in corruption cases, the PM said, “The country used to discuss corruption in despair, the lament being 'no one catches the powerful'. Three former chief ministers are now rotting in jail. Who says there is no justice? No one will be spared.\" The prime minister was talking about the three former chief ministers who are currently in jail. While former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra have been convicted and sentenced in cases related to the fodder scam, former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala is serving a jail term following conviction in a recruitment scam. Three former chief ministers landing in jail on graft charges is certainly unprecedented in seven decades of independent India as far as corruption is concerned. It is also not the norm in a country where the general perception is that the powerful political class is never punished, and are above the law. But going by how the prime minister placed the issue in his speech, it may seem like it was his government which ensured the conviction of these powerful people. But is that truly the case? Let us first talk about the fodder scam cases. In March 1996, the CBI was brought into the case as per the Supreme Court’s order. Lalu Yadav was named as accused in six cases.  The central investigation agency filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused in 1997.  On 30 September 2013, a special CBI court in Ranchi convicted former Lalu Prasad Yadav and Jagannath Mishra along with 44 others in the case. The court had announced a sentence of five years for Lalu Yadav and four years for Jagannath Mishra. On January 6, Lalu Yadav was again convicted in another fodder scam case and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. On January 24, a special CBI court in Ranchi awarded five years jail to Lalu Yadav and Jagannath Mishra, this being the third case in which verdict has been pronounced. Barring orders by the courts in the last two cases, nothing has happened after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister of India. So his or his government’s role is certainly not a factor in sending Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra to jail. In the teacher’s recruitment scam case, in which former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala has been convicted, started in 2003. The Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe. In June 2008, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the court of special CBI judge against 62 people including OP Chautala. In January 2013, the court convicted Chautala and sent him to jail for 10 years. So Om Prakash Chautala was already in jail by the time Modi became the prime minister. It is very clear from the facts that in none of the three court cases involving the three former chief ministers did Modi or his government has a role to play. So while decrying corruption, the PM forgot to clarify that the credit for putting these powerful politicians behind bars was not his for the taking.  Is this not a form of moral corruption, or did the PM not realise what he was implying?","title":"Modi may be hitting corruption hard, but what has jail for 3 former CMs to do with him?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/corruption-bjp-modi-black-money-fodder-scam-lalu-yadav-jagannath-mishra-op-chautala/story/1/22062.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15296},{"author":"Harsh Mander","content":"Our second day of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018 was India’s 67th Republic Day. We spent this day travelling in remote rural Bengal, meeting families of three young men who were lynched, and their bodies mutilated and dismembered. This was one more lynching in the country that was celebrated by videotaping the killing and circulating the recording triumphantly on social media. It was claimed at that time, by the crowds, the police and even representatives of the ruling party, that a mob of villagers killed them because they were cow thieves. The story we heard in our travels was all too familiar, one troublingly similar to those that we have heard over and over again in the eight states to which the Karwan has travelled so far. It was the evening of the 27th roza fast of Ramazan in Eid on   midsummer last year. Three friends in three different villages in the North Bengal district of Uttar Dinajpur were enjoying the special Iftar meal to break their fasts with their families, in anticipation of the Eid celebrations that were to follow. The friends were all in their mid-twenties. Two were day labourers ready to do any work that was locally offered to them – construction work, farm labour, tea leaf plucking, and whatever else came their way; one was trying to set up a small business. All the three friends were married, with small children. Each of their families reported to us that their mobile phones rang while they were eating. Each said that the young men initially said to whoever called that they were reluctant to leave their family celebrations but finally conceded. They speculate that because the three of them often took petty construction assignments together, perhaps this was what they were called away so urgently for. But they now have no way of knowing for sure. Two of the young men left on their bikes, one walked and was picked up some distance away. They did not return that night. The next morning, each of the families was summoned to the police station. To collect their sons’ savaged bodies, dead and mutilated after mob lynching. The first family we met was in the village Dhulagoch. The young man Nasruddin’s ageing father, Yasin Mohammed, with a white beard, white singlet and blue lungi customary for men of his age, met us weeping. For the hour that we were with him, he would not leave my hand. He was joined by his mother, bent over with age and mourning, the boy’s mother, his widow Anisa and their two small children. The entire family sobbed out loud and long as they shared with us the trauma of his loss six months earlier, and the nightmare of what followed. He used to work in Delhi as a truck driver. After a road accident, his father called him back home. It did not matter if he earned less as work was uncertain and low-paid. At least he was safe and close to home. The morning after he did not return home, a policeman of the village came to their home in civil clothes. He showed them a video of a lynching. To their horror, they could recognise that one of the young men being attacked was Nasruddin. They rushed to the police station, only to be handed his bloodied and defaced dead body. The distraught families of his two friends were also there. We met their families as well in the course of our journey today. Nasirul’s mother Masida Begum and wife Marjina in the village Kutipada; and Samiruddin’s widow in the village Kandapora. Nasirul’s widow gave birth to a daughter months after he had died. Two of the bodies of the young men were lying in an ambulance, and a third on a hospital stretcher. They were disfigured and dismembered, with limbs smashed and crushed, and even their genitals stoned. The police would tell them nothing more than that villagers of a neighbouring Hindu village Durgapur had found them stealing cows. They had caught and in their mass fury lynched them. The families were enraged at the charge of their boys being cow thieves. \"Would anyone in their right mind set out to steal cows on motor cycles?\" they asked indignantly. But they reported that the police was rough with them. Two of the post-mortems were completed before the families arrived. One was done with the family present. The police then handed over the bodies to the families. The dazed and grieving families spent their own money to transport the bodies to their home before they confined each to their graves. After their deaths, some local politicians came to see them, and some people from the local media. A local politician announced that he was convinced that the men were indeed cow smugglers, without offering any proof. No senior officials, to offer help or solace. One family reported that the local block office gave them some grain and a bag of rice. Nothing else. We found the families in extreme want, with their able-bodied bread earners suddenly lost. The families were desperate to know the truth of who had killed their sons and husbands so viciously, and why. We looked at the papers of the cases, and found that the police had registered cases under Section 304, of culpable homicide not amounting to murder; and not murder under Section 302.  The faces of the killers and a large crowd of onlookers were clearly visible in the video they circulated. But only three men were ultimately arrested, and released on bail in just a fortnight because of the lenient sections of the Indian Penal Code under which they had been charged. The families went in delegations to the police station, but report that they were roughly tuned away without answers. They claim that the police threatened that they too would be locked up if they made too much trouble. The villages planned a gherao surrounding the police station. But a local representative of the panchayat – the same who said the men were cow smugglers - dissuaded them. He said that if they did this, it would anger their Hindu neighbours, and might result in Hindu-Muslim riots. It was wise, their representative advised them, to remain silent to avoid trouble in which in the end only they would suffer. They finally accepted this counsel – whether out of voluntary restraint, or despair. We decided that we should try to get some answers from the police to the grieving families. We took representatives from each of the three families with us to the Chopra Police Station. We waited for an hour before the circle inspector agreed to see us. We told him about the Karwan, and our concerns for the families whose sons had been lynched, that they were entitled to know the progress in the investigations into the lynching. I also asked if charges of murder had at least now been instituted against the killers. He said he would not speak to us until he had the permission of the district superintendent of police. He spoke to his superior in our presence and then replied that he was not authorised to give us any answers at all. I asked heatedly how as a public servant, he could turn away the families of the bereaved families. But he was adamant. We left Bengal intensely troubled about how deep the poison of communal hatred has penetrated even a part of India that has maintained greater communal peace after Partition than most others. The villagers in all the three villages to which we travelled said that apart from stray and minor incidents, there had before this been no major incidents of communal tension and violence between Hindus and Muslims of the area before this. All of this lies shattered after the lynching of the three young men, aggravated first by the charge that they were cow thieves, and then the refusal of the state administration to extend to them solace, support or justice of any kind. This is a failure also that I feel compelled to point to, of local civil liberty groups and progressive and secular political parties. My greatest disappointment was to observe that the attitude of the state administration to the victim families whose loved ones had been felled by hate violence was no different from that of the administrations of BJP ruled states. I could easily instead have been in Gujarat, or Rajasthan, or Uttar Pradesh, and not West Bengal. The betrayal of governments of political parties that claim to be secular in failing to defend their minorities rankles painfully and erodes the secular promises of India’s constitution. Today’s was a journey made even more painful because we made it on the day that the Indian government was celebrating its republic with displays of its military might and cultural pageantry. The despair and fear in the eyes of the members of the three families we met on this day in Bengal villages revealed how hollowed out are the promises of India’s republic to its most vulnerable citizens, and how weakly we all defend these.","title":"Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018: Lynchings expose the hollowed out promises of India’s republic","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karwan-e-mohabbat-lynchings-hate-crimes-bengal-bjp-congress/story/1/22013.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15297},{"author":"Kartik Mittal","content":"Last year, the powerful Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly announced a diplomatic and economic blockade against another regional pseudo-ally – the state of  .

The involvement of the other regional GCC nations, including Bahrain, Egypt and UAE in the blockade further complicated the position to negotiate, as the quartet had a unified and unwavering stance in dedicating the terms for appeasement. The countries cited Qatar's alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for their action, insisting that Qatar has violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the GCC. The GCC also felt threatened by the media arm of Qatar - Al Jazeera - for engaging in what they termed as a \"media conspiracy\" against the nations, and also for the country’s proximity with Iran. Now entering its eight month, the blockade by the GCC nations effectively amounts to economic sanctions on Qatar, which has rendered  , travel, trade and diplomatic restrictions. The effect of these sanctions has been widespread, crippling several companies operating out of the country, and including its citizens and expatriates. The abrupt notice and enforcement of the sanctions had also meant the country was put in a limbo, freezing several of its regional assets and disrupting everyday operations.   As a small gas-rich nation, Qatar has been balancing its trade with heavy dependence on its oil and gas exports for subsidising its food and industrial imports. With its land border with Saudi Arabia closed, Qatar’s food imports initially dropped substantially, before recovering via expensive alternatives. While the allegations against Qatar’s supposed terror-funding has been the prime focal point, in reality, it is also an extension of the regional differences, especially manifested after the network’s coverage since the 2011 Arab Spring. Al Jazeera, the state-funded broadcaster in Doha, was one of the significant nerve-points in the diplomatic blockade, as the GCC members have over the past continued to express distrust over the network’s coverage of the Arab Spring and for “negatively portraying” the local governments. In fact, the complete shutdown of Al Jazeera was one of the terms put forward jointly by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to even commence negotiations. The direct losses incurred by Qatar, along with the indirect losses, would amount to several billion dollars, and the country is already exploring legal avenues to claim compensation from the GCC countries. Several senior ministers have also indicated that Qatar has contracted a specialised legal team to study the actions taken by the blockading countries against it. The country has also been clear in its position on backing Al Jazeera, effectively ruling out any calls for its shutdown.  While the blockade imposed by the GCC is geo-political, efforts by the members in calling for a wider global support, including from the UN is far-fetched. The issue was momentarily complicated when US President Donald Trump took credit for the Saudi-led actions (which was initiated shortly after his visit to the region), but nevertheless it did not gain any traction as international consensus, including from the European Union and the United Nations, among other nations, had called for the resolution of the diplomatic crisis through dialogue. The gas-rich nation has virtually been cornered over its movements - both financially (for its current instruments/investments in the GCC countries) and physically, having to re-rout its land and sea movements via Iran.     Surprisingly, despite all the extreme measures by the GCC quartet to arm-wrestle Qatar, countries, including the UAE and Oman, continue to depend on Qatar’s gas pipeline to power their infrastructure. Qatar continues to pump around two billion cubic feet of gas per day to the UAE, showing no signs of impact from the sanctions.","title":"US-GCC sanctions: One year on, how Qatar is weathering the crisis","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/qatar-blockade-gcc-saudi-us-al-jazeera-donald-trump-arab-spring/story/1/22006.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15298},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"In the most anticipated speech of the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, the last hurrah as it were, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, outlined his idea of America at the globalist platform, asserting that the two are not at odds with each other. Declaring that \"America First\" - the motto of his nationalist government under the Republican party banner - isn't an automatic route to \"America alone\", Trump dispelled some of the widely held fears that he would hijack WEF's overtly internationalist outlook with his nationalist zeal, upsetting the applecart somewhat.   Instead of railing against the transnational order, Trump trained guns at \"predatory trading practices\", saying each country has the right to safeguard its interests. Hinting at the wide-scale off shoring of jobs and manufacturing by American companies over cheap labour and cost, Trump said he has cut corporate taxes to make America \"open for business\" again, something that wasn't being done since the time of Ronald Reagan, Trump's Republican antecedent.  While the tax cuts are being hotly debated in the US national media, concurrent with other policies of the Trump-led White House, such as depleting medical cover for the poor and the middle classes, immigration tightening and strict regulation of previously lenient visa norms such as the H-1B, etc, the US president waxed eloquent about the stock market boom that has followed since the cuts were announced. Trump also spoke of America being a great investment destination, hard-selling his country against a resurgent Europe under the twin leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump also pitched America as an alternative to obvious Asian markets such as India and China. In fact, parts of Trump's speech sounded similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's keynote address at the opening plenary session on January 23, especially the well-oiled business-friendly pitch. While PM Modi had warned against \"protectionism\", Trump sounded a caveat, saying every country has the right to defend itself economically. However, unlike PM Modi, Trump made no reference to climate change, given his high-profile exit from the Paris climate deal in April last year. He touched upon securing America more in terms of defence spendings, as well as saying that the anti-ISIS coalition has wrested almost 100 per cent of the territories once occupied by the Islamic State.  \r\n \r\n President Trump sounded more sober than his usual bombast, though the claims that he made on employment rates among Hispanics, African-Americans and women can be attributed to the policies of the previous Obama administration with its strong affirmative action push. Similarly, the state of the political economy could be gauged from the fact that on the first anniversary of Trump's swearing-in, there was a US government shutdown because the Congress couldn't agree on a federal budget. Not to mention the bad press that Trump is still getting nationally, with some seriously considering if he can be impeached. That said, the expected grouse against \"fake news\" and \"nasty\" media at a global platform was new for the WEF, even though Trump enjoyed a full house, like always. Trump's speech and later interaction with WEF head Klaus Schwab indicate clearly that his anti-immigration policies will continue unabated, making it increasingly difficult for foreign policy experts in India to negotiate a better deal for the expats and NRIs, increasingly courted back home by all political parties. Does Trump's speech ring alarm bells already? Yes, but they are not as loud as we had made them out to be. ","title":"'America First' doesn't mean 'America Alone': What Trump said at World Economic Forum","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/donald-trump-davos-world-economic-forum-2018-united-states-of-america/story/1/22009.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15299},{"author":"Amna Mirza","content":"Diplomatic relations with China have always been a thorny issue as far as India's global outreach programmes are concerned, especially in its efforts to reach out to neighbouring countries. At a time when the US, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has been hinting at  , China is trying to take centre stage with its globalisation plans. To understand how this Chinese stance impacts Indian interests, one must look at Beijing's engagement with neighbouring countries. It's an open secret that China is Pakistan's all-weather ally. However, of late, Beijing has been offering submarines to countries along the Indian Ocean coastlines at lucrative prices. Pakistan and China recently announced they will hold joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean regularly. Reports have also surfaced saying China's third domestic aircraft carrier is   in the Indian Ocean. It is pretty evident that Pakistan has consented to self-destruction by agreeing to be a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and trying to bypass the US' strategic encirclement policy that has a military base in Diego Garcia in Indian Ocean and includes the South China Sea. With Pakistan getting loans at exorbitantly high interest rates, imperialist loot and plunder is pretty evident. China has been pretty ruthless in this game of trying to shift the power balance in its own favour. China has invested several billion dollars in building sea lines of communication through Pakistan running far into the Indian Ocean. This is a difficult target to pursue, but that hasn't deterred China from actually going for it. China was critical of the US moving its   in the South China sea, calling it a violation of its sovereignty, and pledged to take necessary measures to protect the same. Beijing took this stand despite the fact that its ships and submarines keep surfacing near Japanese islands, near Taiwan and in the Indian Ocean. China's clout is not restricted to Pakistan, it is growing in the entire Asian region. The country's role in fomenting trouble in Maldives is well-known. Exiled Maldivian Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed termed Chinese property deals in Maldives as \"land grab\". Chinese influence actually stretches to as far as Australia. It is being said that Beijing's rising display of might in South Asia is in response to India's outings in Southeast Asia. It is indeed great that India can work closely with other nations which are joined by the common thread of Chinese aggression in the region. New Delhi can especially draw support from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Even though India has been mindful of the Chinese threat, it needs to shore up greater support given that the challenge from Beijing is growing increasingly formidable.","title":"India must forge deeper ties with ASEAN nations to counter China in Indian Ocean","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chinese-aggression-donald-trump-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-cpec-maldives-pakistan/story/1/21980.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15300},{"author":"Kaveree Bamzai","content":"That the right wing in India has no sense of history is being proven daily on the streets of cities across India as Karni Sena and its clones threaten the screening of  . They want to ban a movie they have not seen. And they want to protest the depiction of their clan though they do not know details of how it is portrayed. This is in keeping with their lack of knowledge of history. Or rather, as Audrey Truschke points out in an earlier  for  , the skewed colonial history that was taught to us all. As she notes: \"The story of how Aurangzeb became India’s most maligned king begins in the British colonial period. In brief, the British wanted to point to Indian rulers who were even worse than themselves in order to justify the horrors of colonialism. So they painted a skewed picture of Aurangzeb, often misrepresenting his alleged worst crimes. Many Hindu nationalists today think that hating Aurangzeb is a distinctively Indian feeling, but such sentiments are perhaps more aptly described as a colonial inheritance.\" For the right wing, Aurangzeb is seen as the epitome of everything evil. Not only do they see him as a destroyer of temples (though he built more temples than he destroyed), but also as the man who imposed the dreaded jizya tax and disliked music and art. In asking for the boycott of  , the RSS has shown that it is no less than Aurangzeb - they hate the very thing he is said to have abhorred. So, do we become what we hate most? It would seem so. No matter that Aurangzeb's name is sought to be erased by the BJP from Indian history (though he ruled quite successfully for almost half a century) and that no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his name when he spoke disparagingly of Rahul Gandhi recently, he has become the epitome of what a \"bad Muslim\" can be. So, if we are to believe the history that has been taught to us, and is now forwarded through WhatsApps, we should assume the RSS and Karni Sena are Aurangzeb's true heirs. That is also not quite true though - music wasn’t proscribed even in Aurangzeb’s court. The emperor’s own coronation anniversaries were marked by both musicians and dancers. Not only that, his patronisation of music meant that a number of dhrupads were composed in his name. In the  , Bahktawar Khan wrote of the Emperor having a “perfect expert's knowledge” of music. In  , Alauddin Khilji is shown as feeding those pages of history to fire that don't bear his name. If history were to be rewritten to suit those in power, we would have as many versions of it as we have had rulers. Will burning buses and protesting at cinema halls change Rajput history? The irony is that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a film that celebrates every virtue the Rajputs hold dear - including a very emotive sequence at the end when Rani Padmavati leads her army of women into the flames, choosing jauhar over falling into the arms of Khilji. Every community has its own idea of its special status. The Rajputs certainly are entitled to it - and, in fact, the movie celebrates that, with Ratan Singh saying \" ,   Rajput;   Rajput;   Rajput.\" If their objection is that the film portrays a sort of \"love jihad\", they couldn't be more wrong. Arjun Appadurai speaks of the \"fear of small numbers\", the idea that a small minority is standing in the way of a great people from fully embracing their nationalism. It is exactly what is happening here. Khilji's existence is supposed to stand in the way of Rajput's embracing their idea of who they are, or ought to be. Now if that is not a majoritarian mindset, what is? How does it make the Karni Sena or RSS any different from what they imagine Aurangzeb to have been?","title":"How are Rajput Karni Sena and RSS any different from what they imagine Aurangzeb to be?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karni-sena-violence-rss-padmaavat-aurangzeb-right-wing-vandalism-gurgaon-school-bus/story/1/21976.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15301},{"author":"Siddharth Singh","content":"The   has released the US National Defence Strategy last week, shifting its focus, for the first time in over a decade, from fighting terror to preparing for what it believes is a threat from  and  . The National Defence Strategy (NDS) is an important document which encapsulates the Trump administration’s defence policies in one place for the first time. The NDS bluntly describes a US military that is losing its edge over potential competitors, and urges “increased and sustained investment” for “long-term strategic competitions specifically with China and Russia”. The NDS also identifies three theatres of engagement for the US: the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the West Asia that is consistent with what the Obama administration had been doing towards the end. While the NDS specifically points out that “China is a strategic competitor which is using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours while militarising features in the South China Sea”, the document blames Russia of violating the borders of nearby nations and pursuing veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbours. The unclassified synopsis of NDS 2018 acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment, characterised by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations. The NDS states in clear terms about growing Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and states on China \"continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to pursue a military modernization programme that seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future”. The Trump administration had also released its first National Security Strategy (NSS) last month on December 18, 2017. In principle, the strategy which has been outlined in the NSS document charts out the strategic objectives of Trump’s administration and also the ways to meet those strategic aims. The NSS document describes the Indo-Pacific region as the most populous and economically dynamic part of the world and maps it as a stretch from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States and reinforces its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance with international law in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS reflects a growing consensus in the US that China is an adversary. The document is a frank acknowledgment of widely shared concerns about China’s rise. It is important here to note that the approach of Trump administration is a far cry from the Obama administration’s 2015 NSS which had welcomed the rise of a “peaceful” and “prosperous” China. In future, a sharp deterioration of China-US ties cannot be ruled out, especially if Washington perceives Beijing as a hindrance when it comes to resolving the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. The Trump administration’s complaint of China’s bullying of other States using “economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats,” echoes fears spreading from Asia to Europe. In the Indo-Pacific region, as far as New Delhi is concerned, the NSS “welcomes India’s emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic and defence partner”. On the future course of action in the bilateral partnership between the US and India, the document mentions that the US will expand its defence and security cooperation with India which is a major defence partner of the United States, and will also support India’s growing relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific region. There is a specific mention in the document of the much-talked and debated “quadrilateral partnership” among the US, Japan, India and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region, and the NSS puts its stamp on it by mentioning the “Quad” for \"free and open Indo-Pacific\". On the issue of maritime cooperation, Washington has time and again shown its willingness to deepen its strategic partnership with New Delhi and support India’s leadership role in Indian Ocean security and throughout the broader region which is reflective in the cooperation in the Malabar naval exercise. Terrorism in South Asia is one of the biggest challenges among other geopolitical issues and in a direct reference to it, the NSS states that “the US will press Pakistan to intensify the counterterrorism efforts, since no partnership can survive a country’s support for militants and terrorists who target a partner’s own service members and officials”. Overall, the hypothesis of the NSS is based on the principle of realism in international relations as it defines the international system as one of great power competition in which the document specifically points out about Russia and China and portray them as “revisionist powers” challenging the status quo and identifies both the nations as strategic competitors or opponents of the United States. The NSS also criticises past several decades of US foreign policy approach and points out that in past it was shaped by the misguided belief that \"engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners\". This kind of realist framework in the conceptual context needs to be welcomed because it was long overdue departure from previous and successive administrations of the US. Interestingly, the NSS neither makes any mention of China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative nor mentions about the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together has the potential for a parallel Sino-centric sphere of influence in future. The US needs to shed its obsession with zero-sum trade reciprocity and should come out with a coherent and comprehensive geo-economics strategy if it wants to preserve the US-led rules-based order and counter China’s grand strategy to carve out a parallel Sino-centric order or sphere of influence.  ","title":"What Trump's new national defence and security strategies mean for India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/us-national-defence-strategy-security-india-us-ties-defence-trump-obama-administration/story/1/21979.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15302},{"author":"Minhaz Merchant","content":"The   between the chief justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and four Supreme Court collegium justices - J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph - gets curiouser by the day. Despite several meetings to reconcile their differences, the gulf between India’s seniormost justices has not narrowed. What precisely are those differences? At their press conference and in their seven-page letter, the four collegium justices were vague in their demands. For those who want linguistic clarity and brevity from our finest judicial minds, the letter gives little indication of either. Sample this: “ But if all Supreme Court justices are equals, why shouldn’t cases, sensitive or not, be assigned to benches led by “junior” Supreme Court judges? No clear answer has been forthcoming. So what do the four rebel justices really want? First, they want the case relating to the death of judge BH Loya reassigned. That wish has been fulfilled. Justice Arun Mishra was hearing the Loya case. Rattled by the events of last week, he recused himself. The CJI, in a show of authority, reassigned the case to a bench headed by himself. He was under relentless pressure to reassign the Loya case to a bench headed by one of the four collegium justices. He did not. Instead, he even transferred the two PILs related to the case pending in the Bombay High Court to his own bench. Last week, the petitioners’ senior counsel Dushyant Dave had pleaded “with folded hands” against the CJI doing that. The CJI brushed aside Dave’s plea. A group of lawyers and politicians are using the  , as they had earlier used the  , to target BJP president Amit Shah. The confrontation between the Maharashtra government’s counsel Harish Salve and Dave in the CJI’s court on January 22, brought this out into the open. Dave claimed that Salve had defended Shah in the past and should not appear in the Loya case due to conflict of interest. The charge was summarily rejected by the CJI’s three-judge bench.   Salve has, meanwhile, submitted medical documents and other material to the Supreme Court to show that judge Loya’s death occurred due to natural causes. The CJI has posted the next hearing in the case for February 2. But amid the judge Loya clamour, the case that lurks in the background is about building the  . Like Banquo’s ghost that haunted Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Ram temple case haunts the Supreme Court. The long drawn-out case is now with a bench headed by the CJI. He retires on October 2, 2018. There is an expectation that the CJI wants to deliver a verdict in the case before he demits office. The same powerful group of lawyers, activists, politicians and sections of the media that has shown exceptional interest in the judge Loya case fears that the CJI could be inclined to rule in favour of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque stood. Such a ruling would benefit the BJP in three big states due to go to the polls in December 2018: Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. All three states will feature binary BJP-Congress contests. All three face strong anti-incumbency. A pro-temple ruling would give the BJP a steroid boost ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.  Two outcomes can now be divined. First, a chastened CJI, buffeted by the collegium’s rebellion, will postpone a verdict on the Ram temple case till after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, citing its sensitivity. Second, the CJI could rule against  building the Ram temple where the Babri mosque stood and instead suggest the construction of two new structures, a temple and a mosque, side by side. That would suit the Opposition ahead of 2019. All of these well-laid plans though may amount to nothing. Even if the Supreme Court’s verdict goes against building the Ram temple, or the verdict is inordinately delayed, the anger that it will spark among devout Hindus will be electorally fissile. In the end, therefore, the elaborate shenanigans we have been witness to in the Supreme Court over the past two weeks could end in a whimper. But the spotlight it has shone on the apex court and its hallowed innards will have served a purpose.  Why, for example, haven’t the senior justices of the Supreme Court shown similar ire, as they have over assignment of cases, against the real issues that bedevil India’s judicial system: deep-seated corruption, shambolic infrastructure, a mounting backlog of cases, lawyers holding clients to ransom with adjournments, and the opaque collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court by other Supreme Court judges? Such opacity hardly inspires confidence in India’s top judicial minds as they wrestle with the fissure within their ranks and Banquo’s ghost that hovers silently over the unbuilt Ram temple in Ayodhya.","title":"Why Ram temple issue is lurking behind crisis in Supreme Court","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-judge-loya-ram-mandir-2019-modi-amit-shah-congress/story/1/21953.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15303},{"author":"Aruna Chandrasekhar","content":"Given the surreal times that we live in, it's always reassuring to hear world leaders reaffirm that climate change is still real for them. This time it was   at Davos, acknowledging climate change as one of the biggest threats to the world as we know it.  It was a statement in keeping with India's strong positioning as a climate leader and doing more than it should. But that we are bending over backwards to set ambitious climate goals - given our history as being a site of colonial pillage - is a point I wish he drove home without constantly having to bring yoga into it.  Sustainable lifestyles make for great soft power sell at Davos, but not when you are the world's second-largest coal consumer and third-largest emitter, with a capital that's not particularly conducive to \"pranayama\".

I wish he'd spoken of the impacts closer home -  , caught off guard by  , agrararian suicides in a year where average rainfall dropped five per cent and devastating floods that took over a thousand lives in the sub-continent.

Over 200 coal projects - many of them greenfield - still lie on the top of his office's  . It was only because of a case filed by air pollution activist Sunil Dahiya that    have been put on hold, unless they comply with new emission norms. Dahiya is a campaigner with Greenpeace, an organisation the present government has relentlessly persecuted for calling out the excesses of coal culture. Modi's call for rich nations to do their bit and arguments against protectionism struck the right notes, as developed countries must demonstrate they can put their money where their mouth is, beginning with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol which turned 20 last year. India deserves, and is due to all, the finance and technology in helping it fulfil its most daring gigwatt goals, and to build climate adaptation capacity. But this must be finance that is easy to access. To win a project under  , for instance, is nearly impossible, making one wonder what Make In India the government is hoping to seed fund from its unique carbon tax. While the international press saw Modi's protectionism diatribe as directly   America-centricism - the latest being a 30 per cent tariff imposed on foreign-made solar cells and modules - the Indian government is currently mulling imposing one, putting Operation Suryanamaskar's success in peril. For Modi to invoke Mahatma Gandhi's spin on natural resources while making an elevator pitch at Davos was a stretch even by his standards. For one, his government's continued expansion of Coal India's mines towards a 1.5 billion target has been the opposite of the kid-glove-meets-swadeshi kind of trusteeship,   to forcibly grab indigenous land, while  that allow for local trustees to have any say in the matter. Two, his government's coal auction regime has not been a vast improvement, with ghosts of cartelisation returning, conflicts around land and pollution that were never   and mines unable to get off the ground. Instead, contract mining has become the default way to go, with the state taking on the bidding and regulatory prep work, while private miners like the   rake in the profits without the exposure. By the looks of it, neither   nor   have benefitted the least from three and a half years of Modi's custodianship. If Modi really wants Davos and the world to believe in India taking the lead on climate change, he needs to shed his telling proximity to the fossil fuel industry, acknowledge and fix the haze at home, announce the no-go zones in India's forests and wetland buffers, strengthen laws that empower communities with the lowest carbon footprint and make clean energy R&D accessible, without doing away with essential laws and protections.  All else is \"pawanmuktasana\" for the international press.","title":"Why Prime Minister Modi's talk of climate change in Davos was hogwash","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/davos-pm-modi-climate-yoga-change-pollution-trump-indias-coal-culture-clean-energy/story/1/21948.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15304},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"Uddhav Thackeray was searching for a “villain” he could blame for the Shiv Sena’s decision to go solo in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He found one in the form of BJP national president Amit Shah. Thackeray claims that Shah sidelined the other constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) while setting a target of 380 seats for the next Lok Sabha election. “Why the astonishment over Shiv Sena’s stand to go solo in the elections?” Thackeray asked in party mouthpiece   on January 24. Thackeray compares the Shiv Sena with the army of Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji: “The Maratha warrior didn’t worry about the vast empires of the Muslim rulers, their unlimited sources of wealth even though he himself didn’t have enough money to pay his army men.” However, it seems he has not taken lessons from Shivaji’s guerrilla war tactics. True to his impulsive nature, Thackeray has revealed his strategy much before the country can go into the election mode. He has given the BJP ample time to formulate its strategy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election without his party’s support. Interestingly, it was the BJP that had kept Thackeray in the dark about the future of their alliance when the former had unilaterally announced a break up two days before the nomination for Assembly polls began in September 2014. “A mature leader never lets his rivals know his strategy much in advance. Uddhavji should have waited for some time,” says a Shiv Sena leader. Voters will not trust Thackeray’s intention to take on the BJP until he proves his credibility by quitting the coalition government. His criticism regarding the government’s failure on issues like loan waiver to farmers will not carry weight till he remains a key player of the government. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have begun chiding him for sticking to power rather than dismantling the alliance. Traditionally, the Thackerays are not known to be open-hearted. Shiv Sena workers are not sure whether they will get monetary support from the party for their work during elections. Around six months ago, the Shiv Sena had fielded Tanaji Sawant, a wealthy Mumbai-based businessman, in the Legislative Council elections from the faraway Yavatmal constituency, declining loyal but poor workers the opportunity to contest polls. Sawant secured a comfortable victory that upset party loyalists. Bring this into the equation, and it is highly possible Thackeray will choose candidates with money instead of those who have been toiling for the party for many years. Ordinary Shiv Sena workers have gone into political hibernation since Thackeray joined the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in December 2014. The chief does not have any programme to infuse enthusiasm into them. The moment any Shiv Sena worker expresses his dissent over the functioning of the government, a patent question is thrown at him: why is he complaining if he is a part of the government? The Shiv Sainiks have been caught in a Catch-22 situation. They feel they are in the government but the BJP has ensured that they do not get any benefit of the power. Thackeray will have to come up with a detailed roadmap to revive the party — at present, he does not have any. Thackeray has announced that Shiv Sena will contest elections in every state on the Hindutva plank. The ground reality, however, paints no rosy picture. In Maharashtra, north Indians and Gujaratis will vote for the BJP on the Hindutva plank as the Shiv Sena has time and again taken a hard stand against these communities. For north Indians, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is a bigger Hindutva icon than Thackeray. The Gujaratis do not consider anyone Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s equal — he remains the biggest Hindutva idol. The Marathi-speaking voters, on the other hand, will rally behind the Shiv Sena as they are divided in other parties — BJP, Congress and the NCP. It is important to note that Hindutva supporters disapprove of Thackeray’s growing closeness with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee whom they consider anti-Hindutva owing to her politics of appeasement. The Shiv Sena is not a dominant force outside the Konkan and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra. In Mumbai, it will have a close contest with the BJP should the two parties fight the polls separately. Thackeray has failed to take Shiv Sena to new heights in western Maharashtra, north Maharashtra and Vidarbha, the regions where half of the Assembly seats are consolidated. Uddhav’s decision to go solo in the election is certainly aimed at energising depressed Shiv Sena workers, but it will not get him sweeping power. Who will he blame then?","title":"Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to go without BJP in 2019 general elections will be disastrous","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uddhav-thackeray-shiv-sena-lok-sabha-elections-2019-maharashtra/story/1/21949.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15305},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"The   could well be mistaken for the latest season of \"MasterChef Karnataka\".

The Congress hit back with a video that spoke of how Yogi is a recipe that the BJP has prepared to stir trouble in Karnataka. The video made references to the criminal cases against Yogi and the BJP was not amused. Plagiarism is the name of the game so a week later, the BJP too chose the same culinary metaphor to show Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao as chefs, out to prepare beef biryani. The ingredients in this case, according to the makers of the video, included \"illegal beef from a slaughterhouse\", \"rotten rice\" given as part of the PDS, the inability to solve the Cauvery and Mahadayi river water sharing crisis, killings of Hindu youths and alleged corruption in the building of a steel flyover in Bengaluru. But the real reason behind calling it \"beef biryani\" was to stress the appeasement of the minorities under Siddaramaiah. On Monday, the Congress beefed up its rhetoric by expanding the BJP to \"Beef Janata Party\", inspired from Gabbar Singh Tax, perhaps. The attempt was to expose the hypocrisy of the BJP which adopts different positions on consumption of beef in different states. For example, while it does not breathe a word about its anti-beef position in a beef-consuming Meghalaya that goes to polls next month, it wants to put the Congress on the mat in Karnataka by making it a poll issue. The video also spoke of Goa that under BJP's Manohar Parrikar wants to import beef and UP's BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who reportedly runs a meat processing unit. The reason for the BJP raising the decibel levels over its love for the cow goes back five years, when the party was in power in Karnataka. In 2010, the then BJP government had passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill. Siddaramaiah, then in the Opposition had dramatically torn a copy of the Bill, accusing Yeddyurappa of behaving like \"Hitler's regime\" and \"imposing a vegetarian\" culture on the people of Karnataka. His argument was that by banning beef, mutton would become prohibitive. Three years later, when Siddaramaiah became CM, one of his first decisions was to overturn the beef ban. The 1964 Cattle Preservation Act was restored under which slaughter of cows, calves and buffaloes was banned. The Yeddyurappa Bill had banned the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and imposed harsh punishments for violators of the law. By making beef a poll issue, the BJP wants to jog the memory of voters on Siddaramaiah's conduct, hoping to sway the vegetarian Kannadiga and the orthodox Hindu on to its side. This is because even while standing his ground on his right to decide what food will be on his plate, Siddaramaiah has emphasised that he is  . \"There is both Siddha and Rama in my name,'' he declared, raising the spectre of a Gujarat-like temple run in Karnataka by the Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. The Congress, having seen the results of running a Hindu-ised Gujarat campaign, wants to ensure the BJP does not pitch its tent as the sole spokesperson of the Hindus in Karnataka. The BJP's assessment is that controversial planks like beef ban will find traction in pockets of Karnataka, especially the communally sensitive coastal belt. The intention also is to provoke the Muslim voices in the Congress to speak up, so that it will give the BJP a chance to label the ruling party as batting solely for the minorities. So far, the Congress has ensured it does not fall into the trap, trying instead to pick holes in the BJP's policy of different strokes in different states. But what is certain is that the beef recipe will only bring a divisive election on the menu and that won't do Karnataka any good.","title":"BJP vs Congress: Who will get the beef recipe right in Karnataka polls?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-siddaramaiah-yogi-adityanath-beef-ban-bjp-congress/story/1/21918.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15306},{"author":"Valay Singh Rai","content":"At a dimly lit internet cafe in one of the several urban villages of Delhi, two Class 12 students, sporting latest hairstyles and faux designer labels, are getting their school projects printed. Sushant’s submission is on the Goods and Services Tax (GST); his friend Sumit struggles to translate his project title into English. The irritable cafe owner is in a hurry to move on to his other customers. “Write the title in Hindi -   (the crisis of unemployment),” Sumit tells him.  The boys study in a government school in south Delhi’s Swamy Nagar, a posh neighbourhood that houses many of the 1 per cent Indians who have come to acquire 73 per cent of the wealth generation in India in 2017. The boys on the other hand belong to the 14-18 years age group that constitute 11 per cent (100.2 million) of India’s population of 1.2 billion people. They form a huge chunk of our much-touted (and neglected) demographic dividend of 390 million millennials and the 12 million young people who join the workforce every year. A week ago, the   (ASER) was released by Pratham. Titled \"Beyond Basics\", the latest report is a welcome departure from the past as it looks at rural youth in 14-18 age group, through the lenses of - activity, ability, awareness, and aspirations. Earlier, ASER reports have brought out in stark detail the poor learning levels of children in the schooling system. It is thanks to this annual survey, we now know that while school enrolment has gone up to more than 95 per cent, learning levels of children in government schools are woeful. Most Class 3 students are unable to Class 2-level text. The findings of \" \" are a stinging slap to policymakers and state governments of the 24 states that formed part of the    The worst indictment is for the union government, which has been stubbornly resisting the extension of the Right to Education Act from 14 years to 18 years.  So far, only primary school education in India is a legal right, which is why primary school enrolments have shot up to more than 90 per cent. Groups like the   have been demanding that secondary school education should also be made a legal right as most children tend to \"drop out\" after Class 8. The latest survey confirms once again that the urgent need is to make the entire 12 years of schooling a legal right. The survey has thrown up worrisome trends that belie the media frenzy over Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India, and Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat. Consider this: Out of 100 children in Class 7 only half of them continue to study till Class 10. And only 25 per cent of them go on to complete Class 12. Less than 10 per cent of the youth surveyed in the \"Beyond Basics\" report were enrolled in undergraduate or other degree courses. Nearly 30 per cent of all youth are not enrolled in either a school or any other educational course. The prime minister, who is in   to tell the world’s business tycoons that \"India means business\" ought to bear in mind the complete failure of his government’s Skill India programme. According to the ASER report, only 5 per cent of youth are \"taking some type of vocational training or other courses\". Just 5 per cent. That’s less than the proportion of such youth in Sri Lanka and Nepal, leave alone the rest of the world. For the RSS and its supporters, the ancient golden age of \"Bharat\" is an ever-present model to attract ordinary Indians to their fold. \"India will once again become the world’s teacher\" - this promise is often heard from RSS men, BJP leaders and ministers alike. While a lie can possibly be turned into truth by repeating it ad nauseam, the same doesn’t hold true for grand promises. Last year, the central government  . This month, the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE) once again stalled the demand for the extension of the RTE Act. Moreover, there is a shortage of 9.4 lakh teachers in government schools where the poorest children study. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, only half of all secondary school teacher posts have been filled. In Bihar and Gujarat, one third of them are vacant. Among the other alarming findings of the ASER report is the abysmal \"awareness\" level of India’s rural youth. Less than half of them were unable to locate their own state on the map. Only 64 per cent of them knew that Delhi is India’s capital and nearly 14 per cent of them didn’t recognise India’s map. The prime minister, especially believes in the power of apps and internet, but again, the bulk of India’s youth are deprived of access to the new knowledge-based economy. The   says that  only \"28 per cent had used the internet and 26 per cent had used computers in the last week, while 59 per cent had never used a computer and 64 per cent had never used internet\". If we divide this on the basis of gender, we find that girls are lagging in internet usage also. The report found that, “while 49 per cent  of males have never used the internet, close to 76 per cent of females have never done so”. The proportion of mobile phone users was predictably higher at 73 per cent for all youth, here too more females (22 per cent) had never used a mobile phone as compared to males (12 per cent). If a \"Beyond Basics\" kind of survey is conducted among the youth who scaled the court complex in Udaipur and planted a saffron flag in the wake of the gruesome communal murder of migrant labourer Afrazul, the results are likely to be in consonance with the general findings of the actual report. Incidentally, Udaipur was the only district where the survey was conducted in Rajasthan. The findings for Udaipur are depressing, 96.8 per cent of the youth surveyed were not enrolled in any vocational course, less than half of them could do basic arithmetic, or recognise their own state on the map of India. This pattern repeats itself across different states. The crux of the ASER survey is clear. Most of India’s youth are uneducated, deprived of access to skills of the future, and live in abject hopelessness. In the absence of free and compulsory education till Class 12, many of the rural youth are forced to discontinue their education over reasons ranging from death in the family to the wedding of a sibling even as education is prioritised over practically everything in middle class Indian families. The whole family works in mission mode to ensure that their children ace their competitive exams and join a professional course, while the laggards make up by buying seats in colleges. On the other hand, in the other India which lives in villages and small towns, the youth lives in a deep and dark well which is illuminated by TV and mobile phones. In the absence of role models (40 per cent said they have none), their lives are a dark vacuum which can be easily filled by destructive, if not exhilarating purposes. The demographic dividend is real and inevitable, but are we as a country prepared to constructively engage the youth is the question that should be bothering our government? Because if the government continues to look at school education as business as usual, and ignore education, skills and employability of the future Indian workforce, then the demographic dividend will surely turn into a demographic disaster.","title":"India's demographic dividend is turning into a disaster","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-demographic-dividend-aser-education-slap-davos-skill-india-rte/story/1/21919.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15307},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"When he was inducted into the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government in 2014, Chandrakant Patil was considered a man for all seasons because of his ability to handle a number of issues besides his clean image. Three and a half years later, the revenue minister has become the epitome of goof-ups and misplaced priorities. Most recently, Patil found himself at the centre of controversy when he recited a Kannada song praising Karnataka, where he attended the inauguration of a Durga temple in Belgaum district. Patil opened his speech with \"Huttidare Kannada Nadalli Huttabeku (roughly translated as \"One should be born in Karnataka if one is born at all\")\". As expected, the Opposition is demanding Patil’s head for “insulting Maharashtra in Karnataka”. The controversy assumes political relevance owing to Maharashtra's long-pending border dispute with Karnataka. Belgaum is the centrepoint of the chorus for the demand for the merger of Karnataka’s Marathi-speaking border areas with Maharashtra. Patil has effectively given the Opposition an opportunity to target the state government for its “double standards” over the decades-old issue. “We were aware of the BJP’s affection for Gujarat. Now, it has developed love for Karnataka. Chandrakant Patil has stabbed the people of Maharashtra in the back,” said Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar. He even asked for the minister's resignation in a tweet. \r\n \r\n Patil has become a habitual offender when it comes to breaking Marathi hearts. Only two weeks ago, he had raised questions over the competence of BJP workers in the state. Speaking at a conclave of teachers in Beed, Patil had said it had become difficult to find leaders of character for various important posts in the party. “We won’t find such people even if we look for them with binoculars,” he had said, in an apparent dig at \"incompetent\" BJP workers. He had also found himself in a spot in October 2017 when he provided wrong information about the ownership of two flats in the possession of state Congress president Ashok Chavan’s daughters – Shrijaya and Sujaya. While he has apologised to BJP workers over his remarks in Beed, Patil clarified that he spoke in Kannada recently as the native audience could grasp only that language.  The goof-ups are likely to hamper his political career, considered bright till a couple of months ago. A smear campaign has already been conducted within the BJP to curtail Patil’s phenomenal political growth. He was an office-bearer at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Kolhapur office till 2010, when the BJP inducted him full time and made him contest the legislative council election from the graduates’ constituency. Patil secured a comfortable victory but kept a low profile, following his Sangh ideals. His stature in the party started growing since Amit Shah became BJP's national president. Both of them share very good relations since Shah’s wife comes from Patil’s hometown Kolhapur. Patil has had close ties with Shah’s in-laws since his days in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in late '80s. He became number two in the Fadnavis Cabinet following the ouster of then revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who was the party's most senior face. On at least three occasions, when there were speculations over Fadnavis being replaced as the CM, Patil emerged as a frontrunner for the coveted post. First, it was the outcry of the Maratha community demanding reservation in education and government jobs. Later, the unprecedented agitation by farmers demanding a better price for their produce and, recently, the protests by Dalits following clashes at Bhima Koregaon on January 1 made Patil feel that he stood a chance to lead Maharashtra in the event Fadnavis is asked to step down for “mishandling” the crisis. It created the impression that Patil, a Maratha, could succeed Fadnavis, a Brahmin. The situation has rapidly changed and an impulsive Patil alone is responsible for that. He has become the target of detractors within the BJP. A source in the party claims that a whispering campaign has been engineered over Patil’s caste. Some have started circulating a message that says Patil is a Jain not a Maratha. It points out that there are many Jains in western Maharashtra, especially in Kolhapur and Sangli, who carry Marathi surnames like Patil. That Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, the founder of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, a major education trust in Sangli, was a Jain. The message asks what Chandrakant Patil has done for the welfare of Maratha students as the head of a committee constituted to deal with issues pertaining to the community, such as reservation and scholarships. If the message is an indication, it is the beginning of the decline of Patil’s influence.","title":"Why Chandrakant Patil is facing the heat in Maharashtra BJP","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrakant-patil-kannada-belgaum-devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-bjp-rss/story/1/21920.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15308},{"author":"Subhash Kak","content":"There was an outcry in the Indian media last week when  , minister of state for human resource development, reportedly said: \"Darwin's theory (of evolution) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on earth, he has always been a man.\" He was speaking to reporters in Aurangabad at the All India Vaidik Sammelan. He reportedly added: \"Nobody - including our ancestors - has said they saw an ape turning into a man. No books we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had such a mention.\" Indian scientists are shocked that the minister should speak thus against the idea of evolution which is fundamental to biology and medicine. How can the HRD minister be so ill-informed about science? This is all the more puzzling since he was a senior police officer before entering politics. Was the minister merely trying to be nice to the traditionalists at the Vaidik Sammelan, and he has no strong views on the matter, and perhaps the HRD ministry is safe under his leadership? My own thinking is that he is genuinely misinformed because, in reality, the idea of evolution (more general than Darwinian Evolution) is basic to all Indian thought, which is something that he does not appear to know. The least he can do is to understand both modern evolution theory and Indian ideas on it and then see how the education system in India can help people know the history of Indian ideas as well as the foundations of modern science. The Sankhya is the Indian theory of evolution, which is supposed to apply both to the individual and the cosmos. In it, the basic entities are pure consciousness and materiality (nature). Nature has three constituent qualities (gunas) called sattva, rajas, and tamas, and as the balance between these three changes the universe evolves. Out of the interplay of the five basic elements arise other principles (tattva): five subtle elements, five action senses, five senses of perception, mind, egoity, and intellect. The evolutionary sequence goes through many levels. The tattvas help in the emergence of life out of inert matter. The gu?as are not to be taken as abstract principles alone. Indian thought believes that structure in nature is recursive, and the gu?as show up in various forms at different levels of expression. The texts imply that ingredients for the growth of life are available throughout the universe. Infinite number of universes are conceived, so each new one is created like a bubble in an ocean of bubbles. The tattvas are not discrete and their varying expression creates the diversity of life in and across leading different species. Each sensory and motor tattva is mapped into a corresponding organ. Indian thought conceives of 8.4 million species, which is an impressive number, considering modern authorities estimate the number of extant species to be 4.5-10 million. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger thought that the S?nkhyan tattvas were the most plausible model for the evolution of the sensory organs. A quote on evolution on earth from the thousand-year-old, encyclopedic Yoga Vasistha (YV): Indicating the presence of other animals while the giant asuras were on earth, YV suggests that man arose later. YV also speaks of minor ages of destruction on earth that correspond to the yugas. The Indians believed that all life can be divided into three classes (Chandogya Upanishad 6.3.1): \"In truth, beings have here three kinds of seeds, born from the egg, born alive, and born from the germ.\" Given that it is also affirmed that life on other planets exists and that there was a gradual rise of life on the earth, it would appear that this implied a belief in a panspermia theory. Why aren't Indian ideas on evolution known to educated Indians? We see that Satyapal Singh did not need to deny evolution just to be on the right side of the remembered Indian tradition. The question then is: Why are the minister and other Indians ill-informed about their own sciences? India is the only major nation where history of science is not integrated in the school and college curriculum. People pick up bits and pieces on it from a variety of sources, such as tangential references in religious texts, and other sources many of which are unreliable or plain wrong. Superstitions arise in the absence of right knowledge and sunlight dispels darkness. A course on history of Indian science in colleges and universities will go a long way in presenting Indian scientific ideas to the next generation, and help people distinguish scientific ideas from mythology and fiction. The history of Indian science is not a politically divisive issue as it is not teaching religion or ritual. Why can't the HRD ministry take leadership on this issue?","title":"What Hindu tradition says about evolution","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/satyapal-singh-human-evolution-apes-scientific-thought-chandogya-upanishad/story/1/21888.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15309},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"The Supreme Court on Friday decided that the judgment given in the Mahmood Farooqui case by the Delhi High Court is a  . The top court, comprising a bench of justices SA Bobde and L Nageshwar Rao,   of the American scholar against the high court judgment which acquitted Farooqui of rape charges, on the first hearing itself. While acquitting Farooqui, the Delhi High Court had controversially said, \"Sometimes a feeble no, means yes.\" There was much hope pinned on the apex court when the matter reached its door. In a hearing that lasted about 20 minutes, some observations and questions raised by the Supreme Court bench were deeply troubling. Here is a short account of the hearing because I was present in the courtroom: It began with the bench pointing out how the two (Farooqui and the woman) weren't strangers to each other. Justice Bobde observed, \"She knows him [Farooqui] well enough to make a drink for him.\" The bench went on to question the lawyer, \"How many times did the complainant visit the house of Farooqui alone.\" The court referred to an earlier incident when the complainant and Farooqui kissed despite the presence of Farooqui's wife in the house. The bench mistakenly thought that the incident is of the same day, but advocate Vrinda Grover informed that the instance of kissing did not happen on the day of the incident. The bench went into a discussion on whether the complainant faked an orgasm which could have led Farooqui to believe that she gave her consent. The bench asked: \"So, how did she communicate that she didn't have the  ? The lawyer responded by saying that the complainant said no several times. The judge interjected by saying, \"Initially yes, but later there is a response wherein she says she faked (orgasm). People give fake smiles all the time. But how could the alleged accused know it was fake. She said she was afraid but what she did was completely contrary to someone who would be afraid.\" The court insisted Vrinda Grover read the email written by the complainant to the accused after the incident, which talks about how the complainant felt her sexual autonomy is violated, how Farooqui became forceful and how she \"went along\" because she was scared. The complainant also told Farooqui how his behaviour was inappropriate and went on to say, \"I love you and wish well for you but..\" The court picked on this line: \"Ms Grover in how many cases have you seen the victim saying I love you to the accused.\" The lawyer tried to explain how it happens in cases where parties have known each other and victims are still coming to terms with their trauma. The court dismissed the plea. There are two grounds on which the court primarily dismissed the appeal against the high court judgment. The first was whether the absence of consent was properly communicated to Mahmood Farooqui as the parties were known to each other and had a history of kissing each other. The apex court seems to believe that because the complainant faked an orgasm towards the end of the sexual activity, it gave the defendant a presumption of consent. This argument is flawed. First, if the complainant had repeatedly   when the sexual activity began then faking an orgasm at the end cannot be conclusive proof that she consented. Consent in law is understood as the ability and freedom to make choices. The victim says she feared for her safety hence she \"went along\". This issue was dealt with in case of Doyle (2010) by the Court of Appeal in UK. The court came to the conclusion that the fact that the victim \"just let him get on with it\" was held to be no consent as there was a fear of harm. In this case one can argue that the fear of harm was not immediate. Most common law countries follow this proposition. One can of course debate whether the threat of harm was immediate or imminent or whether the complainant was reasonable in holding such a belief. But the mere faking of an orgasm towards the end cannot be conclusive for Farooqui to reach the conclusion that she consented. Let's move to the aspect of the proximity or the relationship between the parties. Both knew each other and had exchanged kisses earlier. But the past sexual conduct cannot be at any stage adduced as evidence for consent unless it can be directly established that it impinges upon the right of fair trial for the defendant. The test for adducing the evidence of past sexual conduct is pretty high even under the Indian law. It cannot be brought forth in ordinary circumstances, at least the law doesn't say so. In such a scenario for the bench to make observations like \"she knew him well enough to make a drink for him\" or \"how many times she visited the house alone\" raise some disturbing questions. I wonder, whether the sexuality of a woman continues to be on trial. The bench did clarify that they were not implying that making a drink or visiting someone's house gives one the right to rape, but having such questions is in itself problematic in a deeply violent and patriarchal society. The language used in a rape trial is an important component in the entire process of delivery of justice. At no point did the court delve into the fact that the defendant was intoxicated. Was he capable of understanding the verbal and non-verbal cues of the complainant? Why wasn't the conduct of the defendant who was arguably in a position of trust not questioned at any point? Now to the second and more disturbing aspect, which is of the email sent on March 30, 2015, two days after the incident. It is true that the complainant does say that \"I love you…\" but here is the full text of that email:  (Source: Judgment of Delhi HC). Few days later, on April 12, 2015, the complainant writes another mail which literally abuses Farooqui for the trauma and pain and how the experience has been haunting her ever since. These mails should be understood in the proper context. This is an account of a woman who is still coming to terms with what has happened with her. As women, we often deny our realities unless they start haunting us. This is very well documented especially in cases where the victim and offender have known each other. The words \"I love you\" should not be misconstrued without proper context and understanding. This is not about a lawyer weighing her each and every words, imagining this to be used as evidence in court, but rather a woman who is finding it difficult to accept the reality in the wake of a saexual assault. Eventually it is for the courts to decide whether there was consent or not and yes the case of Farooqui is a difficult one. But the case has to be dismissed or admitted for the right reasons and in cases of sexual assault one can't ignore the language of it. The language is as important as the substance.","title":"How the courts failed in interpreting consent in Mahmood Farooqui rape case","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mahmood-farooqui-case-consent-sexual-assault-orgasm-supreme-court/story/1/21891.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15310},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves for Davos to attend and address the  , the annual meeting in praise of global capital and globalisation, of reading the world as an interconnected place of interlocked economies and nations – seems poised at a cliffhanger. With the one-of-a-kind American president in Donald J Trump, whose protectionist   motto is exactly the opposite of what WEF has stood for, there’s bound to be “clashes”, if not among personalities, at least among competing ideas at the forum in the snow-clad Swiss Alps, despite the   on the mountains, thanks to India. With both Modi and Trump scheduled to give keynote addresses – Modi at the opening plenary session on   and Trump on the last day,   – it seems the organisers have tried their best to avoid awkwardness, and any hijacking of the forum by Trump with his anti-globalist ideas. While there have been protests against WEF by the anti-globalisation activists of the left, environmentalists, anti-capitalists from Europe and Latin America, the concern about Trump is unique, since it’s the US president this time, usually a force of globalisation and undeterred flow of global capital, who is spewing policies and ideas that are clearly in the “far-right” of the socioeconomic spectrum. On the other hand, despite immense criticism at home, Prime Minister Modi, who’s the first Indian PM to make an official trip to Davos after two decades since former   went in 1997, stands for pitching India as a global investment destination, even though it’s not going to be the easiest of tasks. With the investment-to-GDP ratio dipping at home, and the economic indicators that were paraded by the government, such as the   and the World Bank  , both having faced  , thereby stealing Modi’s thunder somewhat with hard data, the task has become more uphill. In fact, India is that rare big emerging economy that has seen its  , while the world economy as such showed a healthy upward swing, 10 years since the 2008 Wall Street crash. This has been attributed to the twin economic shocks – demonetisation and GST – and PM Modi will have a hard time explaining the counter-trend in India as opposed to the global upswing. This means at the World Economic Forum, which is hosting 2,500 delegates including several heads of states or elected premiers, along with 120 global CEOs, Modi and Trump would be doing the opposite jobs. While Modi will be looking for more FDI – it’s significant that 100 per cent   via automatic route has been sanctioned just before the WEF 2018 – and “hard-selling India” as a brilliant investment destination, Trump will be selling his America First policies to retain most of the CEOs who happen to be Americans, to pick the United States over emerging economies with huge markets such as India and China. With business heads, prime ministers and presidents of countries, academicians, philanthropists, environmentalists, Silicon Valley honchos, human rights activists and members from art and cinema all descending on Davos for the WEF, it’ll be the usual potpourri of intense debates around the biggest hot-button issues of our times.  These  narrow nationalisms (including the Trump variety, but also perhaps the Modi variety), climate change, cyber-security and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation in manufacturing that is posing a serious threat to low-end jobs, refugee crises such as plight of the Rohingyas, and the ongoing battles creating fresh flux of conflict migrants, ecological damage owing to urbanisation, depletion of forest covers for agriculture and industry, river and ocean water pollution, etc. On the sociopolitical side, the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and the #MeToo movement and the new feminist wave gripping the world, the demand for new equality, the women’s marches in the United States but also in other countries, the rights of LGBTQ peoples and their battles with law and social prejudice, especially in a country like India, sex education and reproductive rights for women, etc, would figure prominently in the debates. Released a week before the WEF commences, the   underlines all the major threats and the likelihood of their occurrence or intensification, that the global systems need to face together. These include extreme weather events, natural disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud/theft, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, climate/war-induced involuntary migration, terror attacks, illicit trade, asset bubbles in major economies, weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear arms race, biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, spread of contagious diseases, water crises, food shortage, among others. In fact, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum has clearly stated in the risk report that “unilateral nationalisms” pose a threat to the joint action needed to mitigate these enormous challenges, making a thinly veiled reference to Trump. While Europe is banking on French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bring more collaborative projects together, the presence of post-Brexit United Kingdom prime minister Theresa May, is likely to add to the clamour. Last year, in the aftermath of Trump’s election to the White House, WEF found an unlikely foothold in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ode to globalisation, underlining the great irony of a communist country head batting for the global capital and free market of funds and ideas. While Xi hogged the limelight and China filled in the huge vacuum left by the US in matters of international leadership, this time,   by Xi’s economic adviser Liu He, amid concerns over One Belt One Road initiative’s possible . This leaves a big opportunity for PM Modi to pitch India’s as the global destination for investments. As part of his Make in India scheme, PM Modi is likely to use the hoopla surrounding his Davos visit to signal that India is greenlighting major global companies to invest in India. His business dinner with corporate heads on January 22 and his   on   at the opening plenary session are both being looked forward to by Indian and foreign observers alike.    Though Union finance minister   the WEF, PM will be accompanied by a retinue of ministers, including Piyush Goyal, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan, MJ Akbar and Jitendra Singh at Davos, and Modi’s motto is going to be  .  In two recent interviews, a rare occurrence in themselves, PM Modi maintained that his stint at Davos would be about “sharing his vision for India’s future engagement with the international community”. PM Modi is likely to meet Swiss premier Alain Berset to discuss issues of financial transparency and black money. Being the face of the world’s seventh largest economy with an excellent growth rate that was stymied somewhat by the twin shocks of 2016 and 2017, PM Modi’s handling of the 2.3 trillion dollar economy has been keenly watched in the almost four years into his government’s tenure. While the Indian delegation of business leaders and members of the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry), including Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Chanda Kochar, Uday Kotak, Ajay Singh, Rahul Bajaj, among others, will be signing or negotiating pacts with their foreign counterparts, superstar and king of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan will receive the annual Crystal Award (along with Cate Blanchett and Elton John) for his work towards “improving the state of the world”. While Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, has confirmed that PM   with 60 top global CEOs, including 20 from India, on January 22 night, would be a big deal, literally, other informal interactions at the sidelines with representatives of General Motors, Sakesforce, Royal Dutch Shell, Nestle, JP Morgan, Airbus, Hitachi, BAE Systems, IBM, etc would be top calls on the part of the prime minister. The mix of soft power in the yoga classes, as well as the hard power through strong negotiations at the financial high table, would nevertheless be met with puzzling questions on India’s economic performance at home, as well as the case of Aadhaar which has now garnered  , despite fawning editorials earlier. This would naturally put a question mark of Modi’s other flagship scheme, Digital India, and would also sit well with the prognosis on data fraud and risk posed by digitisation encapsulated in the Global Risk Report 2018 by the WEF organisers themselves.","title":"World Economic Forum 2018: Anti-globalist Trump and FDI-hungry Modi stand for clashing trends in Davos","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/world-economic-forum-2018-davos-donald-trump-narendra-modi-climate-change-diplomacy-foreign-relations/story/1/21889.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15311},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a hit in front of crowds — with millions of people watching him, waiting for him to speak, looking up to his podium with the adoration one reserves for deities. Yet, for all his charisma, it is hard to get a one-on-one with the PM. It is a rare occasion when one gets to see Narendra Modi answer questions posed by an individual in a closed room. So it was an “Eid ka Chaand” moment when Zee News’ Sudhir Chaudhary got the PM to give him an  . Even when faced with softball questions, PM Modi managed to give a few biting replies that will help bolster his supporters' affection and raise many an eyebrow — especially among his critics and detractors. Responding to a question on democracy and criticism, the PM  : “Criticism should not be seen as bad and this is the strength of democracy where everything must be analysed. Good things should be praised and shortcomings should be criticised.” About the criticism of the BJP government’s economic and financial decisions — including GST, demonetisation and the GDP growth rate slowdown — Modi said it is healthy since the country’s focus has shifted towards economy and growth. He added, however, that the BJP government has faced “less criticism and more allegations” and that issues like corruption and black money have long been a topic of discussion. He also  , “Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST. We brought economic reform, built toilets, brought electricity to 18,000 villages. The success of GST lies in the power of the federal structure. It takes time to adjust to change, but the outcome will be good.” But it was not just criticism the PM spoke about. On being asked about his unique diplomatic style — as he has demonstrated with world leaders like former US president Barack Obama, current US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Modi said he is an ordinary person and that is what helps other leaders befriend him. “Every time I stand besides world leaders like Putin or Trump, all I remember is that I am the representative of 125 crore Indians. They have given me the mandate to be there. We must also remember world is an interconnected entity and we cannot live in isolation.” Continuing on his interactions with world leaders and India’s position in the world, Modi said: “India has been instrumental in bringing world’s attention to financial transparency. It was acknowledged by former United States president Barack Obama.” Modi further stated that the Word Economic Forum (WEF) in  , Switzerland — to be held on January 22 and 23 — will be a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with the strength of demographic dividend: “Davos is a major platform in the financial world. Many business leaders gather there to deliberate upon the economic future of the world. India is the centre of attraction for the entire world. There are two reasons for that. First, our GDP is growing at a fast pace — and this has been accepted by leading agencies like the World Bank, Moody's etc; second, due to our strong democratic values. It's a unique combination of both in India. And that's what has evoked everyone's interest. So it's an opportunity for India to showcase itself on a global platform like WEF in Davos.\" Speaking of the Opposition, the PM said that the UPA government “did not address the issues of states. The central government did not listen to us. We respect the federal structure. Hence, we were forced to take economic and monetary reforms”. GST is the product of such a reform, he added. “We have worked hard towards building the concept of one nation-one tax.” Modi also spoke of a number of development issues, especially pertaining to the financial. “The country has witnessed a growth of 70 lakh accounts of employee’s provident fund. The Mudra Scheme launched by the Centre has also been successful. The initiative of government e-market has empowered small-scale entrepreneurs across the country. It has not only helped in reducing government’s expenditure but also dismantled the monopoly of big entrepreneurs.” Several times during the interview, referring to the gigantic mandate that got him elected, Modi said, “My work is to be the voice of 125 crore citizens and I am trying to do that honestly.”","title":"'Don't judge me on demonetisation and GST': Modi talks tough on criticism in interview","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-interview-zee-news-gst-demonetisation-netanyahu-gdp-growth/story/1/21856.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15312},{"author":"Pooja Shali","content":"The news of the impending disqualification of   for allegedly holding office of profit spread like wildfire in newsrooms today (January 19) afternoon. According to AAP leaders, the matter to be referred to the president of India is without a complete hearing of the \"office of profit\" case. With that, the expected political blame game ensued throughout the day. Soon after coming to power in 2015, the AAP government had passed an amendment to the Delhi Members of Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1997 to \"exempt the post of parliamentary secretary from the definition of office of profit with retrospective effect\". The Kejriwal government later appointed 21 AAP legislators as parliamentary secretaries in order \"to assist ministers in speedy implementation of work\". The party even claimed that the 21 MLAs won't take any remuneration and so wouldn't fall under the office of profit regulations. It was the Congress, which on June 9, 2016 had moved the poll panel seeking disqualification of the 21 MLAs. Considering that one of them, Jarnail Singh, had resigned to contest the Punjab Assembly polls, the number stands at 20 now. The disqualification of the MLAs will pave way for by-elections in the Delhi Assembly. Sources claim 11 MLAs have been heard by the Election Commission and their statements recorded so far. The AAP, however, says these were not part of official hearing as the case was still in early stages of designating if EC, as a constitutional body, should hear the matter. Around 2pm today, reporters claimed their sources in the Election Commission (EC) hinted at a possible recommendation being sent to the president's office. It was also reported that the recommendation letter would agree that the MLAs received undue privileges as parliamentary secretaries, an additional position given to elected representatives (the appointments were against protocol). \r\n \r\n There, however, was no official announcement by the EC in this regard, neither a confirmation nor a denial. And this is what has precisely got the AAP's goat. The party leaders attacked the Election Commission for acting \"as an agent of the BJP\" and \"leaking information to the media\". \r\n \r\n The development signals considerable trouble for the AAP, which also heads the government in Delhi. AAP MLA Madan Lal rushed to the Delhi High Court in the hope of managing to get a stay order on the case. The court, instead, refused any interim relief and will hear the matter again on Monday at 4pm. The HC also reiterated to the party that the court has already deemed the positions unconstitutional last year and would not interfere further, asking the party to approach and respond to EC summons. \r\n \r\n \"If approved by the president, 20 of the 66 MLAs will be disqualified, with immediate effect. With 46 in tow (BJP-3,  SAD-1), they would still retain majority in the 70-member Assembly.   Interestingly, two MLAs within the AAP are anyway considered \"opposition\" - the vocal critic Kapil Mishra and Pankaj Pushkar, a supporter of Yogendra Yadav. So, the number would unofficially stand at 44 , for the AAP.  Delhi will have to then brace for by-polls to 20 empty seats. The situation, however, is purely hypothetical right now considering neither the EC nor the president's office has confirmed the \"movement of the file\". Sources maintain that the notice has been received and is under consideration. As reporters rushed to the AAP office by 3pm, party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj launched a scathing attack against the EC, making a personal remark about CEC AK Joti's age and his approaching retirement. “AK Joti was the principal secretary under [the then Gujarat chief minister] Narendra Modi and then the chief secretary of Gujarat. He is retiring on Monday. So you want to repay Modiji’s debt. You are mortgaging a constitutional post like the Election Commission,” Bhardwaj said. But the matter is at sub-judice, a fact that the AAP spokespersons were quick to remind. Party leaders, meanwhile, started to reach Arvind Kejriwal's Civil Lines residence and went into a huddle. Each AAP insider, I spoke to, expressed deep anger against the Union government, before the line either got cut or went on hold. The party leaders were oscillating between \"breaking news\" correspondents and chalking out a survival strategy. Since its inception, the AAP has accused most existing institutions of being corrupt and anti-people - media houses, political parties and bureaucracy had been declared as bought-off by the rich and the powerful. The party eventually realised that, once in power, the perpetual derogatory tone is not the best way forward. Interestingly, the Election Commission's credibility had also been questioned occasionally by the party, but today the AAP came out all guns blazing. But it's debatable if their arguments were justified since rather than focussing on facts, party members primarily targetted the chief Election Commisioner over his alleged proximity to the BJP. But it seems the AAP is not alone. Many others are also raising questions over the EC's move. \r\n \r\n Did the EC give any reasonable evidence in its defence against AAP's allegations that an independent organisation has compromised its credibility at the behest of a ruling party at the Centre? Well, an explanation by the EC will clear the air, before Arvind Kejriwal seizes the opportunity.","title":"AAP MLAs disqualification: How the 'office of profit' case unfolded","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-20-mlas-office-of-profit-election-commission-ak-joti-bjp-bypolls/story/1/21854.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15313},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"A fortnight after the riot at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on January 16 exhorted BJP workers to get into election mode in the next six months. That has led to speculation that the BJP might prepone Assembly election in Maharashtra by a year along with polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram. In his fourth year as the CM, Fadnavis' hopes to retain power are pinned on two \"achievements\" — his government’s social welfare schemes and the scattered opposition. While the first one has failed to convince the BJP cadre, the second situation might not last long, in the rapidly changing political scenario. Fadnavis has been insisting that BJP workers go out in public beating the drums on his government’s two goals, water conservation and debt-free farmers. The state’s flagship scheme, Jal Yukta Shivar, aimed at making 5,000 villages free of water scarcity every year, has delivered impressive results in some areas. The government has managed to deposit Rs 28,000 crore in the farmers’ bank accounts in an attempt to make them debt-free. However, neither the party workers nor its elected representatives are enthusiastic in advertising the government’s work. On the political front, the main opposition parties, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), are slowly but steadily working on their respective revival plans. The Congress has suddenly started feeling energetic after the Bombay High Court refused to prosecute its state president Ashok Chavan in the Adarsh society scam on technical grounds. Now, as he has no fear of action, Chavan is expected to come up with a broad strategy to corner the government. Confident that the government will not take any action against its two top leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the multi-crore irrigation scam, the NCP too has launched aggressive posturing against the government’s policies. A source told   that a fact-finding committee has not found any evidence of Tatkare’s involvement in the irrigation scam. On the contrary, the committee has pointed fingers at Pawar, whom the government does not want to touch due to several political compulsions. Caught in a tricky situation Fadnavis has only one option — boosting the morale of the BJP workers. He needs to pay attention to their grievances and demands and pat their back to make them feel they are also part of the government. His statement on poll preparedness is sparked by the sense of uneasiness he has noticed across the state.

Now, imagine what happens when the snow on these high mountains melts at a faster rate in view of the rising global temperature? From Jammu and Kashmir in the west, to Arunachal Pradesh in the east, India is blessed with an almost 2,500km-long Himalayan range with varying biodiversity in sync with altitudes. This includes Ladakh and parts of Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) that fall in the trans-Himalayan region. This is all part of the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region spanning eight countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (under Chinese occupation), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar — dependent on and facing similar problems due to the rising temperature in the HKH region. Ladakh has been witnessing increasing temperatures. Precipitation (snowfall in case of Ladakh) has been erratic to say the least. On the other hand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have been witnessing similar developments with springs going dry early each passing year. Mountain communities are dependent on the local springs for their daily water needs rather than the massive rivers gushing through deep gorges or meandering through valleys. What people on the ground and experts have been saying has been corroborated in a report that will soon be released. The changing climate is indeed a serious issue when it comes to the Himalayas, the repository of snow/glaciers that feed billions in the subcontinent. As part of the Paris Agreement, more than 190 countries have committed to reducing their green house emissions and taking various measures to ensure that the global temperature does not go beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (as compared to the pre-industrial time). But, even when the world manages to maintain the global temperature rise average at 1.5 degrees Celsius, there will be a rise of 2 degrees Celsius or more in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region by the end of the century, resulting in a substantial decrease in snowfall and melt rates increasing by at least 33 per cent. This is already happening as temperature increases more rapidly in the high-altitude region, points out a report being coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ), an inter-governmental organisation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (China), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The soon-to-be published report \"Comprehensive Assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) Region\", as part of the \"Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( )\" that is coordinated by the ICIMOD, points to a decrease in snow-covered areas and snow volumes over the coming decades in response to the increased temperatures and to the rise in the snowline elevation. The rising temperatures in the Ladakh region, made up of Leh and Kargil districts, should be a cause of immediate concern. Leh’s annual precipitation is about 100mm, all snow. Kargil receives more precipitation than Leh. For centuries, the region has received snow starting from October till March, vital for the survival of Ladakhi people and agriculture. Of this, snowfall in December, January and February is most important. But the scores of people whom I met last year and still others who I spoke with this year have been complaining about how snow has been missing for almost the whole of December in Leh town (about 11,000feet) and villages at a relatively lower altitude. A quick glimpse at the   (CRIS) of the Hydromet division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Leh shows that between 2012 and 2016, snowfall in November for four out of five years showed 100 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. For December, three out of five years show above 90 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. I called Sonam Lotus, who heads the IMD’s Jammu and Kashmir office, to understand what this data means. “Although just five years’ data is not sufficient to predict a trend, it is nevertheless true that snowfall in Ladakh has been variable and inconsistent. But one thing our records show is that there has been a significant increase in temperature (in Ladakh) especially after the 1980s,” he told me. Earlier, when there was snowfall, the snow would remain for almost a week or more. But now it melts in just two days, he observed, arguing that the increasing number of people (including the large number of tourists) and vehicles have pumped enthno-carbon and other green house gases into the atmosphere as Ladakh witnesses a drastic change, positive by conventional standards, in the standard of living. While talking about the future of the mountain communities and how their lives and livelihoods are integral to the well-being of the mountains, a common factor that comes forth across regions is the participation of the communities themselves. Unfortunately, government programmes largely neglect local communities. Be it the dams in the fragile Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, be it factories set up along the rivers in the Himalayan foothills or the mounting problem of municipal solid waste, the government wants to keep away the community and bring in an outsourced partner. For decades now, the effects of such a debilitating approach are for all to see. It simply has not worked because community participation is the key to conservation, the key to ensure that local and global interests are taken care of. One of the best examples is the World Wide Fund: India’s Western Arunachal Landscape programme, which began in 2010, has been monitoring the presence of and working for the conservation of threatened species along with the local Monpa population of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The community was faced with the crisis of springs drying faster — a continuous topic of discussion among the community and the WWF people. “Our conservation programme are primarily community conserved programmes, managed and owned by the local community. It is for their interest, to secure their livelihood and their ecological needs. For many years now, the community has been talking about the need for spring rejuvenation. We now plan to study and identify the springs in these two districts as a pilot project,” said Kamal Medhi, WWF-India coordinator, Western Arunachal Landscape. It is the tenacity of the communities that will help in the long run, with or without government help. But having committed to the United Nations via the Paris Agreement, governments of the HKH region countries are duty-bound to help their mountain communities. Going beyond the geo-political boundaries, these communities have had a healthy cultural exchange and a thriving trade. Even today, positive case studies from one mountain community can be tried by others and the government can facilitate such experiments. After all, for the government of India, as for other countries, there are very limited options when it comes to water availability. Surely, the Himalayas and their glaciers, the snow and the rivers that sustain such an enormous population are vital for our survival.","title":"Rise in temperatures is threatening the survival of Himalayas","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/global-warming-climate-change-himalayas-ladakh-arunachal-extreme-weather/story/1/21812.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15315},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"To immense applause from almost every quarter have the Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs)   between the newfound friends India and Israel, with great energy and enthusiasm from the respective prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu. The chemistry and bonhomie have already become legendary, and among the most talked about MoUs has been the “ ” deal, involving cooperation and sharing of data in the fields of cyber security, energy and agriculture. Involving a   cutting across sectors, such as cyberspace, energy, agricultural technology, Internet of Things and Internet of Energy, the big data deal has been pegged as “boosting measures... to revolutionise Indian farm production”. According to the Union ministry of external affairs website, the   signed between India’s Vijay Gokhale, MEA’s secretary of economic relations, and Israel’s Yuval Rotem, “envisages cooperation in the field of cyber security to develop, promote and expand cooperation in the field of HRD through various platforms and arrangements such as training programmes, skill development, and simulator based hands-on training. It also envisages collaborating in the field of cyber security resilience, promoting B2B cooperation in cyber security and facilitating industrial summits”. While the MoU between the respective ministries of petroleum and natural gas/energy cooperation states that it’s about “looking to explore opportunities of long-term cooperative relationship and joint economic projects to enhance bilateral engagements in the field of Oil and Gas, inter-alia including collaboration in upstream sector activities; R&D and Technology; promoting institutional linkages between Universities and R&D establishment for mutually beneficial collaboration; and in the area of Start-ups”. Another related MoU has been signed between Invest India and Invest in Isarel – respective platforms – with the purpose of “supporting and developing cooperation between the two sides through exchange of information on investment opportunities, relevant laws and regulations, policies and government initiatives”. Keeping these three MoUs in mind, it’s important to look at another related news which claims that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is set to  , a “big data and smart city tech provider”, which is an important business delegate of visiting PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s official retinue. Reported by a number of websites, the then imminent deal was about RIL’s “move to get deep into the smart city, big data, defence and critical infrastructure space”. As reported by  , this deal is about RIL getting “access to next-level technology on a number of mission-critical monitoring systems, big data analytics software for power utilities, industrial internet of things (IoT), smart cities, critical infrastructure and defence sector”.   quotes an official part of the B2B event, saying: “mPrest places a specific focus on the IoE (Internet of Energy) sector. Its power utility offering is a ‘System of Systems’ platform with applications including DERMS (distributed energy resource management), asset health management, mobile asset management, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) enhancement and critical infrastructure protection security, and cyber management”. It’s important to read these two news items together to arrive at, if not a set of conclusions, certainly a set of pressing questions. Given the critical big data deal between Israel and India comes at a time when extremely sensitive matters of the very constitutionality of such mass-scale data scooping, collation and storage without the citizens’ informed consent, and/or any informed opinion on the technologically nebulous issues, are being heard in the top court of India, how are we to read this inter-governmental agreement, if not as an instance of technology-driven impatience of both governments and corporate behemoths? \r\n \r\n As reported in  , apparently, the data-driven methods are being shared and accessed to “fight cybercrimes”, and the request for access to big data was from the Israeli side in the context of “how technology can now be used to agglomerate vast amounts of information and then bear on individual field and individual farmer’s efforts, improve the yield”. It’s interesting that in a country in which the majority of “individual farmers” are either landless or with very small landing holdings, with virtually no access to digital tech or data thereof, even as they are being forced to obtain the biometrics-based Aadhaar card and then link it to other nodes of information/identity proofs, the peg on which the “big data deal” has been hung is agricultural technology via data analytics. In fact, Union minister of agriculture Radhamohan Singh “participated” in the delegation-level talks on agriculture collaboration using India’s population big database. Moreover, to questions of “safeguards in place to share Aadhaar-based data with Israel”, there were no clear answers, other than stating basis aspects of an agriculture-centric programme. While the digital push to augment agriculture might be commendable in theory, there have been reported instances of   a very tangible, essential, non-digital ingredient necessary for agriculture – the waters of Narmada River. Even as the Sardar Sarovar Dam has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with great fanfare, the   to “canals” and not farmlands, is becoming a huge bone of contention among the farmers of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Even Hardik Patel, the young Patidar leader who campaigned against BJP in Gujarat has tweeted his reaction to the agriculture-centric MoU between India and Israel based on the grievance on the ground. \r\n \r\n Given that the priorities of the government aren't exactly in perfect order when it comes to agriculture, with massive debt, rainfall lapses, crop failures and other endemic issues haunting tens of thousands of farmers, exactly how will a deal involving sharing of big data between governments and corporate behemoths - integrating the diverse investments in energy and telecom, while spreading its wings in emerging fields of data analytics and critical-monitoring systems - actually help the farmer in whose name the MoU has been signed? Which brings us to the next question: what about data security and privacy? What is the exact nature of the data that will be shared, and what all safeguards are being put into place? How is it that another country, Israel, is given access to India’s centralised databases, whose existence is under the scanner, and whose legality is being debated in the Supreme Court of India, as we speak? There have been a number of reports   by foreign agencies – whether foreign government-driven or private and commercial, but big enough to  , and the Aadhaar database –  as has been repeatedly proven –  is a  . In this context, it is important to ask if the inter-governmental MoU between India and Israel is at odds with the fundamental   of the individual farmer at whose behest the big data is being collected, shared with another country? All this at a time when a giant corporate entity from India, with extensive interests in oil and natural gas, telecom, etc is looking to not just   diverse fields, but also control the mechanisms of monitoring via   of Indians. As internet and privacy rights activists have asked, what does it mean to have “ ”? One of the fundamental premises is we must safeguard people, citizens, individuals, over innovations in technology that erode privacy, individuality, autonomy – informational and bodily. Aadhaar-based authentication and databases have proven to be structurally invasive and exclusionary, which means any technology based on, or dependent on, such a loophole-ridden system is problematic to the very core, at odds with India’s billion-plus citizens, who should not be treated as mere sources of data and be . In fact, Biju Janata Dal MP Tathagata Satpathy has argued on exactly this line, saying a line of argument that treats   should compensate citizens for sharing their data, not otherwise. Instead, if citizens are being harnessed and farmed for data, as it were, by governments, technology giants and corporate behemoths alike, then we have created a system that’s extremely problematic, to say the least.","title":"India-Israel ‘big data’ deal leaves questions about security and privacy unanswered","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aadhaar-benjamin-netanyahu-modi-india-israel-big-data-deal-privacy-surveillance/story/1/21823.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15316},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"I am not a very religious person, though I was born a Hindu. I do celebrate the festivals and follow most of the rituals. My father was a follower of the Arya Samaj and we had \"havans\" on all auspicious occasions, a tradition I continue to this day. I was born in Pakistan and growing up in newly independent India, differences of religion, caste or ethnicity were not something I was aware of. We were taught to respect everyone, regardless of their roots. Some may call me deracinated, and I have to confess I still do not know my \"gotra\", but I believe the greatest quality of Hinduism is its liberalism and its plurality. It is those qualities that are under threat today, as who we pray to and how we pray becomes politicised. Where there is religion, can politics be far behind? This unholy alliance is ruining the world. Our democracy has been weakened by vote bank politics. The most obvious manifestation of this is the culture of appeasement of minorities practised by the Congress party in the 49 years it ruled the country since Independence. The aggressive assertion of Hinduism, otherwise termed as Hindutva, that we are witnessing today is a backlash to this. As the BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe writing in this issue says, “it has spurred a mindless competition to get the tag of minorities”. This is not the way forward if we are to build an equitable society. The disadvantaged should be helped regardless of caste, creed or religion. It will happen only if we stop mixing politics with religion and prevent extremists from radicalising faith. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s new book,  , puts upfront a critical issue of our time - the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva. While Hinduism has a distinct cultural ethos with a common history, common literature and common civilisation, Hindutva believes Indian nationalism is the same as Hindu nationalism, and that non-Hindus must acknowledge their Hindu parentage or convert to Hinduism to return to their true cultural roots. Hindutva maintains that Hindus need to preserve and protect their religion and culture against the onslaught of a hostile, alien world. It is insecurity that drives this sentiment rather than strength, which is what Swami Vivekananda, who can only be described as the first rock star of Hinduism, believed in. I believe Hinduism teaches us to live amidst a variety of other identities, and to do anything differently would be, as Tharoor notes, a partition of the soul, after the partition of the soil. In the best traditions of the religion, we have invited reputed scholars, ideologues and politicians to debate the issue. There is former BJP general secretary, KN Govindacharya, who believes Hindutva means Hinduness and not Hindu nationalism in the Western sense; former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi says the freedom of a Hindu to self-define his or her dharma is the greatest asset of Hinduism; novelist Kiran Nagarkar calls out the Sangh Parivar for obliterating the inherent inclusive values of Hinduism; while the bestselling author Devdutt Pattanaik exposes the myth of the wounded Hindu, tormented by a thousand years of slavery at the hands of the invaders. There is much more. Some of it is despondent, such as author and translator Arshia Sattar’s argument that the distinction between Hinduism as plural and Hindutva as singular is being lost at the hands of the newly empowered local gatekeepers of Hinduism and active proponents of a \"Hindu Rashtra\". For a multi-cultural country like India to be divided on the basis of religion is a recipe for disaster. But I remain hopeful. After all, which other religion in the world can say that it does not claim to be the only true one?

The book was published on November 30, 2017, at Maseed Computer Centre at Barmal, in Afghanistan’s Paktika province. The 588-page book, posted online, contains TTP’s history, military operations, activities in Afghanistan, pictures of many Taliban leaders, and claims its involvement in a suicide bombing two months earlier at Bhutto’s procession in Karachi in October 2007, killing more than 140 people. The book claims that, “Despite attacks on Benazir Bhutto’s procession in Karachi, the government had not taken appropriate security measures that made it possible for the attackers to have easy access to Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi.” According to the book, Bhutto was killed since “her return was planned on the behest of the Americans as they had given her a plan against the ‘Mujahideen-e-Islam'. And slain Pakistan Taliban founder Baitullah Mehsud had received information of the plan”. For the first time, a terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the assassination which altered the political dynamics of Pakistan. Musharraf was accused of conspiring Bhutto’s assassination, murder trial remained controversial and Musharraf was declared fugitive. It is important to understand what compelled the TTP to make this announcement after 10 years. It would be useful to analyse some of the developments to be able to understand the unconventional move by the banned terrorist group. Pakistan's military launched a major offensive,  , in 2014 in North Waziristan and Khyber, following a major attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on June 8, 2014. The Operation was seen as a major success within Pakistan and the official records projected remarkable decrease in suicide attacks, terrorist attacks and fatalities in terrorist attacks. However, while the operation targeted a large number of TTP operatives, it did not manage to control the growth of extremism and terror within the country. There were major terror attacks in northwestern region conducted by Jaamat-ul-Ahrar (JA), a splinter group of TTP. The beginning of 2017 witnessed a series of terror attacks claimed by ISIS, challenging the success of the military’s counter-terror efforts. On February 22, 2017, Pakistan Army announced the launch of a nationwide military operation, Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. According to an ISPR release, “the efforts entail conduct of broad spectrum security/counter terrorism operations by Rangers in Punjab, continuation of ongoing operations across the country and focus on more effectives border security management. Country wide de-weaponisation and explosive control are additional cardinals of the effort\".  The operation came as a response to a series of at least six back-to-back attacks in Pakistan within a week (mid-February 2017), killing more than 100 people in different parts of Pakistan. One of the deadliest attacks in the string of terror attacks took place on February 16, when a suicide bomber blew himself up among the devotees in the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. The attack was claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) and resulted in about 88 deaths and 300 injured. On the same day, in Awaran, an IED attack on a military convoy took place. is a continuation of the \"National Action Plan\" which was formulated after the 2014 attack in Peshawar on Army Public School. Expectations with Radd-ul-Fasaad have been high and army has claimed positive results from the ongoing operation, but the fact remains, that military’s \"selective approach\" in targeting terrorists will never allow the counter-terror efforts to succeed. Pakistan's military has been extremely proud of its counter-terror operations as these efforts have assisted the military to regain its waning credibility and prestige after  . Pakistan did draw out some applause from the US administration for its efforts in April 2017. The US-Pakistan relationship has been strained over the past six years and took an unyielding shift with the announcement of President Donald Trump’s Afghan policy which carried a firm message for Pakistan. Trump excoriated Pakistan for harboring criminals and terrorists. The US   revealed in December 2017 also carries an equally harsh message for Islamabad. Pakistan denied the charges and has reacted strongly to the US stance, claiming that Islamabad has lost 50,000 civilians and 6,000 security personnel in the war on terror and Washington cannot ignore these sacrifices. Although the US-Pakistan relationship is at the lowest in the past 16 years, the fact remains that both nations need each others’ support for various compelling reasons. While the US will require Pakistan’s support till it wants to continue its presence in Afghanistan, Pakistan is reliant on the US given its influence in international organisations. Washington is pressurising Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and Pakistan cannot afford not to take US concerns and stance into consideration. There have also been reports of ISIS establishing its base in Pakistan and spreading its tentacles. The  published by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, alleges that ISIS is especially active in northern Sindh and Balochistan. Given these developments - Pakistan's military rejoicing over its victory over terrorists (mainly TTP as it is the deadliest anti-state organisation), US pressure on Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and the threat posed by the expansion of ISIS - one can infer what led to Pakistani Taliban’s revelation of Bhutto’s assassination. The revelation at this point of time serves three main purposes for the TTP: • It is a repeat signal to Pakistan's military that TTP would counter every move of US-Pakistan partnership in counter-terror operations. • In the past one year, terror attacks by ISIS have been on the rise which poses a threat to TTP’s status. The announcement also helps the organisation to reassert its presence. • Lastly and very importantly, it brings Pakistani Taliban in news and national and international limelight in an effort to maintain its positon and status in the competitive world of terrorism. While Pakistan's military claims that terror attacks are reducing in numbers, the TTP appears to be intact and determined in its resolve to oppose the state.","title":"Why Pakistan Taliban is claiming it killed Benazir Bhutto","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/benazir-bhutto-assassination-pakistan-musharraf-tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-baitullah-mehsud/story/1/21782.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15318},{"author":"Ashok K Singh","content":"VHP leader  ’s allegations about \"conspiracy to kill him to weaken the Hindutva forces\" sound as startling as the Congress’s overtures to him appear to be confounding. But pause for a moment to think and you will see that it’s neither startling nor confounding. The Togadia episode fits in well with the current politics of the BJP as well as the Congress. The international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been out in the cold for the past many years. He is of no use to BJP stalwarts Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in their home state. Togadia had no role to play in the Gujarat Assembly elections or its politics for a long time now. Modi has been winning the state elections on his own steam since 2001. In the early years, Togadia’s rabble-rousing, Muslim-baiting rhetoric helped mobilise VHP workers in Modi’s favour, but gradually Modi cut him to size.  Notwithstanding his nuisance value and hate speeches, Togadia, perhaps, was an asset for the BJP before and during the Vajpayee era. So were Ashok Singhal, assortment of sants and sadhus and many of Sangh Parivar motor mouths. But the Ayodhya issue gradually lost momentum after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Although it prepared the ground for the first BJP-led government at the Centre, the party realised it was running out of agendas to keep the Hindutva pot boiling. Until Modi strode across the Gujarat landscape as he became chief minister in 2001. Soon 2002 riots happened and Modi burst onto the national scene. After the riots, Modi had no need for Togadia and his ilk in Gujarat. He emerged at the head of the hardline Hindutva, as its most potent mascot. He was capable of packaging VHP, Bajrang Dal, LK Advani and Vajpayee in one heady mix that became brand Modi. He could do everything that Togadia was capable of, and much more, but in a subtler manner. By Modi's second term as chief minister, Togadia and VHP became virtually irrelevant in Gujarat. The VHP and Bajrang Dal lost traction. In 2007 Assembly elections, Modi forced Togadia to stay out of Gujarat. In 2012 elections, a desperate Togadia tried to stage a comeback. He threw his lot with rebel BJP leader and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, but results reaffirmed Modi’s invincibility. The people of Gujarat had bought into Modi's cocktail of development and Hindutva.  Despite Modi facing rough weather in the recent Assembly elections, Togadia remained a persona non grata for the BJP.  His mysterious disappearance for a day, hospitalisation and press conference alleging that he feared for his life in \"fake police encounter\" at the behest of the forces that wanted to weaken the Hindutva cause can be understood in the background of his strained relations with Modi. But the Congress seems to be placing values on even a weakened and irrelevant Togadia. In its desperate bid to reclaim lost power, the Congress under the president Rahul Gandhi is prepared to adopt all means, including supping with disgruntled Hindutva forces. Senior Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia met Togadia at the hospital in public glare. He said he met the VHP leader in his “personal capacity”, but expressed concern about \"dangers\" to Togadia’s life. Rahul Gandhi’s ally in Gujarat elections, Hardik Patel, too met him. \r\n \r\n While they hit out at Modi and the Gujarat dispensation and demanded inquiry into Togadia’s allegations, it was ironical that they didn’t speak about the former doctor who has been a symbol of hate and bigoted politics. The BJP has asked the Congress to clarify its stand on whether the party supports the VHP leader. Hardik Patel posted a flurry of tweets before and after meeting Togadia. \r\n \r\n The Congress’s hobnobbing with the VHP leader is part of Rahul Gandhi’s grand strategy to take the fight to the BJP camp. Emboldened by restricting the BJP to under-100 seats in Gujarat after his temple-hopping, declaring himself a Shiv-bhakht and janeudhari, Rahul Gandhi has made his intentions clear: a brick for a brick and an eye for an eye in the run up to the 2019 elections. Karnataka is bracing for a contest for Hindu votes between the Congress and the BJP. Later in the year, the contest is set to become even more ugly as the politics of grabbing majority votes gathers moment. One can understand Rahul Gandhi’s compulsion in wooing Hindus to regain votes the Congress has lost to the BJP. What’s difficult to stomach is that the Congress is willing to court someone like Togadia, perhaps the biggest hate monger the country has seen in the post-independence period. The central leadership of the Congress has not commented on Modhwadia’s meeting with Togadia, which speaks of its dilemma on taking a clear- cut stand. The Congress should have explained why Modhwadia met him and why didn’t he condemn Togadia’s politics while demanding investigations into the VHP leader’s allegations. The Congress’s occasional dalliance with the RSS has been known. Indira Gandhi’s temple visits and Rajiv Gandhi’s courting of soft-Hindutva for votes and its terrible consequences are also known. But never has the Congress dared to have truck with any bigot or Muslim baiter like Togadia or has even given the impression that it's ready to do politics with such elements. Or has the difference between “soft” and \"hardline\" Hindutva been completely blurred?  ","title":"Newfound love for Pravin Togadia unmasks Congress' Hindutva agenda","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pravin-togadia-congress-rahul-gandhi-hardik-patel-vhp-modi-amit-shah/story/1/21788.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15319},{"author":"Claude Arpi","content":"On New Year's Eve, President Xi Jinping   to extend his greetings to all Chinese and… friends all over the world. Xi said that Beijing is dedicated to safeguarding peace. \"China will act as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and an upholder of the international order.\" Will this translate in peace on the border in 2018? Probably not! Rumours are circulating that troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have intruded in Gelling sector in the Siang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh. China has not fully digested the fact that India stood up for Bhutan when the PLA was trying to build a road in June near the trijunction between Sikkim and Chumbi Valley in Tibet. Quoting \"experts\", a PLA website admitted that China will be better prepared \"next time\": \"the recent Doklam standoff had propelled China to perfect its strategy in its western part\" said chinamil.com.cn. Zhao Xiaozhuo, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences is quoted by the same newspaper: \"India never takes road construction as an opportunity… and only thinks about its own interest.\" Was the road on Bhutanese territory really an opportunity for India? It makes no sense. During a recent press conference, the spokesperson of the China's ministry of national defence said India \"should strictly control its troops\". While China is getting ready for another standoff, Beijing deeply dislikes Delhi developing its side of the border.  resented the recent visit of the Indian Union home minister  ; Singh spent the New Year with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). \"An Indian road construction project connecting all border posts along the China-India frontier could lead to new military standoffs between China and India,\" warned another Chinese expert. China is unhappy because Rajnath Singh asserted that \"a number of border posts had already been connected with roads and many would soon be linked… this would enhance the operational efficiency of the officers and reduce mountain-related sickness among them.\" While Beijing is going full steam to build infrastructure on its side of the McMahon Line, it complains about Delhi building roads on India's borders; amazing double standards. Nelong Border Outpost (BoP), located at the height of 11,700 feet, is manned by the ITBP. Accompanied by ITBP director general, RK Pachnanda, the minister later visited Pulam Sumda (14,200 feet) and interacted with jawans and officers. The area is disputed by the Chinese only because Beijing refuses to adhere to the universally-accepted principle of \"watershed\" used for demarcating borders. In Nelang, the watershed in the area is located at Tsangchok pass, beyond Pulam Sumda. At the same time, Beijing does whatever it wants on its side of the border.  recently reported: \"Investment in infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is helping to lift 628 villages along the border out of poverty.\" The Chinese newspaper further asserted: \"After getting access to electricity and the construction of new roads, tea farmers and herdsmen in a village some 200 kilometres southwest of Lhasa in Tsona county founded a cooperative that provides skills training and job opportunities for villagers.\" Lepo, a tiny village, north of Khenzimane, the last border post on the McMahon Line is said to have received several thousands of visitors last year and adequate lodging facilities have been provided to them. China further admitted: \"Starting last year, more than 100 million yuan (Rs 99.4 crore) has been invested in infrastructure in villages of less than 100 families as a part of a broader construction project to build model villages in the border area.\"  estimated that by 2020, the road access rate in the area will reach 100 per cent and the per capita disposable income will double. Last week, Xinhua reported that China's least populated township had been connected to the national grid. It is Yume (also spelt Yulmed), the first hamlet north of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh.Remember, at that time of the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping had written a letter to two young Tibetan herders who had introduced their village to the Chinese president. It was the same Yume.  commented: \"A sparsely populated township has been connected to the state electricity grid, ending life without electricity for its 32 residents.\" The contractor, a Xining-based electric power company who worked on the project is quoted saying: \"The 15-kilometer 10-kilovolt power line, which took five months to complete, is connected via 108 electric poles over a 5,000-meter-high mountain.\" There are many such examples along the Tibetan side of the McMahon Line. Year 2018 may not be serene despite the peaceful vows of President Xi.

He is the third chief minister in four and a half years. Bizenjo replaced Sanaullah Zehri of the PML (Nawaz), who was forced to resign from office ahead of a no-confidence motion against him. Not surprisingly, 11 of the 14 incoming cabinet members are members of the PML(N). Most observers see this manoeuvre as the Pakistan Army’s move to punish former PM Nawaz Sharif by depriving his party of any sustenance. If anything, this is a sign that parties and ideology don’t matter in official Baloch politics, but it is individuals who are easily open to manipulation. In fact, Bizenjo won the 2013 election with just 544 votes cast in his favour. The turnout in his constituency was just 1.18 per cent. In 2013, PML(N) won a majority of seats and formed a coalition government and selected a middle-class Baloch nationalist, Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party as chief minister. But Malik had to make way for Zehri in 2015. Baloch nationalists opposed the elections and many boycotted the process. Even those who did participate, such as Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the leader of the Balochistan National Party, rejected the outcome, charging authorities with manipulating the results. Balochistan has suffered from prolonged political turmoil and successive phases of insurgency and violent religious extremism. The most recent bout of violence began in 2003 and is still continuing. In the period between 2011 and 2016, nearly 4,000 people were killed, including 1,000 classed as terrorists, who could be separatists or sectarian killers who target Shias in the Quetta area. In 2017, violence intensified with massive bombings in Quetta, and other areas targeting Shias, Sufis and security forces. At the end of the year, a bomb blast killed nine and injured 57 people when a Methodist Church was targeted by the Islamic State. The Pakistan Army has sought to use violent religious extremist groups to counter Baloch nationalism and blame India for the violence. There are of course nationalist groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army, Baloch Republican Army and Baloch Liberation Front. Pakistani authorities focus their ire on Brahamdagh Bugti of the BRA as the principal villain because he is openly pro-Indian and has even sought political asylum in India. But actually, most Baloch nationalists reject secession in favour of greater autonomy and the groups are hopelessly divided along tribal lines. Balochistan has now come into international focus because of a report that the Chinese may be establishing a naval base on the Jiwani peninsula, adjoining the port they built and operate in Gwadar. Not many are taken in by Beijing’s denial. As for Gwadar, it is the starting point of CPEC, which has become a flagship scheme of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan claims Chinese investments will generate jobs and prosperity for everyone, including the Baloch. The government believes that once the mega projects kick in, Baloch nationalism will lose steam. There is an element of wishful thinking in the Pakistani belief that CPEC will be an answer to all its problems and moderate Baloch nationalism. They believe the Baloch live in a feudal environment, dominated by their sardars and once the area is opened up, things will change. Pakistani authorities have shown little sophistication in addressing the challenge of violence in the province whose roots go back to the sensitive issue of Baloch identity. The Pakistani state, especially the Army, tends to see Baloch nationalism as a threat to Pakistan’s integrity. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to introduce the “Indian hand” as the cause of problems. They cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s references in his Independence Day speech in 2016 and their capture of naval officer Kubhushan Jadhav to back their claims. However, Modi’s reference was innocuous to say the least and as for Jadhav, there is no real proof that he was involved in doing anything in Balochistan. Politics are not normal in Pakistan, and even less so Balochistan. Violence and political turbulence are, of course, there, but the real problem is that it is somehow not seen as being part of the Pakistani mainstream. By and large, its parties are electoral coalitions that rise and come apart depending on the exigencies of power. Sentiments are with Baloch nationalists, but authority is exercised by an elite which is backed by the Army.

It is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with experts calling it the most sophisticated ID programme in the world. Yet, recent events have proven that this mammoth exercise, which the present government has further pressed hard to make a standard requirement for availing the most commonplace of benefits and services, also faces the equally mammoth threat — data leakage. On January 3,   said its correspondent was given access to personal data, including names, addresses, postal codes, photos, phone numbers and emails of Aadhaar card holders for as little as  What’s more, with an additional Rs 300, illegal operators provided her a \"software\" that could facilitate printing of the Aadhaar card after entering the Aadhaar number of any individual. The initial response of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), which implements Aadhaar, was one of the proverbial \"shooting the messenger\", but following the cacophony the issue raised, it stepped into some positive action. UIDAI restricted access of around 5,000 designated officials to the Aadhaar portal. It also allowed citizens to use a virtual ID that could be shared with all agencies, including the government, rather than the 12-digit Aadhaar ID, lending it more privacy. The next question that is being asked is, has the decision to provide a virtual ID made the Aadhaar more complicated for the masses? How many of the citizens will actually use the virtual ID? Wouldn’t there be a large section which is still vulnerable? While the concept of providing every Indian a unique ID was hailed by all, it was the manner of it being made compulsory to avail services — right from the distribution of subsidies, to paying income tax to purchasing mobile SIM cards and insurance or even procuring a death certificate — that made it controversial. Giving out the ID for such services so rampantly also exposed it to misuse by fraudsters. The issue has reached the apex court, which is hearing a slew of petitions relating to privacy issues around Aadhaar, including whether privacy is a fundamental right. On October 30, the Supreme Court referred all Aadhaar related cases to a five-judge Constitution bench. The Court, on December 15, extended the deadline to link Aadhaar with insurance policies, mutual funds holding and mobile phones to March 31 this year. The next hearing is scheduled on January 17. This is not the first time that issues of Aadhaar data breach have been raised. In July last year, there have been reports that customer data of a telecom firm, comprising sensitive details of millions of its users, including their Aadhaar numbers, was leaked online. Even then, there was a demand from experts that India needs to strengthen its privacy laws in line with the 2012 recommendations of the Justice AP Shah-led group of experts on privacy. In its report, the panel had said that a framework on the right to privacy in India must include privacy-related concerns around data protection on the internet, appropriate protection from unauthorised interception, audio and video surveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy including DNA as well as physical privacy. In the absence of strict privacy laws, intimate details of citizens can easily fall into the hands of fraudsters, which need to be avoided at all costs. Even the staunchest of opponents to Aadhaar feel that the government is unlikely to back away from continuing to insist on Aadhaar ID for most benefits and services unless the top court comes out with some severe strictures. Certain countries, however, have backtracked on such initiatives after discovering flaws in it. Reports say the UK scrapped its biometric identification plan in 2010 and destroyed the associated database. Meanwhile, the Social Security Number in the US is not biometric and is not used for basic services such as phones and credit cards that can lead to mass surveillance and breach of privacy. Moreover, countries like Germany do not impose biometric identification to deliver public services. It can be argued that the situation in India is different, given the rampant leakages in the subsidy system, which calls for a more foolproof identification system.

Be it the launch of his political memoir (third book in the series) in October last year or his bold address at the Aligarh Muslim University on founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s 200th birthday, Mukherjee chooses his words and events carefully. The former president is all set to visit Bangladesh on January 14 on a three-day trip. Needless to emphasise, he enjoys enormous goodwill in the neighbouring country. Held in very high esteem from the days of Bangladesh’s struggle for liberation, his fan following , cutting across party lines, is simply huge. Incidentally, the native place of Mukherjee's parents-in-law is on the other side of the border, and he obviously has several close relatives living there. That apart, Pranab babu has earned this goodwill by sheer hard work and undivided attention to the well-being of Bangladesh in redressing issues pertaining to Indo-Bangladesh relations. His contribution can be called phenomenal in major contentious issues concerning India and Bangladesh. The veteran Congress leader held several ministerial portfolios in the government of India - external affairs, finance, defence etc. That notwithstanding, he never took his eyes off the happenings in Bangladesh and always used his good offices, in all seriousness, and on all occasions requiring effective intervention. Right from Bangladesh's independence war in 1971, Pranab babu has always been proactive and lending help whenever required - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return from imprisonment, his installation as the prime minister, the tragic assassination and the trail of sensational developments impinging on India’s geo-political landscape due to rise in power of pro-Pakistani, Right reactionary forces who usurped power by facilitating a military coup and exterminating Mujib. It’s is believed Mukherjee proved to be a sheet anchor to the bereaved family of Sheikh Mujib at the time of grief and stood as a great pillar of strength to them. He was also the bridge between the family members and former Indian PM Indira Gandhi, comprehending and reacting to the events unfolding in Dhaka . The bloody coup was followed by counter-coups that took a huge toll and pushed Bangladesh into a turbulent time. Successive regimes, imposition of martial law, general Hussain Mohammad Ershad's rise and Ziaur Rahman's assassination were hallmarks of Bangladesh contemporary history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The man who held the hand of the distressed nation and at the same time took into account India’s security interests, is none other than Mukherjee. Although Sheikh Hasina (in her earlier stint) eventually came to power and was voted out after five years, Pranab Mukherjee maintained good relations with all and helped solve age-old problems of water-sharing and the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs ) accord that facilitated the return thousands of Chakma refugees to Bangladesh. In brief, whenever Bangladesh ran into rough weather, Mukherjee steadied the ship and things remained on course keeping Indo-Bangla relations intact. Interestingly, opposition leaders in Bangladesh too have immense respect for Mukherjee and acknowledge his vision and hold over the nuances of Bangladeshi politics. Mukherjee will be in Bangladesh to attend a number of programmes, including the closing session of the \"International Bengali Literature Conference\". According to   news report, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina \"will inaugurate the three-day literature conference on Saturday (January 13) at Bangla Academy, while Mukherjee will be present at the closing ceremony of the conference on Monday (January 15), as the chief guest\". He will also be flown in to Chittagong on January 15 to be honoured with a D Litt degree by the Chittagong University. In Chittagong , Mukherjee is also expected to be accorded a civic reception. On his part, Mukherjee will present a cheque on behalf of the Indian high commissioner to the Preetilata Trust in furtherance of its activities . Significantly , Mukherjee will also visit the memorial of Surya Sen aka Masterda, the famous revolutionary, known for the Chittagong armoury case. In Dhaka, he is scheduled to deliver the convocation address at the East West University and the Nikhil Bongo Sahitya Sammelan. So far, no meetings have been fixed with any political leaders. It’s assessed that abundant caution is being exercised so as to keep Mukherjee away from any political event, lest it is wrongly interpreted since the general elections in Bangladesh are due at the end of 2018 or early next year. On the whole, the visit is likely to go a long way in reinforcing ties between India and Bangladesh ensuring that at least there is one immediate neighbour who can be relied upon and vice-versa. His presence on the Bangladeshi soil will also encourage secular and pro-liberation forces to rally around Sheikh Hasina, which in effect, will help neutralise communal and divisive forces.  ","title":"Why Dhaka is gearing up to greet Pranab Mukherjee","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-bangladesh-visit-india-bangladesh-ties-sheikh-hasina/story/1/21725.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15323},{"author":"Nooreen Sarna","content":"When four of the   of the Supreme Court decide to hold a press conference to discuss internal disagreements, as they did on the morning of January 12, one   it was not an easy decision to make. One   that it was made under advisement and not carelessly or hurriedly. And one wonders how a schism of this magnitude can heal itself, without the independence of the institution being compromised, and in the absence of any rules or conventions to address factionalism in a collegium. The need for transparency in the functioning of the higher judiciary cannot be emphasised enough. The institution, while entirely unelected, wields a disproportionate amount of power. Constitutional amendments carrying the approval of Parliament and a majority of the state legislatures can turn to dust in the Supreme Court. Additionally, its members are (almost) uniquely difficult to remove from their posts; the process of impeachment being complicated, time-consuming and highly political. The   held at justice J Chelameswar’s house brought to the fore certain questions about the judiciary’s relationship with transparency in its functioning. First, why are there no internal safeguards to deal with administrative issues in the functioning of the Supreme Court? The fact that discussions among the five senior-most judges repeatedly failed, and that a press conference was held out of frustration rather than convention, highlights a lack of structure in the administrative functioning of the Supreme Court. It seems as though there are no intermediate steps to settle administrative or even disciplinary issues in our multi-tiered judiciary. In the higher judiciary, transfers on disciplinary grounds are not common and, naturally, at the Supreme Court, this is not an option. The remote threat of impeachment is the only way to correct or direct judicial conduct. However, impeaching proceedings cannot be instituted by other judges of the Supreme Court and can hardly be termed as remedial in nature.   For an institution considered to be self-governing and supreme, we find that, in situations of internal conflict, there is no structure for internal solutions, and recourse to the media and, possibly, political bodies becomes inevitable. Second, how do we trust that other decisions of this collegium have been made on objective grounds? The Supreme Court has 25 judges currently. Two appointments have already been made by this very collegium,  this past week, and more appointments may well follow here and for the High Courts. In the absence of a truly transparent appointment process, we cannot be certain that voting will not take place according to other prejudices and that the voting pattern won’t reflect other divisions. This is not to question the integrity of the four judges at the press conference (who constitute a majority of the collegium), but rather to say that dangerous conclusions are left to be drawn in the absence of public information available about the functioning of the collegium. And third, will we only see transparency in times of dissent? Is the judiciary picking and choosing when to be transparent? There must be transparency in administrative functioning of the Supreme Court, including in issues of allocation of matters to certain benches. This transparency should not be brought in only when there is a disagreement among the judges - it makes it akin to a kind of whistle-blowing, wholly dependent on the conscience and state of mind of the whistle-blower. This is not to say that there was no good reason to address the public about the deadlock in administrative functioning in the Supreme Court. For a body like the judiciary and the role it plays in our democracy, a show of transparency cannot and should not be sporadic. It should not open itself up to allegations of being motivated. Any efforts made at introducing transparency should be capable of serving as lasting precedents.","title":"Supreme Court judges' revolt: Hard-hitting questions for Indian judiciary","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent/story/1/21713.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15324},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"A lot needs to be said about the historic day when four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court on January 12  of democracy - the media - to convey that the third pillar - the judiciary - is currently facing immense threat. The only time India faced such a crisis was during the Emergency. As the legal reporter for India Today TV, I have been asked by many people about what led to the day's events. How did things come to a head? And where will this lead to in the coming times? I will try and answer them in this piece: It's true that in the past few months, the judicial corridors have been abuzz about how power is increasingly being concentrated with the CJI court and the manner in which the administrative powers are exercised by the CJI. About hundred cases are listed before the CJI on any given day. Many judges have spoken about this in hushed tones, on how it is improper for the CJI to overturn the orders of the other benches because there is no intra court appeal in the Supreme Court. As someone who spends every day at the Supreme Court to report stories, I will admit, I have felt inhibited bringing to light some of these issues which need to be discussed in the open. The order of two-judge bench cannot be overturned by a three-judge bench unless the two-judge bench has referred the matter to a larger bench. These are some of the grievances which have been criticised. The issue of impropriety, however, is more serious: It is repeatedly pointed in the seven-page letter circulated by the judges on Friday that the way the CJI exercises his \"administrative powers\" is arbitrary. This phrase needs to be broken down and looked at. Administrative powers in the Supreme Court means how cases are allocated to benches. It's extremely crucial that the matters are allocated according to the roster and not haphazardly. The allegation made implies that the CJI is not following the rules and is allocating matters to a particular bench to get a predictable outcome. A crucial unsaid truth about the judiciary is that journalists and lawyers can always get a sense of the mood and inclination of judges. Political leanings of judges, if any, are also widely spoken of, off the record. These things can't be said on public fora. A social closeness to a political person does not necessarily mean that the judge is not being objective while handling a case. But it is very important for the fate of the case as to in front of which bench it is listed. It is a crucial aspect in the process of deliverance of justice. It is not merely administrative in nature. What led to the happenings of January 12 go back to events of November 10, 2017 when the seeds of the dissent were sown. It was the day when the CJI  of Justice Chelameswar to refer the MCI scam to the bench of top five judges. An ugly scene broke out in the Supreme Court, with Prashant Bhushan openly alleging that the CJI was involved in corruption. An angry Bhushan walked out of the court when he wasn't allowed to speak. An order was passed by the CJI bench reasserting that the Chief Justice of India is the master of the roster. Even to this day, sources say, justice Lokur and other judges of the Supreme Court met justice Chelameswar. Some statement was expected on that day too, however, the steam seemed to have fizzled out. A few days later, the plea was referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. He was given this matter despite the fact that he was part of the five-judge bench which overturned the order of justice Chelameswar. Justice Misra was   about the conduct of Prashant Bhushan. Some argued that the matter should have been referred to another bench in the spirit of fairness. As expected, justice Arun Mishra dismissed the plea of Prashant Bhushan and severely criticised his conduct. In a related petition, Rs 25 lakh was also imposed on Bhushan. The matter was settled then, but a hurricane began to brew. Then came the plea seeking investigation into the allegedly mysterious death of judge BH Loya, who was presiding over the CBI court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. The matter was again referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. One of the petitioners in the Loya case came to me and informed that a senior lawyer backed out from the case by saying nothing was going to happen in the matter. It was during this conversation at 11.10am that a source informed me of the press conference. Interestingly, while the press conference was taking place, the CJI court around 12 noon was informed of the developments. A whistle was sounded in the CJI court and the guards rushed in to escort the CJI out of the courtroom. The timing of this entire incident cannot be overlooked. The press conference took place during the working hours of the Supreme Court and the CJI had no clue about this development. The top four judges of the Supreme Court rose up at around 11am and headed to the residence of Justice Chelameswar. Many legal experts today sound surprised with the developments of the day. They seem to have missed the frustration and the discontent brewing in the power corridors of the judiciary. The push and pull of the collegium is not something new. But when top four judges of the Supreme Court see no recourse but to address the media, we are indeed in for troubled times. The disenchantment with the way top court is functioning is deep and pervasive. The underlying current is the interference of the executive with the judiciary. When top judges of the Supreme Court say that democracy is under threat, we must take it seriously. When media shy judges are compelled to address a mob of press and speak openly, imagine the discontent and the helplessness festering within. The day shall go down in history when a clarion call was made for change and accountability. How it impacts the CJI and Parliament, the people of the country have a right to know and want an accountable judiciary.","title":"Why rebellion at Supreme Court was in the offing","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent-justice-loya-mci-scam/story/1/21716.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15325},{"author":"Shantanu Mukharji","content":"With the advent of the new year, a group of office-bearers believed to be representing more than a dozen gurdwaras in the Canadian province of  , have jointly decided to ban officials representing India, its diplomats and others from entering the premises of the Sikh temples. The decision was taken at Gurdwara Jot Parkash Sahib in Brampton on December 30. Significantly, the pro forma statement mentioned “pursuant to the trespass to the Property Act (1990), the management of the Gurdwara Sahib reserves the right to ban entry to officials of the Indian government including but not limited to Indian elected officials , Indian consular officials and members of organisations who seek to undermine the Sikh nation and Sikh institution ( )\". The statement further stated: “Keeping in mind the interference of Indian consular and Indian government officials in the lives of Canadian Sikhs, gurdwara management committees have jointly taken the decision to bar the entry of these officials and members from gurdwaras across Canada. The presence of these officials makes members of the Sikh community uncomfortable due to their agenda of undermining the autonomy of Sikh institutions and organisations. It is our obligation to ensure the safety of the 'Sangat'.\" However, the statement clarified that the ban will be only on those visiting gurdwaras in their official capacity, not if they come in personal capacity. Meanwhile, pro-separatist activists, including Sukhminder Singh Hansra, have welcomed the decision alleging that officials were directly infiltrating into the Sikh affairs in Canada. This development is very  and, unless remedial measures are not taken without further delay, may give boost to the Khalistani movement, already brewing in the West. Examining the statements issued by the Sikh entities, it's difficult to miss the disturbing trend. When they say that the presence of Indian government officials tend to undermine the autonomy of the Sikhs and make them uncomfortable, it’s difficult to assess as to which factors are responsible to make the Indian officials’ presence uncomfortable. This appears to give a clear signal to the government to keep off the Sikh affairs which are interpreted to be the exclusive privilege of the Sikh clerical organisations. Gurdwaras have been rendering great service not only to the Sikhs, but to the world at large and the Indian community in particular in foreign countries. So what went wrong? Is it a growing distance between Indian diplomatic missions and Sikh shrines? This gap must be bridged sooner than later. It’s possible that a certain segment of the alienated Sikhs are discontented as their names continue to figure in the \"blacklist\" of the consular wing for their alleged acts in Punjab thought to be anti-national. If such suspicions are true, it’s time to revisit the names afresh. In today’s world of global uncertainties, no group can be insulated from the national mainstream. A healing touch is perhaps called for. Any tough measure is likely to be met with equally tough reaction which may be counterproductive. Coincidentally, barely 14 days after the Canadian notifications, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast (SCCEC) and America Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (APGC) stated that 96 gurdwaras have decided to ban entry of Indian officials. The ban would also hold good to Nagar Kirtans or religious processions. American Sikh entities following suit to the Canadian decisions, make the situation a little more complex. And if such bans catch on to other parts of the world, then a major fire fighting exercise seems called for before it gets out of hand. This also calls for caution as the SCCEC and the AGPC combine is the largest umbrella organisation of the Sikhs in the US. It is further known that the decision has been reached with the support of US-based Sikh group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). In order to enforce their diktat, the Sikh bodies have also threatened to initiate legal proceedings against those Indian diplomats trying to breach the ban. On its part, any state, or in this case the government of India, cannot remain oblivious to the designs of the separatists to go on a propaganda offensive espousing their so-called cause. It has to come down heavily on the elements, now on a collision course, supporting the Khalistan movement. Having said this, it’s equally important to assuage the genuine grievances, if any, of those Sikhs who are provoked to resort to such a drastic course of action. It seems all Sikhs in Canada and in the US do not support the latest move to ban the entry of the Indian officials. If not for the active cooperation from the gurdwaras, it wouldn’t have been possible for the government of India to contain the Khalistani movement, at its peak in the 1990s. Both the gurdwaras and the high commissions/embassies had excellent relationships, churning out best possible results for the Sikhs and the Indian government representatives. The late Naresh Chandra, former US ambassador, appropriated best of collaboration with the gurdwara forces bringing in much-needed peace. There are multiple names in this regard who accomplished the task with dexterity and patience. Both the Canadian and US statements have a thrust in banning the consular officers. Probably that’s where it hurts most because it extends services to passport and visa services. If they are attended to on a case-to-case and genuine basis, more than half the problem is solved. Consular staff, therefore, perhaps needs to be more caring, sensitive and patient to assuage the disgruntlement. Presently, the Indian ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, is a Sikh and a seasoned diplomat. His officers manning the different consulates also carry huge experience and acumen. Similarly, India's high commissioner to Canada, Vikas Swarup, is most articulate and experienced in public and media dealings. They can walk the extra mile to prevail upon the Sikh bodies to rescind their orders in the larger interest of the country’s peace and sovereignty. Equally important is to pre-empt any probable evil design by the Pakistani forces, especially the ISI, unleashed to encourage the Khalistani forces. Frustrated by its self-aborted designs of Khalistani propaganda for the last so many years, Pakistani agencies may be attempting to stir yet another move to pinprick our security interests. Such a move must be averted for good, as time is running out.","title":"Why gurdwaras in Canada and US banned the entry of Indian officials","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sikh-gurdwaras-canada-ontario-ban-indian-officials-khalistani-movement-pakistan/story/1/21705.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15326},{"author":"Mohammad Behzad Fatmi","content":"Under the ongoing state of emergency, Turkey has issued yet another controversial   on December 24, 2017, granting immunity to civilians who were part of the mobs which suppressed the 2016 failed coup attempt against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Authorities say such a measure was necessary to protect those civilians who risked their lives to shield their elected government - on the night of July 15 and the early hours of July 16, 2016 - from putschists. But the decree is so vaguely worded that it is possible for one to interpret it as granting immunity from prosecution for actions that one may have taken post-July 15 or may take in the future against a government critic on the pretext of suppressing the continuation of events on the night of the coup.  Regardless of its gravity and profound detrimental effect on the rule of law in the country, such a step by the AKP government hardly took anyone by surprise. Over the past couple of years, there have been multiple   of the AKP government establishing private militias loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. One of the such prominent groups is   which allegedly had dozens of its men armed with semi-automatic rifles on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, assaulting and killing many of the renegade soldiers on the night of July 15, 2016. Interestingly, SADAT also stands accused of killing a number of innocent civilians on that fateful night in order to boost public anger and help the government create a victim narrative. The newly issued decree practically means that not only SADAT and a number of other shadowy outfits like it will not be punished for these crimes, but they will also not be brought to justice should they take law in their own hands in the future, in circumstances they argue were similar to that of July 15, 2016. This move has led many to believe that the government is preparing for an imminent clash between President Erdogan’s Islamist and Dogu Perincek’s ultranationalist camp who despite being contemptuous of each other formed an alliance in the aftermath of the coup attempt to purge state institutions of pro-western officials. Dogu Perincek was jailed in 2008 during the Ergenekon trials for plotting to overthrow the AKP government, but his conviction was   in 2014 when Erdogan started to target the Movement of Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. On stepping out of the prison complex he talked to the media waiting for him and   that he will dismantle the “regime of Tayyip Erdogans, Abdullah Guls, Fethullah Gulens”, referring to the perceived alliance between the AKP and the US-based cleric. Since then Perincek has been back in business growing the influence of his tiny far-left Patriotic Party on important state institutions, especially on the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK). The “Perincek group”, as the ultranationalist pro-Russian companions of Dogu Perincek are often referred to in the Turkish policy chattering circle, has been the biggest   of the massive purge of pro-Western officials from the TSK following the coup attempt in 2016. The meteoric growth in influence of an ultranationalist group which has always despised the Islamist-rooted AKP poses an existential threat to the Erdogan regime - and Erdogan knows it very well. On the other hand, many analysts see this move as Erdogan’s preparation for another “false flag operation” which will justify crackdown on the remaining few voices of dissent in the country - the way the July 15 events justified suppression of the Gulen Movement. Even though there is no effective opposition in the country, there are still pockets of resistance and/or potential rivals which Erdogan would like to neutralise. The likes of former president Abdullah Gul, a few defiant MPs from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), and of course the Perincek group are certainly not the type of forces Erdogan wants to accommodate in his vision of a totalitarian regime in Turkey. Regardless of whether Erdogan had the former or the later motive in his mind while drafting this decree, the situation that it may lead to cannot be peace and order - which Turkey needs desperately. It will certainly push the country towards chaos and instability, perhaps even towards a civil war.  ","title":"Is Turkey heading towards a civil war?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/turkey-controversial-decree-coup-attempt-racep-tayyip-erdogan-civil-war/story/1/21677.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15327},{"author":"Majid Hyderi","content":"There is still hope, but only for some. In the past six months, two verdicts from the apex court on two separate pleas seeking fresh probe - into the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and the killings of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s and early 2000s - have drawn massive comparisons. On January 10, the   decided to set up a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to look into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases in 1984, investigations into which were closed earlier. The apex court has also asked the Centre to suggest names for the proposed three-member panel, which will be headed by a former high court judge. The 1984 riots, which broke out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had claimed the lives of an estimated 8,000 people in Delhi and around the country. But then, if riots dating back to 1980s can be reinvestigated through an SIT, why is it declared “too late” for fresh investigations into the killings of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s? In July 2017, the apex court rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking fresh probe into the killing of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir. Dismissing the PIL filed by an NGO “Roots in Kashmir”, the apex court said it would be difficult to probe as evidence “is unlikely to be available”. \"Almost 27 years have gone by… Where will the evidence will come from? Such a plea should have been moved long time ago,\" the   had observed. The petitioners had moved the court saying that they need a \"sense of justice\" in the case. \"The community has legitimate expectations. The successive governments have repeatedly made fake promises that the Pandits could return (to homeland). No one is protecting them,\" they prayed. The dismissal of the case buried all hopes for justice for the survivors of the systematic bloodbath. Apart from the outraged Pandit community, even a human rights group - largely run by Kashmiri Muslims - had sharply reacted to the court decision. The Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society in a statement had  : \"The Supreme Court order is a complete departure from established law that ‘crime never dies’, and there exists no time limitation for justice under Indian and international law with regard to serious crimes such as murder.\" The rights group observed that “killings of Kashmiri Pandits, other minorities and all violence in Jammu and Kashmir have never been fairly and credibly investigated”, adding, “Thus far, Jammu and Kashmir has faced widespread, systemic violence, largely at the hands of the Indian state.” Three decades on, the killings of Pandits, continue to be an unsolved mystery. For the all-resourceful government, it took around two decades to just consolidate contradictory figures of the killings. As per a first comprehensive report compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 2008, from 1989 onwards, 209 Kashmiri Pandits were killed. As many as 109 killed in 1990 alone. According to this   in , while 140 cases were registered at police stations across Kashmir, chargesheets had been filed in only 24 cases. In 115 cases, the perpetrators are yet to be identified. Even the first reported killing of a Kashmiri Pandit remains unsolved. According to the police, the first Pandit to be killed was a woman named Prabhavati from Budgam. She was killed in Srinagar on March 14, 1989, by unidentified gunmen, whose identity could never be established. Of all the districts of Kashmir province, the summer capital of Srinagar, as per the police records, had witnessed the largest number of killings  - 82 - within two years of the onset of the armed insurgency. Apart from individual target killings, in some instances, the minority community people were massacred. These include the Sangrampora massacre in which seven persons were killed during on the night of March 21-22 in 1997 in Budgam, 23 were killed in Wandhama on January 25, 1998 and 24  murdered in Nadimarg on March 24, 2003. According to the police, the perpetrators of the Wandhama massacre remain untraced. There are slight contradictions even in the official figures pertaining to the killings. In March 2010, the then government told the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that 219 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed by militants since 1989, , and not 209,  as previously reported by the police. But a year later in 2011, the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a Srinagar-based organisation, said at least 399 Pandits had been killed. There cannot be a bigger pain than the exodus of the bereaved community out of their homeland. And this wound has been festering in the absence of a fair probe, something which could clear the air and lead to the severest punishment for the perpetrators. It could equally contribute in reconciliatory efforts aimed at harmonious return of the Pandits to their homeland. If investigations into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases were closed without investigation, probe into killings of Pandits never took off. For the Sikh community, it has been an unfortunate case of justice delayed (even as the latest Supreme Court decision revived fresh hopes), but for the Pandits,  it remains yet another grievous instance of justice denied.","title":"If 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms can be reopened, why not Kashmiri Pandit killings?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sit-probe-kashmiri-pandits-exodus-supreme-court-justice-delayed-denied/story/1/21666.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15328},{"author":"Hriday Ranjan","content":"Every time an actor announces the decision to join politics, my curiosity is piqued. We are a nation that worships stars. But when it comes to elections, we show them the ballot finger. Since the ‘50s, film stars in India have, without hesitation, hopped on to the next, logical platform: politics. According to a   entry, India has three times the number of actor-politicians than most countries, followed only by USA and Philippines (I wonder what’s happening there!). Election results for actors have been far from blockbusting. Indian film stars have realised the bitter truth that winning votes is a lot tougher than bashing up villains. In fact, Sunil Dutt might be the only major film star who had a long, successful political career — winning five terms and also serving as Union minister for youth affairs and sports in the UPA government. Govinda did nothing of remote importance as a politician; the highlight of his political career being the moment when he begged Sonia Gandhi to become the prime minister — much like the climax of a certain David Dhawan-Kader Khan film. Hema Malini’s political career has been as spectacular as her daughter Esha Deol’s film career — with reports of villagers protesting outside her office since they saw zero development under the Dream Girl’s leadership. Hemaji is now seen as a representative for Kent RO. Actress Jayaprada’s career started with the Telugu Desam Party in undivided Andhra Pradesh; she then switched to Samajwadi Party in UP, and finally launched her own party. Chiranjeevi, the Telugu megastar, too, started his own party in 2008. In 2011, in a move that would give Chanakya a stroke, he merged it with the Congress. And then there’s the murky history  Amitabh Bachchan and late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors scam. It is not only film actors who have dipped their fingers in the hot oil of politics. TV actors, too, have tried their luck. Smriti Irani is a success story, but other TV actors have found less success. Actors who essayed the roles of Ram, Krishna, Draupadi and Ravan (!) in mythological shows have contested elections in India. Shekhar Suman joined the Congress, lost an election, and returned to TV. Rakhi Sawant launched her own party targeted at the ordinary citizen, called Rashtriya Aam Party. So absurd is the association of stars with politics that Salman Khan has campaigned for both BJP and Congress. Bhai has gone so far as to campaign for the Sri Lankan president. Why?  Many actors such as Amitabh Bachhan and Govinda have gracefully resigned from politics, whereas the other have faced defeat, or been invited as Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. Barring Kerala, every Indian state has had actors chancing their luck in politics. Overall, the success rate of film stars in politics has been — to put it accurately — like Fardeen Khan’s career. However, this is only true in the northern parts of India. Down South, film stars have had blockbuster careers as politicians. People from north India are often baffled at the sycophancy surrounding film stars in Tamil Nadu, and attribute it to emotional overtures. It could be driven by emotion – like the temples built for actresses Khushboo and Namitha suggest. But politics is deeply intertwined with cinema in Tamil Nadu. The three largest political icons in Tamil Nadu are film stars — MG Ramachandran (actor), Karunanidhi (screenwriter) and Jayalalitha (actor). In undivided Andhra Pradesh, then megastar NT Rama Rao founded the Telugu Desam Party and became the chief minister of the state. In December 2017, Rajinikanth announced that he will contest the next Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In many ways, Tamil Nadu politics is starkly different from politics in any other part of the country. Thalaiva’s decision to bring about “spiritual politics” might have raised eyebrows in any other part of the country, but in Tamil Nadu, nobody batted an eyelid. The contribution of film stars to Tamil consciousness is rooted in the philosophies of Periyar and the self-respect movement. The state has a high Human Development Index (HDI) score when it comes to parametres like primary education and healthcare. In a nation that is slanting dangerously close to religion year after year, Tamil Nadu’s Dravidian politics has washed its hands of religion and caste. In fact, Tamil Nadu’s leaders are proud and fierce atheists — from Karunanidhi to Kamal Haasan. Thalaiva has his work cut out. Like in the film   Thalaiva is entering an arena with two established players — the AIADMK and the DMK;  Yet, Rajinikanth is not your average film star getting into politics. He is said to have 55,000 fan clubs in the state, besides a diasporic network of fans. There are legendary stories of his humility, and his unique tradition of returning distributors’ money for films that tank at the box office. In a state that has largely fulfilled its basic needs, Rajinikanth needs to deliver something else this time: faith. But as Thalaiva himself says in   “Once I take up a job, I don’t leave it without completing it... and I don’t take up a job that I can't complete.” Rajini can.","title":"Why Rajinikanth joining politics is perfect","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-tamil-nadu-politics-lok-sabha-polls-2019/story/1/21673.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15329},{"author":"Harmeet Shah Singh","content":"Uncovering secrets in an ecosystem as complex as India's is replete with monumental challenges. One came out last week when   newspaper reported that personal details of citizens could be bought for as little as Rs 500 via WhatsApp. Rachna Khaira, the journalist who broke the story, explained how unknown agents were able to provide access to names, addresses, photos and email aliases from what is advertised as Aadhaar's impregnable database. Her report compounded concerns over the security of the citizens' privileged details at a time when risks of identity fraud have mounted the world over. For cyber criminals, personal information is a gateway to potential scams. Khaira's report was expected to stimulate the UIDAI to generate an environment of confidence and safety when   has been declared a fundamental right. It didn't, unfortunately. Instead, the UIDAI went on a power trip. It filed a police complaint against the reporter and her newspaper among others. Its action rhymed with what is now a pervasive trend to spin unpalatable news reports, no matter how vital they might be to public interest. Investigative journalism is a great public service. As an editor of India Today TV's Special Investigation Team, I can say with conviction that investigative reports stand tall when political stories dominate regular television rundowns and fake news floats freely on social media. This form of journalism is centred on firm impact and not around TV ratings or digital hits. It sets a stellar example of agenda-setting reporting. India Today's enterprising SIT cadre has itself revealed massive scandals, underground economy, organised gangs, education scams, child labour, medical frauds, terror financing and a lot more over the past one year. These journalists have mostly gone undercover to their subjects — and caught them confessing to wrongdoings on hidden cameras. Had it not been for the SIT's exposé of a widespread   in Bihar, India simply wouldn't know about the scale of malpractices inside the state's educational institutions. Its startling reporting on the business of toxic hospital waste brought to light some of the worst forms of environmental and child labour. Our SIT busted black-money mafias across a variety of sectors in the wake of demonetisation. And when this Special Investigation Team broke a mega-exclusive on the Pakistani funding of the Hurriyat in Jammu and Kashmir last year, multiple government agencies swung into action in multiple states. The story set national news agenda for weeks that followed. What drives these courageous investigations is a mission to serve the people's right to information. But now imagine a situation when an investigative reporter is intimidated by the threat of trial for impersonation and cheating. It would suffocate the entire genre of investigative journalism. Remember, undercover reporting is a technique investigative journalists adopt widely across the world in order to get access that would otherwise be declined. They would pose as businesspersons, sport agents, financiers, patients, middlemen and so forth with a sole goal to get the information out for the larger public interest. But what has happened over the first weekend of 2018 is a vicious kick in the teeth of investigative journalism itself. In the world's largest democracy, journalist Rachna Khaira is charged under the IPC's sections related to impersonation, cheating and forgery for exposing glaring holes in the UIDAI's privacy-protection armour. Instead of putting its house in order, the UIDAI has tried to shoot the messenger down. But it's not all doom and gloom. For now, India's media fraternity has stood united against this spiteful tactic to suppress stories that hold power to account. But let's not stop here. Let this campaign be sustained in order to preserve, nourish and protect investigative journalism — that insatiable quest for the realities of power in the face of powerful opposition.","title":"Why UIDAI's FIR against The Tribune journalist is a kick in the teeth of investigative journalism","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uidai-fir-aadhaar-data-breach-mass-surveillance-investigative-journalism/story/1/21632.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15330},{"author":"Javed Anwer","content":"Aadhaar didn't start as surveillance technology. While the concept of a unique ID for all was fuzzy even in the beginning — around 2009 — it was meant to be an authentication technology that would plug leaks in India's welfare schemes. The idea behind Aadhaar seemed well-meaning, but the way it was designed and hurriedly pushed made it evident to keen observers that it was not going to end up well. There were many problems with it, but of particular note was the way Aadhaar would give the government and bureaucrats unnecessary power over individual citizens. Instead of being a tool of inclusion, Aadhaar would be a tool of exclusion. Even in the early stages, it was difficult to imagine that one day the Aadhaar would turn into Frankenstein's monster. In 2018, it has become a tool that has the potential to put every citizen in this country under surveillance. The argument that Aadhaar is a tool to end corruption in India surfaced earlier this decade. After 2012, and exceedingly after 2014, Aadhaar grew in ways it was not meant to when it was conceived. This has happened as the UIDAI — the agency in charge of the Aadhaar programme — acquired unaccountable power over the people of India, and made its operations as secretive and opaque as it can. Fun fact 1: Do you know that under Aadhaar Act 2016, the UIDAI has virtually no accountability, but has provisions that stop Aadhaar users, that is ordinary Indians, from filing any complaint against it in court for the misuse of the UID? Fun fact 2: Do you know Aadhaar was never meant to be an ID card? In the initial days, Aadhaar was linked to government's welfare schemes. For instance, it was made mandatory for issuing ration to all those who held a ration card. This despite the fact that the Supreme Court, in its interim order, told the government that having the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory in any way. Post-2015, all hell broke loose. By now, Aadhaar is no longer just technology to authenticate the identity of those entitled to benefits under government welfare schemes. It transformed into an authentication technology for almost everything Indians do. In 2018, if you go by the directives issued by the government, you have to link your Aadhaar to almost everything you own or do. Aadhaar is no longer required only for welfare schemes, like obtaining a ration card, but also if you want to continue using your phone. It is “required”, although not yet mandatory, for availing banking services until March 31 because Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to it. Aadhaar is required for registering births in many parts of India, and even deaths. Aadhaar is required if you want an LPG connection, even if you don't intend to take subsidies. And Aadhaar is required if you want to send your children to school or if you want your degree, and for treatment at many hospitals — even if you are an accident victim and are brought to the emergency with severe head trauma! This is just the beginning. If the Supreme Court dismisses the current challenge to link Aadhaar with every aspect of our lives, be ready to see more Aadhaar in your life. Even simple tasks like buying airline tickets or making hotel reservations or renting homes will soon necessitate Aadhaar authentication. It is important to understand why Aadhaar has become so pervasive. By linking the UID with children’s admissions in private schools, or by linking it with private data, such as your phone number, the government is not saving any money. It is not curbing or cracking down on corruption. It is just putting in place an infrastructure: arguably the world's biggest surveillance apparatus that a country has built to keep an eye on its citizens. Sure, the United States’ NSA will still be bigger, but then NSA for now watches only non-Americans. In the recent years, Aadhaar has metamorphosed into the perfect surveillance tool. It allows the government to collect and record every piece of data that Indians generate as they go about their lives. By storing this data in one place, with Aadhaar as its key, the government will be able to theoretically track and build profiles of every Indian with the UID. There is the argument that we already leave a digital trail whenever we use a phone, carry out a banking transaction, book an air or train ticket or get an LPG connection, and so it doesn't matter that Aadhaar is linked with the service. That is true. But by linking every detail of our existence with Aadhaar, the government puts all of this data in one place and makes it incredibly easy to monitor, record and use. Across the world, governments seek to gain more control over citizens. When they have achieved some level of control, they also abuse it, as history tells us. Even if the original intent is benign, never in the history has a government built surveillance apparatus and not abused it. If we allow Aadhaar to grow unchecked, controlled and managed by an agency with no accountability — and it is the UIDAI that filed an FIR to go after people who pointed out Aadhaar flaws — the results are not going to be pretty. PS: The headline of this article has been taken from a tweet often used by some Indian Twitter users to highlight the perils of Aadhaar.

The Gayoom government would be sending its foreign minister Mohamed Asim and defence minister Adam Shareef to India later this month. The proposed dates of Asim and Shareef's visit are January 11 and January 16, respectively. The two visits would be important events for the India-Maldives bilateral relations and a major diplomatic bid by the Gayoom government to build bridges with India after a series of unsavoury episodes. Currently, the India-Maldives relations are frigid on account of a host of incidents in the recent past such as Maldives signing its first-ever Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China despite its avowed \"India-first\" policy, the Maldivian media owing allegiance to President Gayoom severely criticising India in general and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, and restricting Indian envoy Akhilesh Mishra's movements in Maldives. President Gayoom is dispatching his foreign and defence ministers to India in a last-ditch effort to mollify India, greatly hurt by a series of provocations from Maldives, some of which have been mentioned above. Though these ministers would obviously be meeting their Indian counterparts, Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman, their main agenda would be to meet the big man himself, PM Modi. The course the relationship between the two countries takes would all depend on whether Modi is willing to meet the two senior Maldivian ministers. If he does so, it would be construed as a big concession from India and denote that the Modi government is willing to forgive and forget. But as of now the indications are that Modi won't give them an appointment, citing his busy schedule considering that the budget session of Parliament is scheduled to begin from January 29, with the tabling of the Economic Survey. The MEA has confirmed that the Maldivian foreign minister will be calling on PM Modi on January 11 evening. Significantly, Maldives happens to be the only neighbouring country which Modi hasn't visited. He was scheduled to visit the country in March 2015 but cancelled the trip at the last minute after the Gayoom government arrested former president Mohammed Nasheed, a friend of India, under trumped up charges of terrorism and sedition. Since then, India-Maldives relations have been strained. What has greatly upset the Modi government is that the Maldivian media known to be have allegiance with President Gayoom, has criticised PM Modi for his pro-Hindu politics and called him names. Maldives, a tiny nation with a population of just about 4 lakh people (in contrast Delhi's Karol Bagh has a population of over 5 lakh), is a hundred per cent Muslim nation. The   is watching the developments closely and doesn't want Modi to meet the Maldivian ministers. India would be giving a mouthful to the visiting Maldivian ministers over the issues mentioned above and would like to know what concrete actions the Gayoom government has taken or proposes to take in the near future to take care of Indian interests and sensitivities. For example, India would like to see reversal of some India-centric policies that the Gayoom government has implemented over past few weeks. India would like to have a firm commitment from Maldives that it wouldn't unleash its media to poke India in the eye. Some of the statements from Gayoom himself have muddied the waters. Gayoom has of late made several remarks at his public functions wherein he has castigated India without naming the country. The Indian position is that that such remarks, coming from the head of the government, have been too harsh and detrimental to the larger cause of good relations between the two SAARC member states. India would also like to have a commitment from the Gayoom government to have an inclusive domestic policy wherein the Opposition is taken on board, not victimised and repressed as is the trend. India would like to have an assurance that Maldives won't do anything to gag democracy and accord due space to the Opposition given the Maldivian presidential election are due in about eight months. The biggest talking point of India will be to convey a message that Maldives shouldn't play the China card in its dealings with India, something which another SAARC nation Nepal has been doing for decades. While India cannot tell Maldives not to have close relations with any foreign power, including China, New Delhi would be making it clear that Maldives would be playing the China versus India strategic game at its own peril. India is quite upset over the fact that while its envoy in Maldives Akhilesh Mishra is having his movements severely restricted, the Chinese ambassador is being given a special treatment. India is concerned over the manner in which Maldives has on the one hand been wooing China but on the other hand tightening screws on India. Under the Gayoom regime, the Chinese strategic footprints in Maldives have been growing larger and larger while India has continuously been cold-shouldered. The social media trends mirror this situation very well. For example, while workers in Maldives from other countries have been living in shanties, the Chinese have been building plush permanent structures for their workers. But India has its own leverages with regards to Maldives, especially considering the fact that it's much closer to Maldives geographically than powers like China. Also, Gayoom is not unmindful of the Indian leverages. That's why he is sending his ministers on a diplomatic mission. Watch this space.","title":"Why India needs to talk tough with ministers from Maldives","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-maldives-relations-mohammed-nasheed-yameen-abdul-gayoom-sushma-swaraj/story/1/21633.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15332},{"author":"Mrinal Pradhan","content":"The   has been passed by the Lok Sabha. That is a victory for women, democracy, as well as secularism, but not many people see it that way yet. Let us consider the plight of the average woman in the world today, with US President Donald Trump also being charged with sexual assault in a lot of anecdotal references. Let us also consider the plight of the average Muslim in India, and now consider the plight of women in this light. There is no case one can argue in favour of the men, the husbands of the country, with regard to an issue of their wives’ rights, especially in the case of a right that is well known to be necessary for any human being, not just a Muslim woman. In the 1980s, when Rajiv Gandhi interfered in the famous  case, there were protests that the interference was setting up a dangerous precedent. Thirty years later, the politics of polarisation has resulted in a short, but dangerous history of demolitions, riots, burning of trains, and attacks on non-vegetarians. Now that the government in power, which may well have benefited from the said bloody history, is trying to undo the damage, people (mostly men) are protesting against the new law. They cite that it would be contrary to the prescriptive morals of their way of life. And from their point of view, they may even be right. But the fact remains that a large number of women suffer and have suffered due to the obvious disproportionate distribution of rights between men and women when it comes to the subject of breaking marriages. Some would even say that divorce should be outlawed in Hindu societies, which is also symptomatic of the lack of rights women share globally. The other extreme would say that divorce is fine, but that only men have exclusive rights with regard to divorce. How on earth can one justify the ending of a marriage so arbitrarily when even relationships are seemingly impossible to let go of in an arbitrary fashion? The question of the legitimacy of the bill to criminalise triple talaq is not even relevant here. An appeal to one’s most basic shred of a conscience is enough to justify the legitimacy of women’s rights. Have we all disrespected women so strongly for so long that one has to   that women and men should have equal rights to say the least? Whether this new policy and corresponding law of the Hindu-majority government will be beneficial in the practical sphere or not is subject to the tides of time, but the sheer legitimacy of this law is unquestionable in most commonly held views on ethics. The rest is our choice, sociological or ideological. Secularism implies non-interference in social matters pertaining to religion. However, women’s rights along with many other rights ordinarily considered fundamental to democratic societies are more important for the larger sake of secularism itself. How can it be that through non-interference in social laws the government can protect social rights? Interference of any sort in the metaphysical sphere of things in understandable, but Lord Benedict’s arguments for criminalising Sati a few centuries in the past under the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy, one of India’s premier intellectuals, is as valid today as it was then. If one sees exploitation occurring around them, the first reaction should be to interfere, as positively as possible, to curb that exploitation. The BJP government may hold allegations of inhumanity against them, but a step towards egalitarianism is far more human than burning women alive for dowry, arbitrarily breaking marriages which are alleged to be made in heaven, or forcing girls into child labour. The very fact that the Opposition is not opposing this bill severely is enough proof that even our liberally hated politicians of Delhi are synergistically showing signs of reform. When the Congress majority government of the 1950s decided to implement a uniform codification of all personal law with respect to Hindu law, the then right wing had decided to oppose such change. Now, it is believed that the right-wing government in power may be stepping further towards a uniform civil code for all. Uniformity of social policing notwithstanding, the fate of women is an issue in its own right, globally, and should not be denigrated to a low-key fight for communal compartmentalising. Demonetisation may have allegedly been a failure. However, politically it benefitted Modi, on account of the divide that it created between the rich and poor of our nation. Triple Talaq may be a failure in reality, but it has added to the divide between Muslim women and men. If men do not wish for militaristic feminism in the manner of communist militarism between haves and have-nots, they should tread this line further, namely that of the middle path, protecting women rights without allowing rogue elements to twist the debate in their patriarchal favour. Sooner or later, the consciousness of matriarchy shall step in and destroy the absurd injustices of a thousand years. But until then, the men, leaders, minority spokespersons and such should be forewarned. Women are human, as human as our grandfathers who drove out the British, and eventually, an evil establishment fails through its own contradictions.","title":"Triple talaq bill: Is it a social reform or a political weapon?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/triple-talaq-bill-muslim-women-gender-equality-bjp/story/1/21584.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15333},{"author":"Rajeev Dhavan","content":"The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Bill 2017 or the triple talaq bill is a vindictive outcome of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shayara Bano case of last year. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons (SOR), the bill traces its moral authority to fulfil the Supreme Court’s decision that instant divorce (talaq-e-biddat) after three pronouncements was illegal. The SOR says, “The judgment vindicated the position taken by the government that talaq-e-biddat is against Constitutional morality, the dignity of women and principles of gender equity guaranteed under the Constitution.” This, according to the SOR, was in contradistinction to the view of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which wanted to issue advisories. The very wording of the SOR displays a sense of triumph against the Muslim community, a sort of posturing by the government over the Muslim community through the bill. The government’s reading of the Supreme Court judgment is hopelessly misleading. The minority view (of ex CJI JS Khehar and Abdul Nazeer) was that instant talaq is a recognised Islamic practice and it was for the Parliament to intervene if it wanted to. The need for government legislation follows from here. The split majority struck down instant talaq for different reasons. One view was that it was contrary to Islamic law (Kurien), the other that it violated constitutional equality (Nariman–Lalit). The government’s flowery reference to constitutional morality and gender \"equity\" is based on this latter minority view because the second majority judgment simply declared it contrary to Islamic law. The bill emanates from the imagination of the government to (a) showcase Muslim law as unjust and (b) instrument a careless and vindictive law to break up Muslim marriages. Once the court declared instant talaq to be illegal and unconstitutional, the simple declaration in Clause 3 outlawing any form of instant triple talaq was enough: “Any pronouncement of talaq by a person upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever is illegal.” At first blush, Clause 3 gives the broad impression that “talaq” itself is illegal. Of course, “talaq” in the definition clause limits the bill to talaq-ebiddat or all forms of instant talaq. A clever presentation — too clever. But after the SC declaration that instant talaq is illegal, this meant the marriage subsists with all the obligations of Islamic law. Here the bill takes an “ugly turn”. It assumes that although instant talaq is illegal, but with its pronouncement, the marriage itself has broken down requiring remedial action. It gives the right to subsistence allowance and custody of children to the wife similar to divorce proceedings when marriages break up. The bill assumes that the illegal declaration of talaq by the husband virtually breaks up the marriage requiring questions of subsistence allowance to be adjudicated by a Magistrate. In other words, the declaration of instant talaq accelerates a marriage breakdown when the real purpose of the Supreme Court and, supposedly the bill was that the marriage remains alive and well. But the bill regards the very utterance of instant divorce as a kind of breakdown or judicial separation requiring magisterial intervention on maintenance and custody. This is the evil effect of the bill to break the marriage rather than cement it. Why “subsistence allowance”? If instant talaq is illegal, the wife is lawfully wedded with full privileges of a wife. “Subsistence allowance” is a step down — legislative cruelty denying the wife and children total rights. How absurd can this be? A fully wedded wife not legally divorced by her husband will be entitled to only adjudicated subsistence for herself and her children. This part of the bill is antigender, anti-SC judgment, anti-common sense and directed to break up marital relations. The fully wedded wife would run off to a Magistrate for what happens in judicial separation or divorce for relief. Husband and wife are put in legal attrition Finally, the criminality provisions are provocative and irresponsible. Clause 7 means that if the husband utters the instant talaq words, he would commit “an offence which is cognisable and non-bailable”. This means he can be arrested by police and remain in investigative custody unless the Magistrate intervenes. Is this designed to cure the marriage or perpetuate discord? Everything illegal is not a crime. Making it criminal, distorts the relationship between parties. The BJP uses its majority in Lok Sabha to do what it likes. On December 20, 2017, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad answered that after the SC judgment, 99 cases of instant talaq were reported. Is that enough to punish the Muslim community, causing legal quarrels between husband and wife and sending the husband to jail for up to three years. The debate was sparse. The Opposition quiet. So what if they were in a minority, the Opposition should have torn apart the whole bill (not just the penal provisions). In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition put up a fight. But gradually it also caved in — agreeable to compromise on the pen provision not being cognisable and non-bailable. The bill was not passed in the Winter session. But it should be circulated for public opinion or, at least, sent to a select Parliamentary committee as demanded by some members. This is an unfair bill produced by BJP majoritarianism.

He belongs not just to the world of movies, but is part of folklore. He is a metaphor for the miracle we call films. His very entry brought a democratic ease to film. I remember Rajinikanth was a bus conductor. He was once asked by a journalist, “If you had not been a bus conductor-turned-film star, what would you have been?” Quick came the answer, “Oh, a smuggler or a bootlegger.” Rajini was emphasising the fundamental equality of all occupations in the informal economy, from where Kollywood scripts often originate. That was decades ago. When Rajinikanth announced he is going to join politics, start a new political party, the enthusiasm did not work out like the release of his films. The DMK and the AIADMK felt he was not real enough for politics. Many academic activists were even dismissive, arguing that Rajini had taken no real stands in politics. But the problem is a more complex one. Rajini is older. Maybe legends do not age, but Tamil Nadu as a society has. The golden age of politics and its creativity, reciprocity to film is over. Annadurai and MGR are gone, the DMK under Stalin appears a bit like a political still life. The DMK-AIADMK battles that dominated the last few decades create little excitement. In fact, the most exciting person in Chennai is Jayalalithaa. Even as a dead person, she could sweep the election. She has the charisma even as memory to make crowds hysterical and hysteria can flow like a religious current in this city. But what is more obvious than Jayalalithaa’s absence as presence is the emptiness of Tamil politics. Despite being a corrupt prima dona, Jaya had the makings of a Tamil deity. There is a touch of the lukewarm to Rajini’s entry. Probably English language newspapers are more deadpan about it. They make his entry sound like a benign Rotary club meeting. But once one hears Rajini in Tamil, he seems a different person, more in command, almost prophetic about the new digital constituencies he is planning to create. Rajini still offers the politics of hope Tamil Nadu so desperately needs. One break on this move reaching a cinematic climax is the political future of another great star, Kamal Haasan. Haasan too wants to enter politics and make a difference. His seems more the voice of the left, but one is not clear whether Haasan is speaking of his sympathisers on the left or of a need for a fully articulated leftist ideology. While both still stand like Achilles before their tents, Amit Shah and BJP seem busy. They realise the potential of the moment as all the big parties seems dormant. They realise that the creation of a Trojan horse would have a deadly effect, but one wonders whether Tamil Nadu would forgive any one for playing a Trojan horse in a cinematic sense. Tamil Nadu as a society has always been proud of its autonomy from Delhi. Even Modi at the height of his power cut little ice with Jayalalithaa. Yet it is the emptying of politics that haunts one. Tamil Nadu lacks a Periyaar, a Kamraj, a Rajaji and an Annadurai. Each could have mobilised the imagination. Today’s party leaders stand like Uriah Heaps, their very secondariness is so obvious.  The very emptiness of political space is begging Rajini to enter. He realises that he has to offer something new and that the newness of his politics has to at least match the enthusiasm Delhi felt for Kejriwal before he became a more domestic figure. Rajini claims he wants to create a political revolution, the beginning of a spiritual politics. I guess it is his way of saying he wants to initiate an honest politics without invoking a critique of Jaya or DMK. He talks of a politics devoid of caste and religion. I guess what he is looking for is sociology of a new constituency different from the current vote banks that have tied up politics into predictable rhetorical grids. What he is hoping to trigger is a generational change in livelihood and lifestyle, which could redefine society. The script as it stands today sounds empty, or at best, well-intentioned. Rajini does not project the ease of politics. He stands like a star waiting for a cue from the director, desperate for the right plot and the right lines. But the moment, in terms of its timing, has tremendous potential. A new generation wants to rewrite society and Rajini has the stature to lead them. Maybe it is time civil society came to his aide, preparing an ideological programme, and create a new reciprocity between civil society and politics. One is thinking in particular of an attempt to revive the fate of agriculture, marked by epidemics of suicide. What is true of farming is also is also becoming true of fishing. The recent impact of Cyclone Ockhi revealed that the Tamil Nadu politician had no sense of the travails of deep sea fishing. If livelihood politics, human rights and ecology were to combine once more embedded in a theory of culture and the creativity of language, Tamil Nadu can offer a new politics to a Modi embroiled India. I do not think this is the time for cynics or for so-called realists to say that Tamil Nadu politics will continue to see-saw between factions of the Dravidian movement. Rajini has the charisma, and civil society, composed of ecologists, feminists, educationalists, can provide the content for a progressive dream. Like a good actor, Rajini knows how to pick his cues and like a charismatic politician, he can give such ideas a drama, a force which can create a new dream of politics. Society cannot play spectator for long. It has to script the new dream of politics, brushing aside the tiredness and staleness of the old profession politician. It is time for the miracle to happen.

As Maharashtra descended into chaos following the violence orchestrated by rightwing leaders Sambaji Bhide Guruji and Milind Ekbote during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the  , the BJP found itself torn between condemning the rabble-rousers and asserting a pro-Dalit stance to shed the party's label of being an upper-caste party. What seemed easier, obviously, was to keep quiet. In Maharashtra's history of Dalit versus others, two incidents in the past saw a major shift in political dynamics. Back in early 1980s, the Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence when egged on by his \"troubled conscience\" former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar University. After a 16-year-old campaign - Namantar Andolan - Dalits half-succeeded in renaming Aurangabad's Marathawada University to Dr BR Ambedkar Marathwada University. Pawar though was made to pay for his \"altruism\" later as he lost the support of the Maratha community even as Shiv Sena, which strictly opposed the renaming move, further strengthened its base. Pawar, who used to enjoy considerable popularity in the area, could never \"recuperate\" and lost his base among the Marathas. Several attempts to undo the hurt failed as the Namantar Andolan had left the fissures wide open. In another incident which went on to change the political equations in the state, Mumbai police, back in 1997, opened fire upon residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar who were protesting against the desecration of Ambedkar's statue. The police firing claimed as many as 10 lives. The incident led to significant unrest throughout Maharashtra, including rioting and social boycotts against the protesting Dalits.  Although the then Shiv Sena government justified the police action, many couldn't overlook the fact that those in power find it justifiable to use excessive force to muzzle Dalit assertion. This particular incident brought together Dalit groups, including the one led by Prakash Ambedkar and Ramdas Atahawale. The impact of the Ghatkopar incident could be seen in 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Despite riding high on the Ram Mandir issue, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine was brought to its knees by the grand coalition of all republican factions with the Congress and its allies winning 37 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats. Pramod Mahajan too lost his Mumbai North East seat (Ghatkopar East and West Assembly segments fall under Mumbai-North East) due to wide spread anger against the police brutality in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar. The following year in 1999, the Shiv Sena-BJP lost the Assembly elections in Maharshtra. Following the latest spate of violence in Maharashtra, many believe the Bhima-Koregaon episode could prove to be chief minister Davendra Fadnavis' Ramabai Nagar moment.  Even though Fadnavis has been patting the back of his government \"for not letting the violence go out of hand\", the Sena, this time, tore into the BJP government over the violence saying \"the only work left [for the BJP] is to fight elections using the government machinery and the police\". While the BJP doesn't have any prominent Dalit face in Maharashtra, the Bhima Koregaon violence, in all likelihood, will only increase the party's dependence on Union minister Ramdas Athavale, who for years was a staunch opponent of the RSS. The BJP for long has tried to shed its upper-caste label. In 1990s, Parmod Mahajan tried to break the BJP's image of a \"shetji bhatji’ (Baniya-Brahman) party with the help of Gopinath Munde by wooing the OBCs. While Munde became the BJP's OBC face, Dalits still remained far away. Dalits, who form around 11 per cent of the population in Maharshtra, have been a solid social block behind the Congress and Pawar's NCP. After winning the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP tried its best to bring the Dalits into its fold. It was precisely why Athawale - one of the prominent Dalit faces of Maharashtra - was brought to Rajya Sabha and then made a Union minister. Despite that, Dalit support to the BJP remains elusive. With the latest spate of violence, the BJP will find it harder to decide whether to woo the Dalits or to rile the Marathas, who form about 30 per cent of the state's population. ","title":"How Bhima Koregaon violence poses a major risk to BJP's Dalit politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-upper-caste-bjp-fadnavis-brahmins-dalits-atrocities-violence-hindutva/story/1/21563.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15336},{"author":"Chandra Kumar Bose","content":"\"Rose early but found Prabha still suffering. A son was born at midday..,\" reads a brief entry in Janakinath Bose's diary dated January 23, 1897. The newborn, the ninth child of Janakinath and Prabhabati Devi, was named Subhas. Janakinath was then practising law in Cuttack, in the state of Orissa. He headed a large extended family.   later recalled in his autobiography,  , he felt \"like a thoroughly insignificant being. My parents awed me to a degree\", in the family. It is now 121 years since the birth of Subhas Chandra Bose, and 73 years since his last known journey out of South East Asia, reportedly to the Soviet Union, in mid-August 1945. On January 23 every year Subhas' birth anniversary is celebrated across India. Speeches extolling Bose's charisma and personality, his unique contributions towards Indian independence continue to be made, and stirring national songs continue to be sung in his honour. On that day, in addition to institutionally sponsored events, spontaneous remembrance ceremonies organised by neighbourhood and citizens' groups also take place. This is a unique feature associated only with   birth anniversary which reflects the depth of people's veneration for him after more than half-a-century of his disappearance. This, in a sense, is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life to liberating India from British colonial rule, and had a vision to make \"Free India\" one of the leading nations in the world. But January 23 will pass and Bose will again be relegated to the pages of history. Though deified by many, his ideology and mission are forgotten. Worse, they are not even known by the younger generations of Indians. From his entry into the Indian political movement in the early 1920s, through his prison years and bouts of serious illnesses, Subhas had developed his thoughts on social, political and economic issues which then formed the basis of his ideology. His famous address as the president of the 51st session of the Indian National Congress at Haripura in 1938 contains the crux of his political and economic thinking and plans. Is it widely known that it was in Haripura that Subhas launched the very first Planning Commission for India? In all his key addresses in India and abroad, in articles published in various journals, Subhas articulated his vision for a free India. In his view, the most important problems to be addressed in independent India were that of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, challenges which have not been met even after 70 years of independence. Together with the celebratory functions, a more fitting tribute to Subhas' memory will be to effectively propagate his vision and ideology, which will in turn promote a better understanding of the history and politics of India, and also inspire the present generation of Indians to shape the country on the basis of the high moral values and principles that Subhas stood for and practised all his life. Subhas' works should be part of school and university curricula. Research institutes, including Netaji Subhas Foundation, Kolkata and London, should actively encourage and support national and international scholars to reassess Subhas' role in the Indian independence movement, and also his contemporary relevance. A deeper study of his works will show that many of his social and economic plans still remain valid. In the current Indian situation where there is a bankruptcy of leadership, ideas, commitment and action, Subhas' message, through his writings, speeches and commentaries may help to resurrect the failing morale of those who are working to bring positive change in this country. Above all,   life-long emphasis on the importance of communal harmony and unity among people, irrespective of birth, caste, creed and religion, has not only remained relevant, it has also gained a sense of urgency. In a world torn by ethnic, tribal, religious and regional conflicts, Bose's unqualified rejection of bigotry of any kind from the very outset of his entry into the Indian political scene, and his repeated call for unity among all Indians, famously reflected in the motto of the Indian National Army - Unity, Faith and Sacrifice, alone can help create a secure foundation of contemporary India. Conscious of the grave danger that communalism posed to a country such as India, where people of many faiths were inextricably mixed together over centuries, Subhas had repeatedly warned against the virus of religious bigotry entering the fabric of politics. In referring to what should be the attitude towards religion and caste, Subhas had declared \"... the government of free India must have an absolutely neutral and impartial attitude toward all religions and leave it to the choice of every individual to profess or follow a particular religious faith\" (The Fundamental Problems of India, address at Tokyo University, November 1944). Subhas' legacy will be better served if he is brought alive through his works. However, there is another reality. During the time of the British Raj, Subhas was treated as enemy No 1 and his book  , banned across the coutry. This is understandable and could have been expected from a colonial power determined to hold on to India and ready to suppress any threat to its rule. It is therefore particularly ironic that after the government of free India took charge, a systematic attempt was made to reduce Subhas merely to a Bengal hero, who though deemed idealistic, was seen as a misled individual, and had made the terrible mistake of discarding Mahatma Gandhi's non violent ways in India's freedom struggle. It is only because Subhas had entered the minds and hearts of the Indian people, and of the peoples of Asia, that all attempts at diminishing his stature and role in Indian and global politics have not fully succeeded. The role of the first government of independent India under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in this process of suppression and distortion cannot be ignored or denied. Historians have noted that Nehru had always perceived Subhas as his main rival, and his own statements bear evidence to that fact. Subhas himself had once written that \"nobody has done more harm to me personally and to our cause in this crisis than Pandit Nehru\" (letter to his nephew Amiya Nath Bose, April 17, 1939). As more evidence begins to emerge, it will be possible to make an objective and proper assessment of the role and personalities of our leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and others. When in August 1945 Subhas disappeared, his beloved elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose was in prison. Sarat and Subhas had shared an extraordinary relationship as brothers. Their close personal and emotional bond was enriched and deepened by their shared social and political ideology and goals. After Sarat was released in September 1945, he immediately resumed his campaign for a free and united India. He also decided to acquire the family's ancestral house on Elgin Road in Calcutta to establish an institution for the study and propagation of Subhas' ideology. In 1946, Sarat inaugurated \"Netaji Bhawan\" at their ancestral house and laid the foundations for a Netaji museum and research centre in the name of his brother, who was by then popularly known as Netaji (our leader). It was Sarat's wish that the Bose house should also be used for public and charitable purposes. The Azad Hind Ambulance Service, which he started, provided much-needed medical and social services in the city, especially during the dark days of communal strife. These were tumultuous times for Bengal and India as a whole. A new alternative was beginning to emerge in Bengal's political firmament. Hope turned to Sarat Bose to carry the torch ahead. He became the undisputed leader of the Congress in West Bengal. He was then elected leader of the Congress in the Central Legislative Assembly and became the leader of the Opposition. Sarat's membership of the interim government was, however, short-lived. He left the interim cabinet and the Congress refusing to agree to the partition of India on communal lines. Within a few years, a greater tragedy was to strike. On February 20, 1950, the very morning Sarat was to make an urgent appeal to the people of the two Bengals to reunite, he suddenly passed away. In an attempt to keep alive Bose's legacy and to give it concrete shape, the close followers of the Bose brothers, supported by Sarat's family, set up Sarat Bose Academy at Netaji Bhawan in 1952. It gathered within its fold eminent historians, lawyers, journalists and other committed voluntary workers. It also attracted interested persons from overseas. The academy launched an ambitious programme to develop Netaji Bhawan as a centre of excellence for research and exchange on both national and international affairs. It also aimed to function as a centre for the promotion of arts, music and languages, while continuing to provide other public services. It was to be the main archive for the works of Sarat and Subhas and for all types of documents and records related to them. The major objective of collecting key documents as well as photos and films on the life and activities of Subhas Chandra Bose began in earnest. Amiya Nath Bose, general secretary of Sarat Bose Academy, who took up his father Sarat's mantle, engaged himself fully in this task. He collected a substantial amount of materials, including primary documents, newspaper clippings, journals, films and other stuff on Netaji's activities both from India and abroad. All of these materials were deposited at the Netaji Museum and archives to be made available \"... to students and scholars for the study of and research about the life and work of Netaji...\" The Sarat Bose Academy began publication of Subhas and Sarat's works, and set up a comprehensive photographic exhibition portraying the life and work of the Bose brothers. By the late 1950s, significant progress had been made in the collection of materials for the Netaji Museum and its archives, and it was concluded that it would be appropriate to create a separate body \"to undertake a systematic study of Netaji's life and mission\". This ultimately led to the creation of the Netaji Research Bureau in 1957 under the chairmanship of well-known journalist Satya Ranjan Bakshi and Sisir Kumar Bose (a son of Sarat Bose) as general secretary. Thus, Netaji Bhawan, with its three main organs - Sarat Bose Academy, Netaji Research Bureau and Azad Hind Ambulance Service - was designed to act as the lead institution to uphold and promote the Bose brothers' legacy, and to work towards realising their cherished goals. However, here again the forces bent upon destroying the legacy went to work. Gradually, the Netaji Research Bureau came under the direct influence of the Nehru dynasty dominated central government. The Sarat Bose Academy moved out of Netaji Bhawan. Netaji Research Bureau became the only organ to remain under the directorship of Sisir Bose. Since its inception until now, over a period of 61 years, the Netaji Research Bureau has accomplished one of its basic goals and has published in 12 volumes, almost all of the writings, speeches and letters of Subhas, the bulk of which was originally collected under the auspices of Sarat Bose Academy. The Netaji Research Bureau has reportedly obtained substantial funding from the central government. But judged against its own objectives, and what was envisaged by its founders, the work of Netaji Research Bureau may be said to have been limited. Netaji's own works are not widely available, and conditions to access the archives at Netaji Bhawan are obscure. Was there a price to pay for support from those who have an interest in keeping the Bose brother's legacy in check? In view of the current realities of India today, those who believe in Subhas' ideology and its relevance in contemporary India, must take the initiative to revive, disseminate and act on the basis of that ideology. Such initiatives are already being taken by certain civil society and media groups both in India and abroad. A website is being launched by The Bose Legacy - www.theboselegacy.com - which will be an online archive for all of Subhas' works, a data base of bibliographies and scholars. It will also contain photographs and audio-visual material. The overall objective is to provide access to relevant materials to all those who wish to study the life, activities and ideology of Subhas, and also to those who wish to define their actions in terms of Bose's vision of India and the world.

From small mandals (groups) to chowks, almost everything is named after Hindutva icons. No wonder the controversial Sambhaji Bhide chose this place as his Karma bhoomi. On reaching Sangli on December 4, we saw a huge procession in support of Bhide, who is fondly called as Bhide Guruji by his followers. The 85-year-old founder of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is accused of orchestrating the violence at the   of the battle fought 200 years ago in Bhima Koregaon. As we headed towards his house in Gaonbhag area, we were told that Guruji does not carry a cellphone (or \"bhraman dhwani\" as he calls it). So once he picks up his bicycle and leaves, no one knows his whereabouts. The Datta Niwas building is situated in a narrow bylane of the old town. A police van was parked outside the lane, even though Bhide has not been provided any security cover. As we neared his house, it seemed almost everyone knew the way to his first-floor abode. However, much to our disappointment, we found ourselves staring at a lock on the door. We left a small note at the doorstep. Not too many people know about the staunch Hindutva ideologue, especially outside Maharashtra, but for those who have closely followed the state's identity politics, Bhide Guruji is a familiar name. An ardent follower of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, many say, Bhide's real name is Manohar but he calls himself Sambhaji after the Maratha king. Maratha organisations like Sambhaji Brigade or Maratha Mahasangh allege that Bhide, who is an upper caste Brahmin, deliberately professes Maratha history in a Brahminical perspective. Guruji has a sizeable following in western Maharashtra, particularly in Sangli district, and parts of neighbouring Karnataka. The man with a magnum moustache is usually dressed in a white kurta pajama or dhoti, but never wears a footwear - no matter where he goes. His followers say that Bhide is an MSc in nuclear physics from Pune University and has also served as a professor in Pune's Fergusson College long ago. In Sangli, Bhide is often seen riding a bicycle. He delivers sermons on Shivaji and Sambhaji, most of which are focused on the warrior kings as Hindutva icons. In 2009, he found himself embroiled in a controversy when communal violence broke out in the twin cities of Miraj-Sangli in Sangli district during Ganpati visarjan over an arch, sporting a poster that depicted the slaying of Afzhal Khan - the most capable commander of Ali Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate - at the hands of Chhatrapati Shivaji. It was reportedly erected just a day before Ganesh visarjan. Even though many demanded his arrest, Bhide came out \"victorious\" without a single scratch. The man is known for his fiery talks on the lives of Shivaji Maharaj heavily laced with hatred for Muslims. And until the recent Bhima Koregaon violence, which Bhide is accused of inciting along with Milind Ekbote, he was not known to be anti-Dalit. Bhide's Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is mainly known for training youths in physical education. Every year during Navratri, Bhide organises a marathon called \"Durga Daud\". Many prominent politicians in the past have graced the event. Not widely known outside Maharashtra, Bhide made national headlines in 2014 when Prime Minister  , during a 2014 Assembly election rally in Sangli, reportedly referred to the hardcore Hindutva activist as one of his inspirations. \"Bhide Guruji did not invite me here. I came here on his orders,” Modi had said during the rally,\" Modi had said. Those close to Bhide say the once-RSS pracharak split from the Sangh Parivar following difference of opinion with former RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras. Ever since then he has been busy running the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, albeit on the lines of the RSS. Much like the practice in RSS shakhas, we came to know, Bhide and his followers gather at their office every morning for workout sessions. We decided to catch up with him there. On a cold Friday morning, our team reached the Vishnu Ghat on the banks of river Krishna. A group of men had already begun their \"surya namaskar\" amid chanting of mantras. We were told that Bhide usually reaches by 5am. We kept waiting on the stairs of a temple watching another group of senior citizens practising laughter yoga. A while later, Bhide came riding his old bicycle. After greeting us, the first thing he asked us to do was to put aside our cameras. He then asked us to join us in his morning prayers and introduced us to others as \"guests of Sangli from Mumbai\". The prayers started with \"Jayatu Hindu Rashtram (long Iive the Hindu nation)\". While the prayers, offered to goddess Bhawani, praised Shivaji and Sambhaji, it was difficult to miss the religious undertones. After the prayers, the group got ready for another round of surya namaskar. Bhide, we were told, has added two additional surya mantras to the usual cycle in the name of Shivaji and Sambhaji. After we joined him in his workout and prayers, the man seemed comfortable talking to us. As soon as he is asked about the Bhima Koregaon violence, he vehemently claimed innocence and said it was a political conspiracy. He even appealed for a thorough inquiry into the incident. Giving examples from Mahabharata, he told us that even \"lord Krishna had to face allegations of theft\". As he got up to leave on his cycle cutting through a line of followers who had gathered to meet him, it was clear Bhide's no ordinary man.","title":"On meeting Bhima Koregaon violence accused Sambhaji Bhide","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sambhaji-bhide-sangli-house-bhima-koregaon-dalit-atrocities-bhide-guruji-violence-hindutva/story/1/21569.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15338},{"author":"Sourish Bhattacharyya","content":"The manufactured outrage over the annual Dalit-led celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the  , unless seen through the pseudo-nationalist lenses, is yet another aggressive Hindutva attempt to muzzle the new Dalit voices that are becoming louder after the marginalisation of the likes of Mayawati and Ramdas Athawale. It is an expression of the venomous bigotry that drives the ill-informed Hindutva narrative - the very same bigotry that sparked off the Karni Sena anger against  , a film purportedly (I use the word deliberately because no one has seen it, apart from Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, outside the CBFC) based on an allegorical Sufi poem written in 1540 CE by a Muslim, Malik Muhammad Jayasi, about a fictional princess from Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka; note, she wasn't a Rajput), who becomes the queen of Chittor, and Allauddin Khilji falls in love with her. Understandably, the country has gone into election mode, and Hindutva loyalists have little to brag about after three and half years in power, except an economy where the fiscal deficit has spiralled out of control, jobs are hard to find, the farming sector is wracked by crises and prices of essential commodities showing no signs of abatement, even as Pakistan continues to kill and maim our braveheart soldiers in cold blood. There's only one way to deflect national attention away from the paralysis of equitable development that has set in. And the cynical strategy is to   to polarise voters - Hindus against Muslims and Christians, and the upper castes against Dalits. It started with the so-called \"love jihad\" and the alleged cow smugglers, but the virus, post-Gujarat Assembly elections, has infected the national discourse. Branding Rahul Gandhi as being anti-triple talaq bill when all his party, along with 17 others, has asked for is a parliamentary select committee review of one provision of the bill, is the latest expression of this nation-corroding argument. Questioning the legitimacy of Jignesh Mevani joining the annual celebrations of the Battle of Koregaon - the victory of a unit of the East India Company (comprising 900 Mahar soldiers) over the Peshwa Bajirao II's army in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, a commemoration whose history goes back to January 1, 1927, when BR Ambedkar started the tradition as an assertion of Dalit opposition to upper caste oppression, which had been institutionalised by the Brahminical Peshwas - is a strand of the same divisive narrative. Any Indian citizen can legitimately join a celebration, even it has political overtones, in any part of the country. If a Bhojpuri film star can represent North East Delhi and become the president of the BJP's Delhi unit, how can Jigesh Mevani be questioned for emerging as yet another national voice of the Dalits? Only those with a Peshwa mindset will parrot (reminds me of Padmavati's parrot in Jayasi's poem) such arguments, including the one linking Mevani with Umar Khalid, who, like any other Indian citizen, has the right to engage in a political or any other activity in any part of the country. This argument is as destructive as the mischievous misrepresentation of the acronym HAJ (Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh) formed with the first letters of the names of the three youth leaders who turned the political tide in Gujarat during the recent elections. Politics aside, let's turn to facts to make sense of the mayhem that just shook Maharashtra: 1) It was Chhatrapati Shivaji, who's much loved by the Hindutva army, who inducted Mahars into his army as scouts and guards of forts. 2) The tradition was discontinued by the Peshwas, who heaped inhuman insults upon the Mahars, like insisting that they have a broom tied to their back (to clear their footprints) and hang an earthen pitcher from their necks to prevent their shadow from \"polluting\" the streets. The celebration of the East India Company's victory in the Battle of Koregaon is not a homage paid to a colonial army, but an assertion of Dalit power against Brahminical oppression. 3) If the celebration of the Battle of Koregaon tantamounts to paying homage to colonialism, then the BJP, too, stands guilty of the same charge because of its opposition in Karnataka to Tipu Sultan, who fought the East India Company till his last dying moment. 4) After the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when British colonial generals, led by Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, floated the myth of the martial races, the Mahars were edged out of the British Indian Army and eventually the regiment bearing the name of the caste was disbanded in 1895. For the Mahars, the army provided an escape from their dehumanised life in a caste-oppressed society, which was why they kept demanding that their regiment be reinstated - a demand that was supported by Mahatma Gandhi's political guru, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and later, the Indian National Congress even though it was opposed to the army recruitment policies of the British Raj. 5) It was the British Indian Army that provided a caste-free upbringing to BR Ambedkar, whose father, Subedar Ramji Sakpal, was a teacher in the Mahar Regiment school at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. That may have been the reason why Ambedkar, as member of the viceroy's Defence Advisory Committee in 1941, made a strong pitch for the revival of the Mahar Regiment. 6) The viceroy accepted Ambedkar's plea and the first battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum in October 1941. In the years that followed until Independence, the regiment expanded steadily, saw action in Burma and Iraq, was among the first to become a machine gun regiment in 1946 (it was then that the Koregaon Victory Pillar, the scene of the January 1 celebrations, was replaced by two crossed Vickers machine guns on the regimental crest), and provided security to refugees during the Partition bloodbath. Post-Independence, it became a more integrative unit with the induction of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujaratis who were rejected as non-martial by the British. The Mahars today are 21 battalions strong and have produced two distinguished Army chiefs, General KV Krishna Rao and General K Sundarji. Most importantly, the regiment has given the community back the self-pride that the Peshwas had snuffed out. Hindutva bullies who don't want the Dalits to celebrate their moment of freedom are pursuing cynical electoral manoeuvres that can only lead to one loss - the inclusive idea of India that had been so caringly seeded by Jawaharlal Nehru and nurtured by all those who practise the politics of inclusion.","title":"Attack on Dalits celebrating the 200th anniversary of Battle of Koregaon is a forewarning on what's to come","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-dalits-hindutva-maharashtra-bandh-rss-jignesh-mevani-umar-khalid/story/1/21544.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15339},{"author":"Rajeev Sharma","content":"The real intentions of Pakistan behind the Christmas Day meeting between Kulbhushan Jadhav and his wife and mother - with a glass partition in between - have been exposed by Maulana Ameer Hamza, one of the founders of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). That the entire event was stage-managed by Pakistan to score brownie-points against India was revealed by Maulana Ameer Hamza at a public rally last week in Rawalpindi when he  : \"ISI and Pakistan government humiliated Jadhav's family during their visit to Islamabad. They also made Jadhav face his family across a glass wall… India had requested Pakistan to allow Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet him. Pakistan showed mercy and invited them. India thought that they would meet Jadhav face-to-face on a sofa, but the ISI didn’t allow it.” Hamza's boastful remarks indicate the following: 1) The meeting between Jadhav and his wife and mother was a charade, meant to humiliate the Jadhav family and send a wry message to India; 2) The existence of a nefarious nexus between the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistan government and how the ISI choreographed the entire event though preparations for the meeting were largely between the foreign offices of the two countries; 3) The camaraderie between terror outfits and the Pakistani military establishment as Maulana Ameer Hamza was speaking at a public rally which couldn’t have taken place without the ISI's prior approval and the fact that he sought to lionise the ISI at the Rawalpindi rally. Does it not sound weird that the leader of a notorious terror outfit praises the host country’s premier intelligence agency? Such a scenario would have been shameful for any civilised nation, but in Pakistan it is a routine. It’s not for nothing that Pakistan is repeatedly hauled over the coals by the international community over terrorism, the latest in this never-ending series being extremely tough remarks against Pakistan by US President Donald Trump. Pakistan took the extreme measure of allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav to meet his mother and wife knowing that they needed to pre-empt any strictures being passed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On September 13, India submitted its written pleadings to the ICJ. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, while responding to a question regarding the development, had stated that \"India has…submitted its memorial (written pleadings) to the ICJ in the Jadhav case involving egregious violation of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 by Pakistan. This is in furtherance of our application filed before the Court on May 8, 2017\". Earlier in May 2017, the ICJ had stayed Jadhav’s execution by Pakistan and had asked both parties to submit their written pleadings by September 13, 2017. Pakistani commentator Ejaz Haider had recently commented in an  : \"That Jadhav is important for India is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by New Delhi approaching the ICJ.\" One could counter that by saying thus: “That Jadhav is important to Pakistan is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by Pakistan constantly using him as a tool to pick on India sponsoring terrorism in Balochistan.”  The reality is that Pakistan got Jadhav on a platter and is using him to the hilt. It needs to be recalled that Jadhav was kidnapped in Iran and delivered to Pakistan by a faction of the Taliban working for Iran. The Taliban sold him to the Pakistanis for a price. And thereby hangs the tale. Pakistan first announced that they would accede to the Indian request to let Jadhav’s family meet him in Pakistan and promptly provided visas for the same on December 20, 2017. However, it is noteworthy that Pakistan did not grant consular access to any authorised personnel of the Indian Mission in Islamabad prior to the meeting, but instead only permitted the family to meet Jadhav. The meeting on December 25 was more of a charade than a meeting on humanitarian grounds. Importantly, the family was not allowed to converse in Marathi with Jadhav, to ensure that the Pakistanis could understand what exchange took place between the prisoner and his family. The family’s meeting with Jadhav, according to their own version, showed that Jadhav was under stress and spoke under coercion. Pakistan subsequently claimed that the procedure followed for the meeting, including asking the mother and wife to change their attire, had been agreed to by both countries in advance, a fact which India has firmly denied. Earlier in September last year, Pakistan's foreign minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, let out a canard that there was a   for a swap between Jadhav and a Pakistani who was involved in the Peshawar Army Public School attack and was said to be in Afghan custody. Asif claimed that India’s NSA Ajit Doval had told him that India could exchange that terrorist with the \"terrorist\" Pakistan had, namely Jadhav. Asif made these remarks while speaking at the Asia Society in New York, but the idea was quickly shot down by both India and Afghanistan. The issue of a swap may well have been discussed at some stage, but there appears to be no reason why Afghanistan should give their acquiescence to an Indian request to let off a known Afghan terrorist in their custody. Furthermore, if one goes back to reports of the terrorist strike at the APS Peshawar, there were six terrorists involved in the attack - one Chechen, two Afghans and three Arabs. In the rescue operation carried out by Pakistani Special Services Group, all six terrorists were killed. So who is this special guy the Afghans were holding on to as Asif claimed in September 2017? The mastermind of the Peshawar attack Omar Khorasani, was killed in a drone strike in October 2017. So much for Pakistan's claims of being the honest dealer and allowing India to meet with the family of commander Kulbhushan Jadhav. By the way, Jadhav is not a serving Indian Navy officer and had, in fact, retired in 2001. He had been working independently in Chahbahar Port in Iran since 2003. At the time of his arrest in March 2016, the Pakistani establishment planted a fake passport on him in the name of Hussein Mubarak Patel and claimed that he was a spy who had worked for India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) since 2013. The Pakistani narrative has always held that he is an active naval officer, a claim that appears false because of two things. First, India would not send a serving naval officer as an undercover agent to Iran. Second, if the officer was serving and had been posted to Chahbahar in uniform he would have diplomatic cover. Meanwhile, on December 25 last year, Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani (a Shia country that the Sunni Pakistan is frantically trying to become close to), while addressing a news conference in Islamabad after attending a six-nation anti-terror conference in Islamabad, said: “Kulbhushan was doing business in Chahbahar and we had no information about him being a spy. The security institutions of both countries (Pakistan and Iran) had already exchanged information in this regard.” It is time for India to call Pakistan’s bluff and continue to work with the international community and increase pressure through the ICJ to get consular access to Jadhav. India must make all efforts to ensure that Jadhav is brought back to India alive. That would be a fitting honour for a former naval officer and an Indian national who deserves better than being a pawn in Pakistani hands.","title":"How ISI choreographed Kulbhushan Jadhav's meeting with family to humiliate India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kulbhushan-jadhav-wife-mother-meeting-mea-pakistan-let-isi/story/1/21526.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15340},{"author":"Romita Datta","content":"She had once called her \"Ma/Jangalmahal er Ma\" (mother, mother of Jangal Mahal). And the mother very often would tell others what a good girl she was. Often this mutual admiration would be on the dais of political rallies and government programmes in full public view. This was in 2011 and it continued for seven years as the mother's \"bhalo meye\" - or the good girl - obediently and with the right dosage of obeisance was toeing her line, fulfilling all her wishes and definitely becoming indispensable to her. The daughter in question is Bharati Ghosh, former SP of West Midnapore, and the mother is none other than Mamata Banerjee. Bharati, who was part of a UN peacekeeping mission for years and a former management student of Harvard, came to Bengal in 2011 and drew Mamata's attention after the latter took over as the chief minister of the state. From the state CID, she was made the SP of West Midnapore, which witnessed Maoist violence after 2008. Bharati, with her vast experience in war-torn places of Kosovo and Bosnia, was thought fit to tackle the Maoists. Like an efficient cop, she decimated the Maoists and was responsible for the death of their leader, Koteswar Rao, in a severe gun-battle. The other prominent Maoists operating in that area, and responsible for death of jawans in police camps, were wooed over with handsome packages, and the young turks who dreamt of a classless revolution were won over in the fold of the ruling party with posts, power and privileges. The backward areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore became free of not just the Maoist menace but of any dissenting voices. The districts surrendered and Mamata compensated with heavy doses of development, plugging all possibilities of a Maoist regrouping. And all this was largely possible because of Bharati Ghosh, who dared to be deadly different. Gradually, Bharati gained Mamata's confidence and according to the Opposition, she was less of a police officer and more of a party functionary. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in the 2016 Assembly polls, Bharati  . She was transferred by the EC from the SP's post for allegedly intimidating poll officers and overstepping her jurisdiction. In 2016, she was reprimanded for exceeding her brief and meeting political persons, especially Mukul Roy, then second-in-command of the Trinamool Congress, while model code of conduct was in place. The rap from the EC had no effect on Bharati as Mamata awarded her with prized posting, more power and punch, and greater responsibility. As Bharati went on antagonising Mamata's enemies, she scored brownie points in her career, obviously gaining in the confidence of the chief minister. But finally what soured the relation was Mukul Roy leaving the Trinamool Congress and joining the BJP. Bharati, known to be close and loyal to Roy, became a prime suspect in the eyes of the chief minister. As Roy started consolidating the base of the BJP in the Jungle Mahal area, there were rumours that Bharati was using her clout and muscle power to help him make deep inroads. The final nail in the coffin was the result of the by-election in Sabang in West Midnapore district. Though the Trinamool Congress won with a huge margin of over 67,000 votes and BJP came third, the latter increased its vote share by 17 per cent and that was enough to keep tongues wagging. The Congress-turned-Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Manas Bhuniya, who hailed from Sabang and was a strong critique of Bharati Ghosh since the time he was in the Opposition as a Congress MLA, saw this as an opportunity to turn Mamata against her \"good girl\". There were allegations from the district intelligence office that Bharati had held meetings with BJP leaders and was helping them improve their vote share. Logically, Bharati stood to gain by siding with the BJP. Mamata also had a hunch that Bharati would prefer to work for the party at the Centre given her ambition and career prospects. Immediately after the Sabang by-election results came out, Bharati was removed to an insignificant post as an officer of State Armed Police in Barrackpore. But Bharati   to the DG of police. While the resignation will help her think clearly on what should be the next step, it will also free her of her commitments to the service rules. She is threatening to open her mouth and settle scores. To swallow her resignation would mean handing over an ammo to BJP, since Bharati by virtue of being close to the ruling Trinamool Congress shared many secrets, especially the ones that the \"mother-daughter\" duo exchanged. Mamata has initiated an internal investigation against Bharati Ghosh to ensure she keeps mum, but given the stubborn daughter she is, Bharati might not buckle. Taking up the challenge of a duel, Bharati has also retorted saying that she too has a tale to tell. Any one listening?","title":"Why Mamata Banerjee and her 'cop daughter' Bharati Ghosh fell apart","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mamata-banerjee-bharti-ghosh-2014-lok-sabha-elections-trinamool-congress-mukul-roy/story/1/21532.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15341},{"author":"Kamlesh Sutar","content":"The usually peaceful celebrations at the Bhima Koregaon village every year to commemorate the battle of 1818, took an unusually   on January 1. The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a \"Bahujan\" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of \"Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak\" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and \"Gau-Brahman prati palak\" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as \"Rayate cha Raja\" (king of the ryots). \r\n \r\n Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ","title":"How Bhima Koregaon battle anniversary turned into a riot","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-protests-dalits-killed-maharashtra-bjp-devendra-fadnavis-caste-politics/story/1/21500.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15342},{"author":"Aninda Dey","content":"Donald Trump may have forced   to cringe in his grave. The swashbuckling, swaggering playboy-US Congressman from Texas and   were brothers in arms literally - Pakistan was the conduit for channelling Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who finally started shooting down the lethal, much-feared Soviet Hind copters (Mi-24s) - or \"Shaitan-Arba\" (Satan’s Chariot) - with pinpoint accuracy in Afghanistan. As more planeloads of Stingers and other weapons landed in Pakistan, Wilson and Zia bonded closer. “Yes, Charlie did it,” remarked Zia after the Soviets met their Waterloo and made an ignominious exit. While Wilson loved Pakistan, he hated India. His hatred was evident when he dubbed India hypocritical and a satellite of the erstwhile Soviet Union in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003. “My general experience of Indians is that they are rather arrogant, know a lot more than anyone else about most things and are stiff-necked. Just like the Americans. But I noticed that they changed very quickly once the Soviets collapsed.” However, the Faustian pact the US had struck with the dreaded Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to counter the Soviets continued as Zia bled J&K under Operation Topaz with Uncle Sam turning a blind eye. The devilish deal would come back to haunt the US with Wilson’s rampaging \"Frankenstein\" in Afghanistan transforming itself into Godzilla - the very Mujahideen mutated into the Taliban and the ISI, under its rugged and foxy director Hamid Gul, nurtured the Taliban with Saudi money.   Washington continued to nurture the relationship with Pakistan and billions of dollars in aid flowed into the country. From 2002 to 2016, the US has provided more than $14 billion in aid to Pakistan with the highest assistance of $2,100 million in 2011 - the same year in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hunted down by the Navy Seal Team Six in a house close to Pakistan’s military academy in Abbottabad. The Afghan abyss still stares at the US. Trump blocking $255-million in military aid to Pakistan is perhaps the biggest jolt for Islamabad after Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad. Despite billions of dollars of aid, Pakistan and the ISI has been helping the Taliban, the Haqqani network, LeT and JeM. With the Islamic State (IS) entering Afghanistan, America faces a two-headed snake. Although the US has not given the specific reason for the aid blockade, Trump’s Afghanistan policy - which targeted Pakistan for not doing enough to rein in terrorists - and the threat from the IS and the LeT seem to have prompted the president.      As the IS is rapidly losing ground in Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan could be its next bastion. The threat of IS plotting attacks on the US in Afghanistan looms large. According to the New America Foundation, there have been several IS-inspired attacks on US soil. The IS had claimed responsibility for the attack on an exhibition of Prophet Muhammad cartoons in Garland, Texas, in 2015. In the first IS-inspired attack on US, the two attackers had been in touch with an online recruiter for the terror outfit. In the latest IS-inspired attack in October 2017, Uzbek   Sayfullo Saipov rammed a rented truck into pedestrians and cyclists near the World Trade Center, killing eight. In the worst terrorist attack since 9/11, the IS claimed responsibility for the Orlando gay nightclub attack in which   shot dead 50 people. Although the LeT primarily focusses on India, it poses threat to the US as well. Times Square bomber   was trained by the LeT in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Way back in 2013, Jonah Blank, senior political scientists at RAND Corporation, had raised the possibility of a 26/11-like attack in the US. She told the Committee on Homeland Security, “A Mumbai-style attack - that is, an attack dramatic and shocking enough to inspire widespread terror even without the use of weapons of mass destruction or a casualty-count in the thousands - remains a realistic near-term threat to the homeland. Such an attack might be termed, \"Boston Squared\" - that is, an attack similar to the   in April, but much larger in effect.” Stressing the LeT’s capability, experience and resourcefulness, Blank said the terror outfit had “enjoyed virtually open support from the Pakistani state throughout the 1990s, and has received at least tacit protection from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate since the group was officially banned by Islamabad in 2002”. Top al Qaeda commander Abu Zubaydah was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 2002, in an LeT safe house. “Lashkar-e Taiba is a de facto affiliate of al Qaeda, and is believed to have joined Osama bin Laden's International Islamic Front for jihad sometime after the umbrella group's famous fatwa in 1998,” Blank added. Trump is riled by the continued ISI support to the Taliban and the Haqqani network, which has been frustrating US efforts to come out of the Afghan imbroglio. After more than 15 years and thousands of casualties, the US has failed to beat the battle-hardened Taliban, which now hold sway over 60 per cent of Afghanistan. ","title":"Trump blocking $255-mn aid is perhaps the biggest jolt to Pakistan after Abbottabad raid","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/trump-pakistan-zia-charlie-wilson-osama-bin-laden-abbottabad-isi/story/1/21507.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15343},{"author":"Anand Balasubramanian","content":"Actor Rajinikanth has launched a  as a quick follow-up to his big announcement of entering politics on December 31, 2017.  Leaving aside the fact that the website is as basic as it comes and looks cluttered, how far will this be helpful in taking his political career forward with the recruitment of new members is the real question. \r\n \r\n Online recruitment is not new in Indian politics. The Congress has an online membership form through which you can become a member of the party without visiting any of its offices. All you need is a copy of your voter ID card. The BJP takes this a step further and gives you an option between becoming a member and online aficionado of the party with portal user-only access. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK and the DMK too allow online enrolment into the party. When it comes to reaching out to their followers, almost all big names have mobile apps. Even new entrants who are yet to launch their parties such as actors Kamal Haasan and Vishal have launched their own apps to connect with the people. While these apps and website will definitely be useful, will it really be a key player in inviting new members into the party? Well, yes. It will attract the current generation who are perpetually glued to their phone screens to join the party or their cause. The only issue is, how to convert these members into actual votes. When one had to visit an office, fill out a form and pay a membership fee, the person joining the party would have to have the intention and the will to join for him to put in that effort. If you belong to the left-wing political parties, you are expected to share a portion of your monthly purse with the party. You will be forced to make a conscious decision of following the ideology of the party and going out of your way before joining it. Even though this is not foolproof, it will at the very least ensure that the person who joins your party has the will to vote for you at the time of contributing to your vote share in the constituency.   When all you have to do is fill up four to five fields in an online form to join a party, you will not only attract the “why not” crowd, but also the mischievous, if not malicious elements. This could lead to embarrassing situations in the future since the party leadership would be answerable for their actions. It would also end up inflating the party numbers and giving false hope to the party leadership. Another question that the party needs to ask itself is if the numbers generated from online membership actually translate into votes in its favour. But make no mistake about it, apps and websites are absolutely essential in today’s age. It will help the party and the leader keep his cadre engaged. Providing an app to existing party members where they would need their party ID to login would help them keep their base consolidated. It will also keep them apprised of the party’s current stand on important issues, rally them for protests and even help them provide effective feedback to the party leadership on the local issues. However, the effectiveness of online recruitment of party members is something that is untested and may prove to be ineffective for a start-up party. If Rajinikanth plans to convert these members directly into party cadre en masse, he would have to be wary of the pitfalls that would ensue with the strategy. For, people who probably do not want to see Rajinikanth in politics, can use the website/app to infiltrate into the party and corrupt his base and image altogether. That is one danger the existing parties with consolidated base which use the app or website for communication is safe from.  ","title":"Should Rajinikanth's digital drive worry his political opponents?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-political-party-online-recruitment-android-mobile-app-website/story/1/21509.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15344},{"author":"Manoj Joshi","content":"When it comes to the Modi government’s foreign policy record, you can see it as a glass half full or a glass half empty. Full or empty, it was half. It did not meet its full potential and there were more misses than hits, especially in the neighbourhood, in 2017. But there was one significant achievement which has made up for this and has important portents for the future. This was facing down Beijing over Doklam which was done with verve and sophistication. So what could 2018 bring? Perhaps its most important motif will be balance. Having stepped out in significant directions in 2015 and 2016 towards the US and Israel, Modi will seek to restore some equilibrium. He will seek to repair ties with China and reach out to Palestine, to signal to the Arab world that Indian policy is not changing. Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanhayu is to visit India in mid-January for the Raisina Dialogue, but that is more about ideological signaling rather than achieving any major foreign policy goal. India is not a player in the Middle East, its primary interest is the stability of this vital region and it would be well advised to maintain its traditional posture of balancing between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the Saudi-Israel entente growing, there could be an argument for a slight tilt in the Iranian direction, else we may see a repeat of a situation where external pressures pushed our ally Russia into the arms of China. Note that Modi’s initiatives in the Gulf sheikhdoms are now paying. Following Modi’s visit in early 2017, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested nearly $3 billion (Rs 19,000 crore)in a range of areas relating to infrastructure and renewable energy. And this, say Indian diplomats in the region, is only the beginning. In 2018, significant developments could also take place in southeast Asia, beginning with the Indo-ASEAN commemorative summit on January, followed by New Delhi hosting all the ASEAN leaders collectively as chief guests at the Republic Day function. Modi’s expected speech at the Shangrila Dialogue in Singapore in early June will be important because it is being delivered at Asia’s premier security meet. This could be a harbinger of deepening Indian commitments in the region to balance China’s activism in South Asia. Having faced down Beijing in Doklam, India is in a good position to engage Beijing. Not much will come from this because issues between the two are not open to quick resolution. In recent years, they have displayed a dangerous tendency not to respond to the numerous CBMs that have kept peace between the two countries in recent decades. We now need newer mechanisms simply to ensure things do not get out of hand. If things go well, we could well see an acceleration of the steadily increasing Chinese investments in India topped off by a visit by Chinese supremo, Xi Jinping. The Chinese understand well that India is a huge opportunity for them. We could well see a negotiated settlement of the Sino-Indian impasse over the Belt and Road Initiative. It is in the context of China that India also needs to pay attention to Russia in 2018. There has been significant activity on the official front in 2017, but a visit by President Putin for the annual consultative summit could restore some vitality to the relationship. Our most important tie will remain the one with the US. It will also be the most problematic. It has so far been Washington’s best managed foreign relationship, but it could rub up against Indian interests relating to Iran and Russia. However, there is every indication that the US is willing to give New Delhi considerable leeway here because its need for India’s weight in the “Indo Pacific” region is significant. And what about Pakistan? There is unlikely to be much of a shift here, considering Pakistan has no real government at present and, perhaps, more important, it remains a useful electoral tool for Modi. He is also likely to visit Davos for the World Economic Forum summit. At first sight, it looks like an attempt to catch up with Jinping who was the chief guest last year. Symbolic attendance at Davos won’t change things. The economy is not going anywhere for a while and Modi must take the blame for that. New Delhi does appear to be in a sweet spot of sorts because of American friction with Pakistan and China. This could grow, for differing reasons, in 2018. This can provide sufficient space to further India’s interests. This is where the rub comes in. It is now widely accepted that Indian economy slowed down on account of self-inflicted wounds in 2017. Hopefully, Modi and his team will not do a repeat in the arena of foreign policy.

The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didn’t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didn’t deny it either.

Gabbard, who represents a constituency in Hawaii, is not of Indian descent and neither of her parents are Hindu, but she practises Hinduism. Gabbard was born in 1981 in Leloaloa, American Samoa, the fourth of five children born to Carol and Mike Gabbard, a State Senator. In 2002, Gabbard became the youngest person ever to be elected to the Hawaii State Legislative, and in 2012, she was elected to the US House. She went on to win the general election by nearly 80 points. She is one of the first female combat veterans to serve in Congress, and she was deployed with the Hawaii National Guard to Iraq in 2005 and Kuwait in 2009. According to a report in , Gabbard became one of the most popular political figures after she broke with the Democratic Party establishment and endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton in 2016, even resigning as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in order to be able to do so. In 2004, Gabbard volunteered to join the 29 Brigade of US soldiers when they were called to war in Iraq. According to Gabbard’s website, “She (Gabbard) felt it was more important to stand in solidarity with her fellow soldiers than to climb the political ladder.” However, Gabbard’s critics have questioned her views on foreign policy and her tolerance of dictators like Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard came under attack after she met Assad in 2017. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Trapper, she said that she hadn’t planned on meeting him but when the opportunity arose, she did, because she felt it was important. Democratic leaders maintained silence on one of their leaders meeting a head of state who has been dubbed a war criminal by the US. Then, in April 2017, Gabbard’s stand on the chemical attack in Syria raised eyebrows again. According to an article in  , in 2015, Gabbard was among the Democrats who voted for restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She had also expressed “skepticism” about the widely held assertion that Assad’s government was behind chemical attacks in Syria. After the 2002 Gujarat riots, the US government had denied a visa to Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat at the time. Gabbard was one of the few to criticise the US government’s decision. According to an article in  , five months after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister of India, Gabbard opposed a resolution which called for “religious freedom and related human rights to be included in the United States-India Strategic Dialogue and for such issues to be raised directly with federal and state Indian government officials,” saying that it would weaken India-US relations. In August 2014, Gabbard made it a point to meet Modi in New York after his Madison Square Garden speech and presented him a copy of the  that she swore by when she was elected. Before that, in August 2014, speaking at a fundraising event for the BJP in Georgia, US, Gabbard had hailed Modi’s 2014 landslide victory and said, “People (of India) stood up, one by one by one by one, and said ‘we will demand that this change occurs’.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On Friday, 9 November, at a Medtronic conference in Los Angeles, eminent Indian-American Dr Sampat Shivangi introduced Gabbard, 37, and said that she could be the next president of the US in 2020. The brief statement was marked by a standing ovation, in the presence of the four-term Congresswoman from the 50th US State. Gabbard, a Democrat, didn’t confirm that she would be running for president in 2020, but she didn’t deny it either.

It is extremely unfortunate for the bureau, as it hosts officers of impeccable integrity. They would indeed feel disturbed and so would the citizens who frequently demand CBI investigation in complicated, sensitive and controversial crimes. Criminal cases against its former directors – Ranjit Sinha and AP Singh – to say nothing of the unceremonious transfer of its past Special Director Rupak Dutta, tipped to be the director in 2017 – are some of the recent instances that have cast a shadow over the bureau. But more so, on the procedure followed for selecting the top boss of the agency. In the process, merit is relegated to the back burner, as was in the case of the untimely transfer of Rupak Dutta to ‘accommodate’ the current incumbent Alok Verma, and the controversial induction/promotion of the Special Director Rakesh Asthana. The high-powered panel for the selection of the director of the CBI has as three members ie the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. Yet, two of its past directors have been tainted – they have been accused in criminal cases. It is thus a poignant comment on the selection procedure, and a travesty of the highest order. The CBI comes under the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT), thus directly under the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). It has a presence in most states in the country. The Bureau has also been notified as the Interpol of India for the purpose of liaison with police organisations of other countries, and to facilitate cooperation in international cases. There are two types of officers in the CBI – directly recruited officer investigators / support staff, and investigators and supervisors inducted on deputation from outside. The leadership lies with the Indian Police Service (IPS), with officers selected from all over the country. The CBI does not have a policy like the Intelligence Bureau (IB) or Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wherein the officers on deputation can get permanently absorbed. At any given time, there are about 20 percent and above vacancies, for various reasons like state police officers being unwilling to come on deputation etc. As per the CBI manual, the superintendent and above have specified powers for registration of cases, and the CBI follows it scrupulously. An officer of a particular rank can register an economic offence of a particular magnitude at his / her level, and to go above that, they need the permission of the rank above them. Similar guidelines on the basis of ranks exist for registering offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. There are legal advisers at each stage of investigation, and a follow-up of cases in courts is quite good. However, on occasion, the quality of its investigation and prosecution have been criticised by the courts as in the 2G spectrum allocation case recently. At other times, the courts have come down heavily on the CBI’s decisions, with the Supreme Court terming it as ‘caged parrot’ and ‘His master’s voice’. The internal vigilance wing has often nabbed some of its corrupt officers and prosecutors, proving that the CBI has its own black sheep. The pendency of cases however is mounting, despite special courts designated to handle CBI cases. These are issues of serious concern. In most cases, the investigation is of high standard, and the investigating officers are encouraged to pursue the collection of scientific evidence. The conviction rate is higher in CBI cases, as the investigating officers do not have to handle other departments like law and order / security/ VIP duties. They devote their full time to investigation. When I joined the Bureau in 1999, I was impressed by the depth of discussion and focus on investigation. I also found that the investigating officers took much longer to complete an investigation – some in the hope that more cases would not come their way if they go slow on the earlier ones! But by and large, the work culture and environment had been highly professional. During the '90s, the Bureau was given more resources, and the millennium saw special allowances – 25 percent of the pay for ranks up to the Superintendent of Police, and 15 percent, for ranks above it. The officers also feel that they do not have the facilities and amenities of local police investigation units. Still the conviction rate (of above 65 percent), is one of the best in the country. The more recently created National Investigation Agency (NIA) will take decades to come up to the benchmark set by the CBI. In most of the cases, the investigators work independently, but in some cases, there are pressures from different quarters. Most officers are able to withstand these pressures, as documentation is very strong within the CBI. If you are able to justify your stand on paper, it is difficult to be overruled. However, some officers do find cunning ways to bypass these, including taking legal opinion in their favour. Courts intervene occasionally and initiate direct supervision with clear direction not to transfer/shift the investigating officers and the supervisors – as was the case with the investigation of the 2G spectrum allocation case, and coal scam cases. With a professional work culture, a strong internal vigilance wing, and an internationally-acclaimed training set-up, the Central Bureau of Investigation holds its head high – more often than not. On the whole, having worked in the CBI, I can safely vouch for its professionalism, and fervently hope that the current director and special director resolve their differences for a higher cause, that is, the ethos of their organisation. Both officers being from the Indian Police Service, should stand up for the ‘service of the people’ and NOT for ‘the service of the party in power’.

But it is also equally true for the filmmakers themselves, who are often stuck in the past, unresponsive to the present environment, reacting to it only through memories. And then there are those filmmakers who receive an instant emotional blow from the socio-political situation of the present and hurl away the burden of the past to deliver a message for the present. His cinema can be divided into distinct periods, etching out the contemporary sensibilities of the times they were made in. My first experience of a Mrinal Sen film was of    which shows a young boy dying of suffocation on a winter night, in a middle-class Bengali household’s kitchen. I had seen   only too often — working in the houses of some of my friends, whom I would visit after school. Mrinal Sen’s    , which shows a film crew attempting to make a film based on the Bengal famine (set in a village of the day), fuses the horrors of history with the struggles of contemporary life. The classical structure of a ‘film within a film’ has been used by Sen to show how fiction and reality often converge. Durga, an ordinary village woman, who witnesses the film shoot, begins to empathise with a character portrayed in the film. The hardships faced by Durga in real life, and this character, are very similar. Mrinal Sen also depicts the exploitation of the innocent, ignorant villagers at the hands of the privileged film personalities. Sen made this film at a time when he wanted to study characters through a socio-political lens — understanding their responses, moral dilemmas, self-corruption and exploitation, which can then provoke the spectator to start a discussion. In dramas like   and  Sen sheds light on the moralities of the society of the day, especially exposing the so-called Bhadralok (gentleman) culture. In  , a middle-class family’s fate hangs in the balance as their eldest daughter, the sole breadwinner, fails to come home one night. Similarly, in  , the father, the family’s patriarch, goes missing. My understanding of Mrinal Sen completely changed once I went to college and got involved in the politics of the day. I had a lot to say, and I was ready to shout over the burst of other voices. Mrinal Sen started ‘shouting out his own politics’ with his cult-classic   at a time when the Naxalite movement was at its peak, and world cinema was highly influenced by the French New Wave and Czech New Wave. The film is highly stylised with use of freeze frames and stop-motion animation. An animation sequence builds up the character of Shome (who is mostly engrossed in office work) through pens, books, files, sheets, but without actually showing him. Thus, Sen developed a new language for Indian filmmakers, giving birth to the Indian New Wave. The period demanded that Sen shout out his views over ear-blasting bombings and cries of mothers of youths shot dead by police. Mrinal Sen’s   trilogy, a set of overly political films narrated in the new vocabulary of the day, also emerged around the same time. Sen breaks the fourth wall in  , and directly speaks to the camera.  and   the other two films in the  trilogy – both deal with questions of leadership and exploitation by the higher-ups. Sen used ‘juxtaposition’ as an important cinematic tool to jar the spectators out of the illusion of cinema. Mrinal Sen’s cinema has not only inspired other films, but also compelled other filmmakers to document his life and work. The creation of a new wave in Indian cinema, which was subsequently continued by the likes of Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, and Shyam Benegal, can be credited to Sen. Sen completely distrusts Ramani’s presence and his sensibilities — Sen’s aura, comes out with an absolute honesty in the final documentary, which in the last sequence, cuts to Sen watching himself on screen as Ramani shows him the footage for approval. Mrinal Sen, the ‘master’ smiles at his ‘other self’, jarred out of illusion into realism through his most favourite cinematic device of all — the ‘cut’. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 3 July 1995, Delhi woke up to a crime that was less gruesome in execution but was brutal enough when it came to removing evidence, including the victim’s body. In the post-liberalisation era, even as blaring 24*7 news channels were yet to arrive on the scene, few newspapers made sure that the readers had every salacious bit on their platter daily. The accused Sushil Sharma, a former Youth Congress leader, someone who was known for his proximity to senior leaders, had shot his wife dead and then tried to burn her body.  It was perhaps the sheer grit and dogged effort by Pereira and his team which ensured that Sharma was behind bars. But it wasn’t so easy for the Delhi Police that faced many challenges during investigation, as explained vividly by Pereira in his book,  . This observation was contrary to the claim by the police that Naina Sahni's death was caused due to injury caused by a bullet wound with the shot being fired from a very close range. The police had retrieved bullets and empty cartridges from Sushil Sharma's flat at Mandir Marg where traces of blood were found on the mattress in the bedroom. Just because the X-ray machine at the Lady Hardinge Medical College was non-functional and the body was burnt beyond recognition, the first autopsy report had overlooked the injury mark in the corpse caused by the bullets. It was the second autopsy report that favoured the sequence of events as was established by the Delhi Police in its probe. Pereira feels that such procedural hassles are part of the job for investigating officers: Speaking to  , Pereira also shared how important it was for the police force then in 1995 to win back the confidence of people. Sharma was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in 2007. On 8 October 2013, the Supreme Court commuted Sushil Sharma’s death sentence to life imprisonment. In its judgment, the bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India, P Sathasivam had  : The Court was of the view that chances of reformation of Sharma can’t be ruled out. Sushil Sharma has already served 23 years behind bars. So should he now be allowed to live a normal life outside jail on grounds of good behaviour? It was this question that resulted in a fierce debate between the author and audience at the book launch. A counselor at the Tihar Jail, who was present at the book launch, shared her experience of interacting with Sharma, as she claimed, “he regrets his action”. In 2016, the Supreme Court   that “a sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years”. Which means that the release of Sushil Sharma would be tough “unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentence”. According to Maxwell Pereira, “the police had done its job and now it’s up to the institutions who take decisions on such matters”. What happened to Constable Abdul Nazeer Kunju, the man, who was on night duty at the Connaught Place police station on 2 July 1995? It was Kunju who had rushed inside the Bagiya restaurant after a woman came out shouting,  It was Kunju who first spotted Sushil along with his friend Keshav as both were busy throwing pamphlets and posters into the fire. ‘He left the police service’, Pereira told the audience, when he was asked about Kunju. After his stint as the hero, who had helped in unravelling a gruesome crime, it was the slow pace of promotion in the hierarchical setup of the police that led to Kunju calling it quits. While Kunju was able to resist all the efforts of Sushil Sharma to intimidate him, the poor guy found it difficult to overcome disillusionment that dawned after years of performing his duties with utmost sincerity. Lack of motivation is perhaps among the many ills ailing the police force. Pereira still reminisces the ability of Kunju to react fast to an unwarranted situation, which in this case, led to the discovery of a charred body:       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

On 23 November 2005, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi were travelling by bus from Hyderabad to Sangli in Mahrashtra. While on the way, the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) stopped the bus and abducted the couple. Three days later, on 26 November, Sohrabuddin was shot dead in what the police called an encounter, but it was later found to be fake by the investigators. In total, several prosecution witnesses have deposed before the court since 29 November 2017. The same day, the special CBI court passed a gag order restraining media from reporting the case based on an application by the defence lawyer. On 24 January this year, the Bombay High Court struck down the gag order. According to sources, all hostile witnesses are crucial, and some of them are also eyewitnesses in the case.

But during cross-examination, Saleema denied even having met Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi. Saleema’s retraction of her earlier statement will impact the case because this raises questions over whether Sohrabuddin and his wife went to Hyderabad or boarded the bus to Sangli. Here are the names of some other hostile witnesses: According to the prosecution, key witnesses turning hostile is a major setback for the case. According to a legal expert: Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had boarded a luxury bus from Hyderabad to go to Sangli in Maharashtra at around 9 pm on 22 November 2005. But while they were on the way, a group of policemen from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh allegedly kidnapped them. A passenger inside the bus told the investigator that an SUV blocked their bus and three policemen with guns abducted Sohrabuddin and his wife. Kausar Bi refused to allow the police to take him, and so she too was abducted by the police. Based on the statements of some witnesses, Sohrabuddin and his wife were brought to Ahmedabad’s Disha Farm where both of them were illegally detained and later killed, according to the charge-sheet filed by the CBI. According to the Gujarat ATS, Sohrabuddin was a sharp shooter and had underworld connections. He had come to the city at the behest of the Lashker-e-Taiba and the ISI to assassinate a political leader. The Gujarat Police acted on the basis of an intelligence input from the Rajasthan Police, who were also part of the encounter team. The Gujarat Police also claimed that Sohrabuddin was wanted in an arms case in Madhya Pradesh and in a murder case in Rajasthan. According to the Gujarat police, Sohrabuddin was operating from Narol area in Ahmedabad, when the police spotted him riding a bike near the Vishala circle, they tried to intercept but he didn't stop. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sohrabuddin shot at policemen and in self-defence police retaliated, killing him. They offer no explanation for how Kausar Bi was killed. Some key witnesses who are yet to be cross-examined in court are:  once a close associate of Sohrabuddin, turned hostile from his earlier statement recorded before the CBI. In an affidavit before the designated CBI court, witness claimed that the statements attributed to him against the former Deputy Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, Abhay Chudasma, and others, were “taken by the investigating agency under duress.” He also charged the CBI with “acting on the instructions of Congress leaders of Gujarat.” In 2006,  the IPS officer of Gujarat cadre, was made the supervisory officer of the Sohrabuddin case before it was handed over to the CBI. Solanki’s investigation revealed that apart from Sohrabuddin, Kausar Bi was also killed as a coverup. This revelation led to the arrests of Gujarat-cadre IPS officers DG Vanzara and Rajkumar Pandian, and Dinesh MN of the Rajasthan cadre. Later, the CBI, in its findings, charge-sheeted Geetha Johri for allegedly botching up the investigation. The agency accused her of projecting that the third person abducted along with Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi was a person named Kalimuddin and not Tulsiram Prajapati. The first investigating officer of the Gujarat Police gave a statement to the CBI against  , saying she was working under pressure from now Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah. She botched-up the case by giving a false report stating that third person on the bus was not Tulsiram Prajapati. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

In a scathing critique, Pilot said of the incumbent Rajasthan government: It is believed that there is a strong sense of anti-incumbency on ground. So is it Modi who will have to step in to salvage Raje’s government? Pilot goes on to say, “So, today if Modi and Amit Shah go and campaign for the BJP in Rajasthan, they have to account for the last 4 and a half years of Vasundhara ji’s government. So it’s not easy to cover-up the misdeeds of Raje’s government and then ask for 5 more years. People have to know where the performance was.” From the large turnout, it seems that Vasundhara Raje’s ‘Gaurav Yatra’ was a success. What are your thoughts on this? This yatra that she is doing now is basically a face-saving exercise. As I keep saying, as opposed to ‘Gaurav Yatra’, Raje should have taken out a ‘Pashchatap Yatra’. She must atone for the sins she has committed as chief minister in the last 4 and a half years. And now Vasundhara ji, to counter the Congress’s work, is taking out this Gaurav Yatra, which is on government expense. It’s illegal, it’s immoral to use taxpayers’ money to do a political yatra. BJP is a rich party. Why is Vasundhara Raje not using the BJP’s money to organise meetings? “Today, the Rajasthan government is paying for the tent, loudspeakers, for ferrying people, for all the expenses of the party meetings, which Amit Shah had launched. So I think they are misusing the taxpayers' money, and that too for political purposes. People are watching all this very carefully. And the people who are coming out to listen to Raje are not going to vote for her. They were brought there because the government machinery was fully deployed,” continued Sachin Pilot. Is the Congress’s counter-narrative to Raje’s aggressive campaigns strong enough? There was no BJP president for 2 and a half months in Rajasthan. At that time, we (Congress party) went to the rural parts of Rajasthan, and out of 200 constituencies, we had ‘mera booth, mera gaurav’ programmes in 196. 50,000 booths, booth workers identifying them, linking them to the ‘Shakti’ project, and really, giving them political tasks. That was done at the grassroots and the booth-level. That’s what we did in the summer. Pilot added, “We (Congress) are doing ‘Sankalp’ rallies across Rajasthan. Rahul Gandhi came on 11 August and did a massive roadshow in Jaipur. We have a rally on 28 August and on 5, 10 and 12 September. So our campaign is fully on the ground.” Is the Congress likely to fall into the trap of complacency in Rajasthan? We are getting tremendous traction and without sounding immodest, I want to say that, I believe that the feedback we’ve gotten so far, the reactions, the attendance people have marked; young people in urban areas, rural areas are coming in hordes to show their faith in the Congress. So it’s a very positive indication, and I’m very confident that in December, when the elections happen, we’ll be able to secure a historic mandate. Why should Rajasthan vote for the Congress? 150 farmers have committed suicide. For the first time in Rajasthan, so many farmers are killing themselves. And here, Raje is taking out Gaurav Yatras when women are getting raped, farmers are committing suicide, young people are jobless. So this sort of situation is untenable. People want a change, and they want a positive change. And that’s where I think the Congress party’s role is very, very crucial. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Even as the TDP MLA was jailed, a tape was produced (and leaked to TV channels) where a voice suspiciously similar to that of Chandrababu Naidu’s, was found saying something incriminating. This was an opportunity for KCR’s Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) to poach TDP MLAs who Naidu had told to fend for themselves. At the same time, to ensure that Andhra industrialists did not flee to Andhra Pradesh leaving Hyderabad high and dry, KCR appointed his son KT Rama Rao (KTR) to woo them. The savvy KTR, who is IT and Urban Development Minister in KCR’s government, was able to win the confidence of these industrialists who were at the receiving end during the Telangana statehood movement. Naidu is hailed as the father of modern Hyderabad, who got Microsoft and other IT investments. But KTR is following in his footsteps and has been able to woo many others. “Hyderabad is a boom town now,” is the refrain of investors. Although he is believed to have strategised Naidu’s victory in 1999, Naidu jettisoned KCR, relegating him to the post of the Assembly’s deputy speaker. A miffed KCR left TDP and formed TRS to fight for a separate state. The new state was created by Sonia Gandhi on the eve of the 2014 elections. Before Telangana was announced, KCR had declared his allegiance to Sonia — who he said was like his own ‘mother’ and even promised to merge his party into the Congress if ‘he was given a free hand.’ But none of this happened, and the TRS and Congress are now arch rivals. Even as KCR wants to decimate the Congress, analysts aver that he has a tacit understanding with the BJP because this is what the saffron party also wants. However, in April 2017, KCR got a bill passed in the Telangana Assembly to provide reservations to backward Muslims in colleges and for jobs. This is unlikely to be notified by the central government, because reservations on religious basis have been struck down by the courts. Moreover, with the latest proposals, total reservations will go way beyond the constitutionally mandated upper limit of 50 percent. KCR, who runs the state with an iron hand and has promoted his daughter and nephew besides his son, is seen as a wily politician with a clear game plan in mind. This is why he is being taken seriously as he unfolds the federal front plan. K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is a man known for setting his goals high. Figuring that the ‘Modi magic’ of 2014 has all but vanished and has not been replaced by a Rahul Gandhi upsurge, KCR is fancying his chances as the next prime minister of India, suggest highly-placed sources. Donning the robe of a messiah, KCR has been announcing that “People are vexed that there is no qualitative change, even after 70 years of democracy.” KCR, as has been reported, travelled to Kolkata to confabulate with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for forming a federal front. He has also met CPM’s Sitaram Yechury with the same idea. The leaders of many likely federal front partners with more seats (like Mamata with 42 seats in West Bengal) might harbour prime ministerial ambitions themselves. But KCR, with his proficiency in both Hindi and English, and being from south India, feels that he has an edge over others (What does the first-time woman voter want?

As the Legislative Assembly goes to polls on 7 December, narratives of families of farmer suicides in the prosperous Nalgonda district, highlight how little their life has changed. Nalgonda has the highest number of farmer suicides, according to data available since the state’s formation. Kathula Venkataiah, 45, committed suicide like thousands of farmers do every year in India, because of crop failure and unpaid debts. But this farmer suicide was different. A resident of Manimadde village of Shali Gowraram mandal in Nalgonda district, Venkataiah was a staunch supporter of the separate state of Telangana. He had participated in village marches and believed that Telangana’s statehood would be the best solution for the rural distress he himself faced, and witnessed around him. And yet, he killed himself 12 days after the formation of Telangana on 2 June 2014. Inability to repay debt was the main reason for Venkataiah’s suicide; he had owed Rs 4,30,000 at the time of his death, according to official documents. As Venkataiah did not own land, banks had trouble lending to him, and he borrowed from private moneylenders on an interest of Rs 1.50 to Rs 2. This dependence on private moneylenders is despite over 83 percent rural access to bank credit, according to the same report. Further, government schemes like Rythu Bandhu, are meant for farmers who cultivate their own land, and not for tenant/landless farmers who are the worst affected by distress. A report by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with TISS in 2018, finds that 20 percent of land in the state is cultivated by tenant farmers, but they account for 75 percent of farmer suicides in Telangana. The children of tenant farmers face a different challenge; there is no land to farm, and education does not lead to employment. Even with 64.2 percent literacy rate, Nalgonda district has only 49.9 percent working population, according to the 2011 Census. It is not surprising therefore, that after Venkataiah’s death, all his three children dropped out of school to earn a livelihood instead. In Manimadde village, where the family met this reporter this week, they live in a half-constructed two-room house of cement and brick. Part of the state compensation paid after Venkataiah’s death had gone into building the house, but was not enough to finish it. In another part of Nalgonda in Chandanpally village, Rupani Radha recalls the death of her husband, Janayya, in November 2014, four months after the formation of Telangana state. She now supports three children between the ages of 8-14 years, through farm labour, and by cultivating cotton on 2 acres of rain-fed land that used to belong to her husband. The land is now in the name of her 8-year-old son, transferred by her husband’s family after his death. This has proved a hurdle for getting benefits of government schemes as her son is not of age. Welfare had failed to assist her in times of need. For instance, when she had to undergo a surgery for kidney stones in June 2018, she had to borrow Rs 1 lakh from private sources. She says that the free health scheme ‘Aarogyasri’ would have taken time to come though, and she could not wait. And now, after the surgery, the loan has added to her burden as she is unable to do farm labour to repay it. Radha’s only other option is agriculture. “I must work as farm labour to pay for the cotton crop on our field. I have harvested about 5 quintals, which will fetch me about Rs 20,000, but I will make no profit,” she says. But like Narsamma, even Radha must reconcile to the indifference of the state that no longer needs the farmer, except perhaps, during elections.  ‘ ’ by        (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Founded in 1959, by C Rajagopalachari, one of India’s greatest political thinkers and leaders, as well as literary giants, Swatantra Party arrived on the Indian political scene with a bash. The archive features correspondences, office memorandums, meeting minutes, speech drafts, party literature and publications, and many personal notes shared by the party leaders, allowing us a glimpse into the life of the party as it was conceived, formed, and introduced to the larger Indian political scene. A small correspondence between Indira Gandhi and MR Masani, notes shared by Masani and Rajaji are among the many treasures housed in the archive. In the letter issued from the Prime Ministers Office on 12 March 1967, Indira Gandhi invites Mr Masani to join her in an informal meeting with parliamentary leaders, before the inaugural session of Lok Sabha. The letter reads: “I write this to invite you to an informal meeting of Leaders of different Parties in Parliament so that we have an opportunity of meeting one another on the eve of the session and to exchange views on matters of common interest. I should like to maintain similar contact throughout the session if you find the idea appropriate and useful. I wonder if we could have our first meeting at 10 am on 15th March in my office in Parliament House. I hope you will find it convenient to join.” A handwritten note by C Rajagopalachari, addressed to Mr Homi Mody, a lawyer, administrator, businessman, and social reformer is another valuable find. Homi, a moniker for Sir Hormasji Pherozshah Modi, held a variety of public offices as Chairman of Bombay Municipal Corporation (1913), a member of Indian legislative assembly (1929-1943), a member of Viceroy’s Executive Council (1943), a member of Constituent Assembly of India, and governor of United Provinces and Uttar Pradesh (1949-52). In the note C Rajagopalachari expresses his gratitude to Mody for leading the early collection efforts to establish the corpus of funds for the party. Written on 20 October 1959 – Swatantra's founding year – the note states, “It was kind of you to write and give a cheerful account of the collection work. I had intended to write to our staff about the need for active assistance but as I have just read your letter, I feel it is unnecessary. I cannot tell you how greatly I feel heartened by your continued support. Tyranny cannot be brought to an end until the victims shed fear. Our 'friends' are going to get more and more autocratic and dictatorial seeing that we are gathering strength...” The archive has been successfully restored and digitised by the efforts of the Centre for Civil Society as a part of its Indian Liberals digital archive project, and will be placed at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library for public engagement, and will soon be available on the open Indian Liberal website for visitors. According to Rajaji, a liberal democracy rests on four pillars, or feet: an active citizenry, prudent statesmen, a responsible parliament, and independent judiciary. The party was Rajaji’s response to the rise of what he saw as the ‘one-footed’ democracy—a monolithic Congress system, which had erupted due to the absence of a sustained and principled opposition, and a fractured electoral system which rewarded expensive campaigns mounted by those in power with subsequent victories. Rajaji’s greatest concern was the rise of majoritarianism, which he felt was eroding the democratic nature of our public institutions. Congress’ eclipsing victories at national and state level in the 1950s, the abuse of ordinances by the Nehru Government in the early 1950s as a means to subvert scrutiny by both houses, the misuse of Ninth Schedule to overcome judicial review, and the increase in instances of agitation and boycott by Parliamentarians troubled Rajaji, for they threatened to erode the sanctity of institutional procedures. Writing on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in 1963, he argued “democracy in a pluralist society is sustained not by force of numbers but by the vital force of trust, the maintenance of which must, therefore be the greatest concern of statesmen guiding democracies.” No less than a year old, it commanded the presence of many of India’s greatest statesmen and thinkers. M R Masani, Dahyabhai Patel (son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), Sir Homi Mody, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, VP Menon, Maridas Ruthnaswamy, N G Ranga, and more. The party boasted of a wide and diverse leadership, bringing together voices from the South as well as Northern India, peasant and agrarian activists and aristocrats on one platform. The party had offices and regional centres in Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, and Patna, with units in Himachal Pradesh, UP, Bengal, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. It was the only national party to not have an office in Delhi, and this was done to ensure candidates and party leaders stayed close to their respective constituencies. The party also held one of the few female members of royal families to participate in electoral politics: Maharani Gayatri Devi, who campaigned relentlessly for the party in the 1962 elections. While the party performed well in the general elections of 1962 and 1967, it could not withstand the rising forces of extremism and majoritarianism in the 1970s, and floundered after Rajaji’s demise in 1974 – only a few months before the imposition of Emergency.

He is the son of Jaswant Singh, a tall Rajpur leader who, despite being one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party, was denied a ticket to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. This battle for Manvendra is a personal one that he did not want to fight in the first place. Vasundhara Raje has been winning from this seat for three consecutive terms, and the margin she is winning by has also steadily increased from 27,000 in 2003 to 61,000 votes in 2013. What do you think will work in your favour? I think every election is a different situation. Particularly in 2018, where the politics of Rajasthan has taken a huge turn. There is an underswell against a particular kind of governance, which is palpable under the surface across the state. Coming here, I feel the underswell is also covered with a huge campaign against tyranny. All polls have predicted a Congress win in the state, sir. You are Jaswant Singh’s son, you have won before, you are politically relevant in Mewar. So, would it have been better for you to stand from Barmer as opposed to here, where you are contesting against somebody who has  a political legacy here for 30-35 years, and has been an MLA here for three consecutive terms? Certainly it would have been better to stand from the Barmer-Jodhpur side, but that is if I wanted to contest and I did not want to contest. So that question is not so connected to me because it is a question for the will to win, I mean, the will to contest, which I didn’t have. An offer like this, as the quote says from   the movie, “Make an offer I cannot refuse.” So yeah, they made an offer I couldn’t refuse. All polls say the Congress will win. You could have stood from a lot of other seats where anti-incumbency is strong, where leaders are not so strong, but they put you here, where there is a good chance that you might lose. Sure, I am realistic about it. I am not being romantic about the results. I am realistic about the situation. But don’t you think there could have been an easier gateway to being an MLA if it was from a different place? If they really truly wanted you to be representative... I don’t think you should find a conspiracy. There is a conspiracy in the question. There is no conspiracy in my nomination from here. In case you lose, is there something they (the Congress) have promised they’ll give you despite that? I am not in a situation... My fondness for Rahul Gandhi does not permit me to have a bargaining power. Why are you fond of him, sir? We became MPs together and we continued to be in touch. I’ve seen him grow as he has a (sense of) responsibility, which most of us do not have. I have seen him grow into responsibility. People generally tend to vote for a probable CM candidate from a constituency  , they automatically come on the map. Do you think that might work against you as well? It may. It may also work to my advantage. Sir, it sounds like... Do you think you might lose?  I hope not. It could also work to my advantage. This is an uphill task for you, when Jaswant Singh sir was not given the ticket for the 2014 LS polls, it wasn’t good for the Rajputs of Mewar, to say one thing. Do you think if you lose this, you will be able to survive the political game? I’m sure I will. The goodwill is flowing enormously from everywhere across spectrum of communities. Your wife has accompanied you on the campaign trail, does she like it? Do you have fights about it later in the evening? No, we do not have fights like that, but like all women, she does not like surprises. Surprise gifts are okay, but you can’t be surprised with an election campaign like this. So she was not happy being surprised like that. What was the surprising factor? The fact that we didn’t ask for a ticket, I mean, nobody wanted. People wanted someone to contest from the family, but I was not keen on contesting. You were expecting her – your wife, Chitra Singh – of contesting from here. Why do you think she is a good fit for the region? A, because her village is not very far from here, in that sense, she is a geographical neighbour and a cultural neighbour in an immediate sense. And more than anything else, because she is a woman, she has an extra allowance, which I don’t have. If you lose, sir, would you be upset with the Congress for making you stand from here? No, not at all. This should not be seen as a conspiracy, but as a gesture which has great significance. Rajasthan votes on 7 December and the results will be out on 11 December.

The ED had also brought on the record that the three middlemen \"managed to\" make inroads into the Indian Air Force (IAF) to influence the stand of officials to reduce the service ceiling of the helicopters from 6,000 metres to 4,500 metres in 2005, according to PTI. AgustaWestland became eligible to supply the dozen helicopters for VVIP flying duties after this change. Moreover, according to ED investigation, remittances made by Michel through his Dubai-based firm Global Services to a media firm he floated in Delhi, along with two Indians, were made from the funds which he got from AgustaWestland through “criminal activity” and corruption being done in the chopper deal, reported PTI. In July 2018, after he was granted bail in Dubai, Michel had accused Indian investigators of pressuring him to name UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and frame senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel in return for a clean chit in the multi-crore scam. On 19 July, while he was in custody, his lawyer Rosemary Patrizi had made similar charges against the Indian probe agencies, although CBI had denied the allegations.

As ruling Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) is busy promising welfare schemes to farmers, he has competition brewing in the opposition camp. Congress leader Uttam Kumar Reddy has filed his nomination in his home ground, the Huzurnagar constituency, and many say he could be the chief ministerial candidate floated by the grand alliance. The rally saw hundreds of people dancing, flags waving, loud sloganeering and   (folk dance). caught up with the Congress leader to find out how he plans to defeat the KCR government this time. In a candid conversation, Reddy said that he hopes their party doesn’t repeat any of these mistakes. “This time, we have been far more careful and hopefully those mistakes won't be repeated. I am fairly sure that the people's front we have formed now – Congress-TDP-CPM-TJS – we will win the elections with an overwhelming majority,” said Reddy. He criticised the ruling government for failing farmers, youth and women. “He promised something and didn’t do it. He looted the state. He has been an oppressive dictator, trying to suppress people's rights. I think he has been exposed now,” he added. He alleged that the chief minister’s move to dissolve the Telangana Assembly was a conspiracy. On 6 September 2018, KCR recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for early elections. He had said that he was doing it in the interests of the state, and that he wanted to curb the state’s political fragility. However, Reddy said he suspects the early election has been a result of a conspiracy between PM Narendra Modi, the Election Commission, and KCR. He said there was no other explanation for how the schedule announced by KCR was exactly the same as what was announced by the Election Commission. Reddy was a former fighter pilot and served as the Comptroller of Security, Protocol, Administration, Foreign Trips of the President at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. He is a four-time MLA and a former minister of Housing. Reddy said his agenda, if elected to power, would be to introduce farm loan waivers, unemployment toll, financial incentives to women’s self-help groups, and remunerative prices for farmers to purchase crops. If Congress wins, Reddy could become the chief minister – but when asked, he chooses to leave it to Rahul Gandhi. “I have no such ambitions. My limited role is to lead the Congress party this election. And I think I will do that successfully. The next step is in the hands of Rahul Gandhi,” he said.

Tasked with guarding borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, the force has a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of nation. 53 years ago, policy makers conceived of a force capable of guarding borders during peace, and to assist the army as the first line of defence during hostilities, because of the inability of the disparate State Armed Forces to stand up to even minor threats from Pakistani forces, and lack of uniformity in dealing with its counterparts. The force has grown from about 25,000 in 1965, to about 2.5 lakhs now. This mammoth growth has been in spurts, causing many problems of human resource management. The policy planners erred in ensuring a smooth phased expansion to prevent the personnel management dilemma that the force is now faced with. However, the one-time benefits of such rapid expansion has reached its saturation point, and the personnel are now stagnating for long periods, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralisation. A  takes anything from 20 to 24 years to earn his first promotion. The situation of the cadre officers of the force has always been precarious, with most of them retiring at the middle rungs. Efforts to address the problem of stagnation have lacked vision, and amounted only to fire fighting. For example, in order to bring parity with the police, the ranks of Lance Naik were abolished, thus disturbing the rank structure of a “section” which is the basic sub-unit. Similarly, the introduction of the rank of assistant sub inspector has disturbed the structure of “platoon”. The cadre review exercise for officers has, without aiming for long-term solutions, resulted only in one-time postponement of stagnation through proliferation of ranks in the battalions. Avenues created at higher levels do not accrue to cadre officers because of the rule position, and these have been usurped by IPS officers. He frequently encounters life-threatening situations, but is now not entitled to pension which his counterpart in defence forces get. Large numbers of BSF units are deployed on the Line of Control, and perform the same duties as the Army. Yet, he gets almost 25 percent less than his Army counterpart. Further, in case of an unfortunate death in the line of duty, the family of a deceased BSF soldier is deprived of many benefits available to the family of an Army Jawan, because there is no provision for a BSF soldier to be declared a martyr. BSF personnel spend most of their life on BOPs where the extended duty hours – sometimes 16 per day, enable only an interrupted sleep. To make matters worse, the living conditions at most of the BOPs are unsatisfactory. A recent report stated that out of the 66 BOPs in Barmer sector of BSF, only two had facilities for piped drinking water. The rest depended upon water tankers. The above conditions coupled with the inability to meet urgent family obligations, cause a lot of stress, resulting in a high rate of attrition. As per a reply to a parliament question, 11,192 BSF personnel have either resigned or proceeded on voluntary retirement from 2015 up-to Jan 2018. The prevalent security environment now – both internal and external – is vastly different from that in 1965. The proxy war by Pakistan has kept our western borders troubled, requiring aggressive border management practices. The Bangladesh border grapples with a threat of a different kind, with armed cattle smugglers attacking BSF soldiers, when intercepted. Heavy population density, lack of development and employment opportunities makes these borders highly crime prone. The BSF is thus faced with the policy dilemma of averting use of force to conform to the national objective of maintaining good relations with Bangladesh, and ensuring the safety and security of soldiers, while preventing crime. Man-power intensive border guarding practices are no longer adequate, and suitable technology has to be introduced to assist border men. Technological interventions in the shape of first and second generation NVDs have had a rather limited effect, and the situation on ground remains unchanged. These devices, besides having out lived their life, are cumbersome and  user-friendly. The organisation also has not invested in familiarizing troops with the usage of these devices, which is another reason for reluctance on the part of troops to use them. The technology sought to be introduced is generally vendor-driven, which more often than not, fails on ground. Trials must be carried out over an extended period in operational conditions before induction. Aspects of training in their use, maintenance etc must also be built in the contract to prevent long turn over time for repairs. Proper facilities should be created at BOPs to derive optimum advantage from devices like Thermal Imagers. Annual competition to encourage innovation remains just an event, and none of the projects have been taken up for large scale production to ease the burden on troops. The mindset of the commanders therefore, requires a generational change, as the constabulary now is educated and well-informed. To be able to adopt “smart border management” practices they should be encouraged to come up with innovative ideas and adequate training in use of technical gadgets introduced in the force. The training philosophy also needs to orient itself with the present day operational environment. While western borders need aggressive domination and “Ek goli ek dushman” type of training is still relevant, the eastern borders require troops to exercise restraint. This must therefore be incorporated in the basic induction training, and also when troops get deployed in those areas. Frequent deployment in counter-insurgency operations also necessitates incorporation of these aspects in the training. As mentioned above, border guarding is rapidly transforming into integrated border management where several agencies are equal stake holders. Borders will, in the near future, transform from barriers to bridges between nations. A smart border man therefore has to be aware of the developing scenario and understand the functioning of different agencies involved with the functioning of “integrated check posts” and “land custom stations” to facilitate the hassle-free movement of personnel and goods across the borders. Trained in policing duties, they are unable to come to grips with the complexities a large organisation like the BSF, and the dynamics of border management. The government has to give a serious thought and rectify this anomalous situation by handing over the baton to cadre officers, who, over the years, have acquired enough experience and maturity to take up the responsibility.

On Monday, 26 November, Indian Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh laid the foundation stone at the Indian side at Dera Baba Nanak, three kilometers from the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak spent the last 17 years of his life. If this project reaches fruition by next November, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, it could mark a seachange in relations between arch rivals India and Pakistan. It could also set a precedent for the role religion can play to bring peace among erstwhile enemy nations and become a clarion call for peace in South Asia. Perhaps the most common critique of all religions is Karl Marx's phrase: opiate of the masses. The fact is that this phrase follows a longer sentence in which Marx describes the value of religion in human society. “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opiate of the people.” Since Marx’s utterance, while bashing religion, we often forget the value of religion and pick only its negative consequences. There are good reasons for it. There are umpteen examples of how communalism spreads, how politicians use religion to divide society, how competitive one-upmanship leads to violence, pogroms, riots and sectarianism. The Partition of India and Pakistan is considered the greatest exile in human history. It caused one million deaths and 14 million displacements. Ordinary people turned looters and plunderers. Even neighbours turned against each other – all in the name of religion. For the Hindu and Muslim populations, the Partition caused loss of a sense of belonging to their birth and natural environments and devastated their economies. For the Sikhs, who opposed Partition, the event also caused separation from some of their most significant religious places, including the place of birth and passing away of their founder, Guru Nanak. The Sikhs prayers include the  performed in the presence of the  or for various small and big ceremonies. The  has three parts. The first and third part are fixed but the second part can be changed to suit the occasion. After 1947, the Sikhs included the following text in the second part of their  : “ ” entres of religion, from which we have been separated.” For 71 years now, in spite of how New Delhi and Islamabad define the relationship between India and Pakistan, the Sikhs have been making the prayer to unite with their Gurdwaras. The developments this week seemed impossible just three months ago when Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Pakistan and hugged their Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had proposed the corridor. The nationalist television studios, ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), called him a ‘traitor’. Sidhu was abused and mocked. Today, the same Indian government is supporting the corridor. The BJP, which has made ‘hate Pakistan’ its major agenda, would have never agreed for such a project, but came in to glorify its beleaguered alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal. The cynical propaganda against the corridor shows how far the national narrative is from both east and west Punjab whose people share language, culture, deep bonds and have always aspired for peace. The national discourse does not get a simple fact: when two Punjabis meet, they hug as a way of greeting each other. It does not get it that former cricket stalwarts Imran Khan and Navjot Sidhu seek to re-write history. Guru Nanak says: “ ” “If you yearn to play love/enter with your head on your palm.” It is that moment for India and Pakistan. The call is whether we – both nations – want to play love, in this context with our neighbour. To fall apart, the proposal just needs: The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was freely accessible until the 1960s. In the early 2000s, Pakistan made an attempt to open access, but was thwarted by the Indian government. The SAD was in power, and SGPC was in control. That is why, since then, people have been having the   through binoculars at the Border Security Force post at Dera Baba Nanak. It is set to change now. If this project succeeds, it may lead to access to other 194 Gurdwaras included in the Sikh Ardas. It may lead to better trade and cultural ties between the two Punjabs and nations. Most of all, it would lead to demilitarisation of two poverty-stricken nations and better spending on education, health-care and employment. Certainly those are what people of both nations seek from their governments. It is a razor’s edge. As we say in Punjab:      (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Well-informed sources say there has been much criticism within the government, even at the highest level, of the way things have been handled. Home Minister Rajnath Singh and some in the national security establishment are said to be most displeased. Governor Satya Pal Malik, who is in the eye of the storm, even said on Wednesday, 28 November, that he might be transferred. If that indeed happens, it would be the result of his frequent public statements. Malik’s stating that the Centre wanted him to install Sajjad Lone as the chief minister, has been damaging to both Lone and those in charge at the Centre. Associates of Lone, whose People’s Conference party has two MLAs in the house, have even said that this could get him killed. BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav is the putative strategist who seems to have miscalculated. It was his plan that there should be a period of governor’s rule in J&K, during which the state’s administration should be cleaned up, and then a government of his choice would be installed. Amid the heartburn and criticism within the government over the past few days, top leaders have apparently made it clear that they were not party to some of the more sordid aspects of what has transpired. For instance, Mufti has alleged that central agencies such as the NIA have been misused to coerce MLAs. Lone’s associates have been very hopeful that he would be installed with the support of the BJP’s 25 MLAs and breakaway groups from the PDP, the Congress, and the National Conference. Their hopes were on a roller-coaster since July, but remained intact until last week. Their plans were overturned by the surprise move by three of the four substantial parties in the house (the other being the BJP) to form a government together. The move, which had been in the works over the previous few days, became public last Wednesday, 21 November. The house was dissolved that evening. Given the unseemly haste, it is unlikely that anyone focussed on the fact that the proposed alliance of three major parties would have been just short of two-thirds majority in the house. But the fact is that, with the help of a couple of single members, they could have attempted to amend the state’s constitution. On the other hand, the claim by the three parties acting in tandem could not be faulted. Yet, the governor initially described it as an ‘unholy alliance’. Pointing out that no formal claim had reached him, he asserted that he had played fair by not inviting either group. The three parties had come together after initial discussions at a meeting in London. The idea gathered steam even though NC leader Omar Abdullah was initially unhappy. Naturally! His party is set to gain from the general disappointment with the PDP’s governance in Kashmir. No wonder Omar has called for fresh elections since the day the BJP withdrew support to the PDP-led government in July.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Is this a mere coincidence or there is something else going on here? Here’s a little philosophy around electoral bonds: On 1 February 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley declared that the donations received by political parties henceforth will not be in cash, but in the form of electoral bonds. However, the details of the donor and the receiver of this bond will be confidential. It's commonly believed that the party predicted to win the elections receives the maximum funds, in anticipation of the benefits that will accrue once the party gains power. This is the very basis of the corruption that takes place in government. An   by  ’s Poonam Agarwal revealed that electoral bonds have a hidden alphanumeric code printed on them to track down the link between donors and political parties. This apparent manoeuvring by the government poses a critical question – in the name of increased ‘transparency’ in political funding with the introduction of electoral bonds, are we being subjected to unprecedented levels of secret surveillance? Electoral bonds were promised to be anonymous as no one other than the donors themselves are supposed to know which political party they are contributing to. ’s investigation reveals that while the public will remain clueless about who has donated to which party, the government has access to those details, collated through alphanumeric codes on the electoral bonds, which are invisible to the naked eye. This adds to the government’s already burgeoning repository of data, which now may not only have details of our bank accounts and financial transactions, but also our likely political preferences.

This is how the BJP candidate Yoonus Khan is pitching himself in his electoral fight against Rajasthan Congress Chief Sachin Pilot for the Tonk seat in the state assembly polls. Khan, Transport and PWD Minister in the Vasundhara Raje government, has been fielded by the BJP in the Muslim-dominated Tonk assembly constituency, replacing the party's sitting MLA Ajit Singh Mehta after the Congress gave a ticket to Pilot in Tonk. Talking to PTI while campaigning in the rural areas of Tonk, Khan said the decision to field him was based on strategy and equations, and not on his religion. Asked about being the lone Muslim candidate of the BJP and if his nomination marked a departure from the party's strategy to not field any candidates from the minority community, he said: \"I don't know about elsewhere, but in Rajasthan, Yoonus Khan and (late BJP leader) Ramzan Khan have been fighting polls since the 80s.\" Khan said he has been the party's lone Muslim candidate once earlier also. Asked if Tonk having a large number of Muslims was one of the reasons behind his candidature, the BJP leader said the election here will be on the basis of performance and agenda. \"The election will be on who can serve Tonk better. I have given my vision... As a minister I connected Sawai Madhopur road to a two-lane road. I have given a bypass.”, he said. He also vowed to solve the problem of drinking water faced by the residents of Tonk. Pitching himself as an underdog in the high-stakes electoral battle, Khan took a swipe at his Congress rival and said, \"He (Pilot) has come for the first time, I have been a minister for long...I know the workers here.\" \"For Sachin   it is a new place, people are new and apart from his dream to become an MLA and chief minister, he does not have any other dream. I am a people's servant. You can make me serve in Deedwana (his earlier constituency) and you can make me work in Tonk,\" Khan said. Khan said Pilot was the one who has been switching constituencies, while he has been fighting from the Nagaur district (under which Deedwana falls) and has come here now on the party's instructions.

Tonk also needs a sevak not a 'pilot', he said. In another jibe at the Rajasthan Congress chief's surname, Khan asked the crowd: \"Do you have an aeroplane. Do you have a helicopter?... No, then you don't need a pilot.\" Talking to PTI, he acknowledged both he and Pilot were outsiders in Tonk, but there was one difference – \"through the power that I had in my pen (as a minister), I have given roads worth Rs 2,000 crore.\" On the Congress' charge that Khan's ticket was cut from Deedwana and was finally given one from Tonk because of his religion, he said the opposition party gives statements according to its convenience. Asked if the contest in Tonk was as keen as the one in Jhalrapatan between Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress candidate Manvendra Singh, who was earlier with the saffron party, Khan said it was on-sided contest there and \"Vasundhara ji will defeat him by about 1.25 lakh votes.” (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The FIR named four persons as accused – Sonia Dhawan, an employee of Paytm and personal secretary of Vijay; Roopak Jain, Sonia’s husband; Devinder Kumar, Paytm employee; and Rohit Chomwal, a businessman from Kolkata. The FIR doesn’t reveal the nature of the data stolen nor has Sharma commented on the nature the data.

Dr Ajay Pal Sharma, Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Budh Nagar district has confirmed to  that the stolen data is related to Vijay Shekhar Sharma’s personal life.

Noida Police has claimed that a CD was recovered from one of the accused which allegedly contains stolen data. The CD has been sent for Forensic examination. The FIR accessed by  reveals that Chomwal was a key player. He was directly communicating with Vijay and Ajay through WhatsApp calls and messages. The FIR says, It was he who demanded Rs 10 crore as ransom and also informed the complainants about his other accomplices. Sonia’s lawyer refused to divulge the details of the data as the matter is subjudice. A small part of the ransom money was transferred into Chomwal’s bank account in two tranches, Rs 67 and Rs 2 lakhs, on 10 and 15 October, respectively.

The police has not clarified what evidence they have against Sonia, Roopak and Devinder to prove their involvement in the case. Is Chomwal so foolish that he will agree on the transfer of the ransom money to his bank account which can act as an evidence against him in the court? The FIR reveals that the first ransom call was made by Chomwal on 20 September but the complaint was filed on 22 October. Why did the complainant wait for 32 days to file a complaint? Why did Vijay and his brother transfer Rs 2 lakh to Chomwal’s bank account and then file a complaint? Was it to create evidence? Well, the FIR says that they already had Chomwal’s WhatsApp calls and messages as evidence. Sonia’s lawyer said that she was regularly attending office between 20 September and 22 October, during the period when Chomwal was blackmailing Vijay. Her lawyer claimed that there would be enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage to prove her presence in the office.

He says that the first Swaminathan commission report was submitted in 2004 – and the last in 2006 – which means that “in 14 years, Parliament has not found the time to discuss the report.” We also need to discuss the water crisis in the country, which is not just limited to droughts, he added. “Senseless utilisation of resources is taking place. There are massive transfers of water from agriculture to industry, from village to the city, from food crop to cash crop, etc,” Sainath says. Sainath says that there is also a need to engage with, and uphold the rights and needs of those who do the greatest amount of work in agriculture: The women farmers – both landed and landless. He said that another major differentiation of this protest was how seriously “the middle class is now taking the issues of farmers, after almost 20 years of indifference.” “Be it Mumbai, Nashik or Delhi... doctors, teachers, and students from universities all over the country have come out in support of the farmers,” he says. Sainath has been mobilising support for the farmers' march to Delhi, which has been organised in collaboration with over 200 farmers’ outfits. Hundreds of farmers from different locations marched to Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan on Thursday, 29 November. On Friday, 30 November, the farmers will walk from Ramlila Maidan to the Parliament Street to demand a Joint Session of Parliament to discuss the agrarian crisis.

Data from the   submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission of India (ECI) further substantiates this assumption. BJP was the beneficiary of 95 percent of the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. The electoral bonds scheme was notified in January 2018. March 2018 was the   when these bonds were available for purchase from four different branches of SBI (Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai & New Delhi).  using the Right to Information (RTI) revealed that a total of 520 electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were purchased in March 2018. Hence in the year 2017-18, these were the only bonds that were purchased. Most bonds (in terms of number) were purchased in Kolkata where 212 bonds were purchased. In terms of value, most bonds (worth Rs 122 crore) were purchased in Mumbai. As per the   submitted by the BJP to the ECI, the party received Rs 210 crore worth contribution in the form of electoral bonds.  This is a whopping 95 percent of all the electoral bonds purchased in 2017-18. Since the design of the scheme does not allow for the disclosure of names of the contributors, it is impossible to find out who contributed these Rs 210 crore to the BJP. Out of the total voluntary contribution of Rs 989.7 crore received by the BJP in 2017-18, more than 21 percent or Rs 210 crore is through electoral bonds. Even in terms of the total income of the BJP in 2017-18, more than 20 percent is through electoral bonds. 45 percent of BJP’s income in 2016-17 was from unknown sources as per  . This would further increase in 2017-18 because of the anonymous nature of electoral bonds. None of the national or state parties that have   their annual audit report for 2017-18 have declared any income from electoral bonds. It also has to be noted that the Congress and NCP are the only two national parties that are yet to submit their annual audit report for 2017-18. It is possible that the rest of Rs 12 crore worth electoral bonds have gone to either the Congress or NCP or other state parties. It is also possible that a large part of these electoral bonds may not have gone to any party since   using RTI also revealed that bonds worth Rs 11 crore were not encashed by July 2018.  purchased in all the cycles till October 2018 clearly indicates that there is no demand for bonds of lower denomination. In terms of value, bonds of Rs 1 crore denomination accounted for Rs 782 crore or 89.6 percent followed by bonds of Rs 10 lakh denomination that accounted for Rs 89.6 crore or 10.3 percent. Together, they have accounted for close to 99.9 percent of total value of bonds purchased till date. Even in terms of the number of bonds purchased, 1678 out of the 1795 or 93.5 percent electoral bonds purchased till date are in the denomination of Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Though there is no concrete information on the type of purchasers since SBI has refused to share such information, it is highly likely that the Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore denomination are purchased by corporates than individuals.

Sidhu, however, dismissed the reports and said that he does not know who is Gopal Chawla. “There were probably 10,000 pictures taken of and with me (in Pakistan), I don't know who Gopal Chawla is,” Sidhu told news agency ANI after returning to India. The controversy comes months after Sidhu was criticised for embracing Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa while the Punjab minister was attending the swearing-in ceremony of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Chawla, who heads the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, is a prominent pro-Khalistan voice. Earlier this month, he had provoked anger in India after he allegedly stopped Indian officials from visiting a gurudwara in Lahore to meet Sikh pilgrims from India. Chawla was a vocal propagator of ' ' that calls for the “liberation of Punjab.” Speaking to  , Security Analyst Praveen Swami said, “Chawla’s name had cropped up during the investigation of the grenade attack on the Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar, but there is no hard evidence against him.” Chawla is vocal about his pro-Khalistani stand on social media, and in a Facebook video, he can be heard saying, “Bharat is not Bharat, it has become Hindustan, which is why we need Khalistan.” He goes to praise Pakistan and raise anti-India slogans. Defending himself, Chawla told  Chawla also added that he clicked pictures with almost everybody present at the event.

Singh said that Sidhu did not get back to him on the matter. Earlier in August 2018, when the Punjab Minister hugged Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa, on the sidelines of Pakistani PM Imran Khan’s swearing in, it created a furore, and the Punjab CM criticised Sidhu. The Punjab CM stated, that at a time when the Pakistan Army was killing Indian soldiers, Sidhu’s hug was uncalled for. Sidhu who left the BJP due to his strained ties with the Badal family has been far more aggressive on Sukhbir Singh Badal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD, an ally of the BJP) and his brother-in-law Bikramjit Singh Majithia, a former Minister in the erstwhile SAD government. Sidhu sought the arrest of Majithia for his alleged links with drug peddlers (the Punjab minister stated that a special task force report set up by the Congress government had sufficient evidence, which pointed to Majithia’s involvement in drug peddling). The Punjab CM, who in his previous tenure went hammer and tongs against the Badals, has been less combative, with many, including his own party men, alleging that he has a tacit understanding with the Badals. Even when the Ranjit Singh Commission report (set up by Captain Amarinder Singh to investigate the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib in 2015, as well as the death of two peaceful protesters who died as a result of police firing) was tabled in the Punjab assembly, Sidhu took a far stronger line against the Badals, arguing that the report stated that the former CM Parkash Singh Badal had issued firing orders. Captain Amarinder is being hailed for his decision to decline the Pakistani invitation for attending the foundation stone ceremony of the Kartarpur Sahib. Captain Singh has cited terrorism emanating from Pakistan, as well as the role of the Pakistani Army in the same as the reason for his decision. Elahi’s family is known for his proximity to the Pakistan Army as well as the ISI. Captain Singh visited Pakistan in 2005 and held the all Punjab games in December 2004. Significantly, during the 1980’s, the Elahi’s had links with a number of Khalistani activists and some analysts had criticised Captain Singh for going overboard in his outreach to Pakistani Punjab inspite of the above factors. Captain Amarinder Singh during his Pakistan visits has also cultivated strong personal friendships with individuals known to have close links with the Pakistani ‘Deep State’. The reasons for Captain Amarinder Singh’s decision to decline the Pakistani invitation thus are not driven solely by any principles or conviction. While Captain Singh’s decision and aggressive statements do no harm to burnish his nationalist credentials and his tough stance when it comes to national security, it is a bit naive to overlook other factors for Singh’s latest moves. One important factor could be that Navjot Singh Sidhu has stolen the limelight in the context of the Kartarpur issue.     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

After lying unclaimed for centuries, they were colonized by the British for over 150 years and briefly by the Japanese during World War II. They are intricately linked with the forests they live in and have limited, or in some cases, no contact at all with the outside world. Most of them live as hunter-gatherers and prefer to remain in seclusion. Between 2013 and 2016, I faced many challenges living here, as administrator of the islands. Having toured the islands extensively, and interacted with all shades of opinion, I came to the conclusion that there are 4 centres of gravity in these islands viz strategic security; the settlers and their development aspirations; the indigenous tribes and their right to live in the manner they wish to in the protected space reserved for them; and of course, the pristine environment. These 4 centres of gravity have to live in harmony, and not at the expense of each other. This articulation became necessary ad helpful to place the narrative in a balanced perspective. There are strong views on both ends of the spectrum: one view is that we should leave the tribals alone, backed by strong evidence that any contact with modernisation has been deterimental to the primitive tribes. At the other end of the spectrum, there is an equally strong view to mainstream the tribals – why deny them the fruits of modernisation, they ask. We were surprised: the Jarawas wanted selective interaction. There are over 400 Jarawas living in the Jarawa tribal reserve, measuring 1000 sq kms, in south and middle Andaman Islands. The tribe was once feared for their hostility, but over the years have become less so. The Andaman Trunk Road, a national highway that cuts through the tribal reserve , has given rise to allegations of ‘tribal tourism’ by many NGOs who even went to the extent of calling for a tourism boycott of the islands. This accusation was not entirely true, though there have been sporadic cases, including unlawful acts committed by the settlers who live in the vicinity of the reserved areas. As per a Supreme Court directive, an alternate sea route has also become functional. Violations of the primitive tribe regulations ANPATR-1956 are viewed very seriously, though convictions in the courts have been tardy. In our endeavour to interact with them, seven-eight hotspots were designated for interactions to take place. Women would get their children on designated days, and a bilingual script based on their own ‘Ongan’ language was taught. A very rudimentary barter system was also initiated to preserve their dignity. To our surprise, the women requested for clothes; basic clothing was provided, which the women wore only when crossing the road. We also set up an “Andaman Nicobar Tribal Research Institute – ANTRI” in 2014, where research and study programmes provide valuable data for creating informed policies. In fact, some of the Nicobar elders were very enthused, as they believed that their heritage, culture, customs, language and traditions needed to be preserved for future generations. Untill 1993, the administration tried to befriend the Sentinelese, but their efforts were in vain. With effect from 1993, the approved policy was changed to “hands off” to respect the will of the Sentinelese. This meant that we could undertake periodical helicopter reconnaissances, and also circumnavigation by sea. A number of poachers were apprehended near the island, vindicating our change of policy. While a case of murder may have been registered against unknown people, the law will be difficult to apply against people who do not understand it, live in a different world, and who only acted to defend themselves against illegal intrusion. A similar dilemma occurred with respect to the Jarawas. Once a report came in that Jarawa men had killed a 5-month-old-child whom they suspected of being born of illicit relations between a settler and a Jarawa woman. While the settler was arrested, we did not have clarity with reference to the Jarawa, who were actually very open about it. Such cases have to be dealt with very sensitively, keeping in view the fact that the isolated tribes do not understand the law and live by their own customs. As per available information, the government has removed ‘Restricted Area Permit’ from 29 islands upto 2022, including islands which  are inhabited by PVTGs, 3 islands in South Andaman and 9 islands in Nicobar district. This has caused dismay and alarm amongst many who are concerned about the well being of the tribals. It obviously appears to be with an aim to mainstream the tribals, as also to boost tourism, albeit, without due diligence about the effects and in contravention of ANPATR-1956. It cannot be anyone’s case that Nicobar islands must remain restricted forever. But opening it should be a gradual process and with the consent of the tribal council. In fact in my tenure, we had started this dialogue with the tribal captains and there was a mixed response. It would be wise to move forward slowly and with sensitivity. Such decisions cannot be based on a notion to turn these islands into another Phuket or Macao. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

This is a curious call to action because, hopefully, the BJP and RSS know that no law can bypass the Constitution or judicial challenges in courts. And this law in particular – assuming the ruling party will have it passed in both houses of the Parliament – will most certainly be challenged in the Supreme Court. Unless the government seeks to build religious centres for all communities –which, given the political and ideological proclivities of the ruling dispensation, is unimaginable – the law to not only acquire the disputed land for a temple, but also to build it, would run into the headwinds of the constitutional guarantee of  . Gandhi and Sardar Patel supported the reconstruction of the Somnath temple, but not by the government and not by using state funds, despite the fact that the Somnath temple was not disputed in the way the Ram temple is. Secularism of the Indian state approximates more to proximity to all religions, rather than equal distance from all. The state is involved with a number of existing religious practices and institutions, but to pass a law that not only favours the faith of one community over another, but also legitimises retrospectively the assault committed on the faith of a minority community by the destruction of the Babri Masjid, would be to go too far beyond any possible definition of a secular state. We have been here before. The last time the government sought to acquire the land to settle the dispute between territories through the Acquisition of Central Area of Ayodhya Act, 1993, it took the matter (itself) to the Supreme Court in a reference, and declared before it, that it was committed “to the construction of a Ram temple and a mosque”, without specifying exact locations. The matter, at the heart of it, is a land dispute – a fact that is easy to forget in the political and ideological heat that surrounds it. (It is pertinent to remember that what was destroyed on 6 December 1992 was not only the Babri Masjid, but also the Ram Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi, whose existence is historically parallel to the Babri Mosque.) In  , the Supreme Court struck down the aforementioned 1993 Act saying that it was unconstitutional, as it overrode the property rights of the Muslim litigants, acquired according to the latter’s pleadings, through the simple fact that the Babri Masjid had stood on the disputed land at least since the 16th century. In addition, the government would also have to demonstrate that any such acquisition is in public interest – not an easy task, given that acquiring the land to build a Ram temple would favour one religion over another. If the government were to pass another such Act (this time with no proposal to build a mosque, presumably) it will also have to contend with the Places of Worship Act (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which bars the conversion of any place of worship, including of course a mosque, as it existed on independence – a fairly fundamental safeguard for a secular state. Until that date, around when Muslims were forcibly stopped from using the mosque, Babri Masjid was a place of worship for the latter, barring the Ram Chabutra, which of course was a Hindu place of worship. It  also easy to forget that there is a criminal case winding its way through the judicial system given that it has been progressing at a pace that would put glaciers to shame. A law of the nature demanded by senior RSS leaders would only further abuse that the trust, and provide state approval and sanction to the demolition. If it comes into force, then the Supreme Court will have to answer if a criminal act can create property and other rights. Given the context, and our institutional and constitutional structure, it is baffling that the RSS is pushing the government to come up with a law to bypass the judiciary. The worst they can do is to keep mounting all kinds of pressure on the judiciary – including, for instance, the sort of vitriolic and personalised attack that Indresh Kumar launched on ‘2-3’ judges in a speech that he delivered on 27 November – and hope that the courts will buckle under pressure. But they cannot stop the law they are demanding from being brought to the courts, and challenged. Further delay means that the issue will remain emotive and eminently exploitable for elections to come but if the RSS’s real intent is to see a Ram temple built on the disputed land, a law passed by the government cannot help them bypass the judiciary. The only way to bypass the judiciary at first pass is to build the temple illegally, and the only way to bypass it altogether, is to change the Constitution to suit their end goal.

I donated it to those families of the farmers that committed suicide. While that went on for a number of years, I realised that the number of people I was benefitting was very small in proportion to the amount of distress there was. So I felt like, why not start a political movement! Something on a larger scale. Now, with the help of the district administration in UP, we identified such farmers and started crowd-funding in those areas. We worked with around 4,300 farmers across districts like Allahabad, Balrampur, Bijnor, Lakhimpur-Khiri. We were very particular about keeping the rate of recidivism low. It should not be like that a person takes the money, reduces or eliminates his debt, and goes on to spend it on his daughter’s marriage and gets back into debt again. This movement gave me a sense that we could see things to their logical conclusion. But again, this scale was very small. I realised that to effect a social transformation, we need to change things at the policy level because that’s the only way things are going to be systemically solved. That’s when I started working on this book. This book has taken me to 11 states, 60 districts to talk about things like water, labour, textile, energy access, agricultural marketing etc.” “You always find a very urban bias towards the fact that the farmer loan waivers have been given. If you look at total farm loan waivers in the country versus industry subsidies, the total farm loan waivers today are exactly 3.6% of the industry subsidies. When we are talking about people who are 70% of the total population, just 3.6%! So exactly which sops are we talking about? The conversation on agriculture these days is almost as if we are doing the farmers a favour, which is completely the other way round. A farmer doing a hectare of paddy or wheat farming earns about Rs 2,500-2,800 per month from that. An agricultural labourer earns about 5000 rupees a month. So a farmer is doing worse than the labour working on his field. How can it be sustainable? No wonder 30 million people in the last five years have left agriculture. 50 million people before that in the last ten years. That’s a lot of people. If it continues down this road, our food security will be threatened. My point is not simply about agriculture. My study is an academic critique of how the village as an economic unit can be viable a 100 years from now. Because if the village doesn’t remain viable then frankly India as a country is going to collapse. The cities cannot bear the burden of internal migration. We need to look at non-farm income, we need to look at textile, handicrafts. India has over 300 handicraft clusters. Why are we not ramping those up? In India one sustainable job in steel costs 24 lakh rupees; 24 jobs are created in textile for 1 lakh rupees. As a country, which one should we be looking at? We have an army of unemployed people, what are we doing?” “When Bombay Presidency was created, the British focused on irrigation in the southern Bombay Presidency, which is the present day Gujarat, and in western Maharashtra of today. But they did very little in what is now Vidarbha because it was largely seen as jungle. Now look at the consequence of something as basic as irrigation. The farmers of Vidarbha have 4% irrigation and they have been reduced to total pauperisation and this region sees the largest rate of farmer suicides in the country. The problems are there but the solutions are not terribly difficult.” “It’s not about the government only. It’s also about the channels in the middle. There is a historical study done in 1972 in then Calcutta, which said that just 2% of the end-user price of an orange reached the farmer because the marketing channels had consumed the majority of the value. Just look at our APMCs, the mandis. Unpaved roads, open spaces. Even today there are no storage facilities, there is no cover. A lot of stuff gets rotten. When you go there it’s almost like a mafia is running it. The farmers are at their mercy. The farmer goes there from his village 7-8 km away in a tractor trolley. Sometimes he stays there for 3-4 days awaiting good price. And then in desperation he sells at whatever price. Even if we do nothing else and just fix the mandis in our country that itself will alleviate and mitigate a lot of farmer distress. “These are very good solutions. Communication and information revolution will help the farmer. The point is, however, how many farmers have the smartphone? Even if they have smartphones they have cheap ones that don’t have enough battery power to run them. The electricity situation is not the best so their phones are not charged half the time. One of the projects that I undertook in Banda was with a group that was doing a lot of great work with information disseminated from Mandya in Karnataka via the mobile. Initially we took 4 villages in Banda and we started sharing this with them and we found that they were resistant. They said, “ ” But when I visited again after three months they were literally looking at their phones for one hour a day to educate themselves. Digital solutions will certainly work but please remember that in India we have gone from medievalism to post-modernism in a record period of time. So, we are living in, simultaneously, two different time zones.” “When talking about dairy, my mother takes the animal rights approach and I see it from purely economic perspective. Now a person engaged in dairy farming will eventually take the animal to the slaughterhouse after its milch phase is over because they can’t afford to keep them. What we need to look at is different systems to keep those creatures relevant for the farmer. In India, we have a desperate need for energy. When LPG cylinders—which are made from crude oil—spike in price they become unaffordable for the last man in society. So, if we can look at gobar gas plants many of our issues are solved. A bovine creature gives about 30-40 kgs of gobar everyday. If we can build localised gobar gas plants in every village and connect them to every house we’d have increased electricity, the tyranny of distance would be less and it would be cheaper. And those animals would always be relevant and therefore lead the life of some dignity.” (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

These were the words of the   when he promised to personally lead the global body towards greater gender equality. As the world observes the start of ‘16 Days of Activism’ against gender-based violence (from 26 November 2018), an independent United Nations system-wide survey on sexual harassment is taking place around all UN country offices. It is the first of its kind, and it demonstrates the UN’s resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe and inclusive workplace for all personnel across its offices. The UN initiative is in lock-step with the theme for this year’s ‘16 Days of Activism’ – ‘Orange the World; Hear Me Too’. The aim is to raise awareness about violence against women and its impact on a woman’s physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being. The #MeToo movement heralded the coming out of women across various professions and work forces, against their (primarily) male perpetrators, breaking a decades-old silence that they were previously compelled to live with. Statistics indicate that more than one in three women across the world have experienced physical or sexual violence, usually perpetrated by an intimate partner. In a   by Edison Research and Marketplace on sexual harassment, 27 percent of women and 14 percent of men reported that they had been harassed at some time at their workplace. Despite the progressive policy commitments and institutional frameworks on gender equality and women empowerment, implementation remains slow and inconsistent. While the   campaign has gained high momentum since its launch in September 2014, a lot still needs to be done to bring men on board in addressing sexual harassment towards women in public and private spaces. Such campaigns have brought considerable gains towards raising consciousness and self-assurance for women. Increasingly, they are speaking out against the indignities of work-related sexual advances and intimidation. This is the cost that countries are paying when women and girls are denied the chance to live to their full social and economic potential. Consider the aspect of employment: according to a World Bank   released this year, countries are losing USD 160 trillion in wealth because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men. This amounts to an average of USD 23,620 for each person. In India, reports indicate that every 4 in 10 women have experienced some form of domestic violence. In a country where physical and psychological abuse is all pervasive and rampant, the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 has done little to alleviate gender-based discrimination and violence. The Act requires an employer to set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at each office that has more than 10 employees of any gender. However, a   done some years back found that 7 in 10 working women did not report workplace harassment, demonstrating a disturbing lack of confidence in the system. By one  , gender inequality may have reduced India’s economic growth by almost 4 percent annually over the past 10 years. . It is estimated that 27 percent of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. It is said that the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25 percent increase in wages. In addition, ensuring that all girls get at least secondary education in India, would reduce child marriages by more than half. All these demonstrate the cyclical benefits, from one generation to the next, of education as an intervention strategy. However, while evidence abounds that parity with women is the best driving force for economic growth, wealth creation and poverty eradication, women’s rights are being “reduced, restricted and reversed”, according to UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres. There cannot be any illusions about the enormity of the task ahead. Misogyny is a deep-rooted expression of male entitlement that often excuses sexual harassment and violence, even at times by the survivors themselves. Women shouldn't have to feel 'grateful' for opportunities, says the UN DSG Amina Mohammed in a  . So true. Ultimately, countries need to begin breaking structural barriers, not just with gender equality as a lofty ideal but as a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. ’s (What does the first-time woman voter want?

This came a day after Chandramukhi’s mother, Anitha Muvvala, represented by lawyer Vasudha Nagraj, filed a habeas corpus writ petition in the Hyderabad High Court. Admitting the petition, the court had asked the Jubilee Hills police to produce Chandramukhi before them by 10:15 am on Thursday. Chandramukhi had reportedly been missing since 8:25 am on Tuesday, 27 November; based on the missing person's complaint, an FIR has been filed. The police said that they are reviewing CCTV footage.

Speaking to TNM, Anitha confirmed that Chandramukhi had been found and was doing okay. She is expected to be produced at the court at 10 am. \"She has come back. She was abducted by someone and intimidated severely, she's dazed and disoriented. She'll share what happened to her before the court,\" Vasudha Nagaraj, her lawyer, told TNM. “She was noticed missing since 8:25 am and the door of her house is locked from the outside,” the Banjara Hills SHO said. Chandramukhi, a well-known face in Hyderabad’s trans community, is contesting from the Goshamahal constituency in Hyderabad on a Bahujan Left Front (BLF) ticket. She will be taking on bigwigs such as the BJP’s Raja Singh and the Congress’ Mukesh Goud.

Hluna told the news agency that he didn’t think that Modi, Shah and the party’s other central leaders had made enough of an effort for the pre-election campaign in Mizoram, as they had only sent one lawmaker and not visited any constituency themselves. He further said that since Hindi or English isn’t the first language of the Mizo people, the party’s central leadership did not have that much effect on them. Another point he brought up, was the lack of funds and lack of power that the state party was being given by its central leadership. “They should give us more money so that we can run things on our own. But there is no money, we are very poor. If there is a lot of money, we can do well,” he told  .

He had supported the idea of joint polls before suddenly declaring early polls in Telangana and, as recently as August 2018, KCR had sent out indications that he is even open to a possible post-poll tie up with the BJP. But there seems to be a twist in that “friendly” tale with the BJP, and in the last three days, the Telangana campaign has been dominated by an acerbic  , in an exchange of statements and allegations. Hitting back at Modi, KCR, speaking at a rally in Mahbubnagar, alleged that the prime minister was “spreading lies for votes” and even referred to him as a “foolish” prime minister. He further stated that he was “not scared” of the prime minister like his political rivals. Firstly, KCR’s principal rival in the state is the Congress party and hence it is necessary for him to have a cordial equation with the BJP. Further, Telangana as a newly-formed state is heavily dependent on the Centre and hence, he needs a good equation with the prime minister. This population is not just centred around Hyderabad city where it even has a majority in some assembly seats, but is spread across the state and can be decisive in districts like Nizamabad or even KCR’s bastion Mahbubnagar. KCR and the TRS seem to have a friendly equation with the most powerful voice of the Muslims in the state, the All India Majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi, but there is no open alliance with the MIM and there are fears that Muslim voters may alienate the TRS as it is being seen as close to the BJP. There are also serious doubts over KCR’s gamble of calling for an early election. Ground reports indicate that the Congress has regrouped itself, and the alliance it has formed with the Telugu Desam Party, Left and the Telanagana Jana Samithi has formidable arithmetic on the ground. The combined vote share of the allies was nearly 40 percent in 2014 when the TRS managed to win just over half the seats with 34 percent vote share. The political dynamics seem to lend weight to the Congress’s allegation that the rivalry between KCR and the prime minister is ostensible. However, the fact that the TRS has an alliance with the MIM, which is formidable in Hyderabad, is a headache for the Congress. TRS leaders also point out that the TDP had an open alliance with the BJP before shifting sides, and hence, the Congress’s grand alliance (Maha Kootami as it is called in Telugu) is an alliance of opportunity and not one of values. But, in all this, what’s there for the BJP? Firstly, the Bharatiya Janata Party clearly hopes for a Congress defeat in Telangana. As a party, its stakes are minimal in the assembly polls, and hence, its ideal result would be a TRS win. However, in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP desperately needs allies in the south of India, and TRS is a potential candidate. But BJP leaders insist that they want to create an independent identity in the state and the prime minister targeting KCR is a message, that the party cannot be taken lightly by regional players. Finally, the nature of the attacks the two leaders made against each other was fierce and personal, and the language suggests that it needs to be taken seriously. But then, real life politics is stranger than fiction, and the sharper an exchange, the stronger the perception of being rivals!         (What does the first-time woman voter want?

That is why I closed that door. Those who want to speak ill of me, they can. But I am convinced that whatever I did was correct,” he said. He was addressing students of the ITM University.

Sajjad Lone has the numbers, obviously Delhi will push for him,” the governor told  . Malik has reinforced his allegations against Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) chief Omar Abdullah for not showing seriousness in forming the government. “If PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti and NC leader Omar Abdullah were serious about forming a government (by joining hands) in Jammu and Kashmir, they should have rung me up, or sent me a letter” Governor Malik said. The governor said that he took the decision of dissolving the assembly without seeking any advice or direction or holding any discussion with Delhi. He clarified that as per the state Constitution, he did not have to take permission from the president or Parliament. \"I returned at 4 PM from Delhi and I got a briefing from intelligence officials about the situation.

However, minutes after the tweet, Abdullah tweeted congratulating the governor for “not looking to Delhi and for not taking their instructions.” Contrary to Malik’s move of dissolving the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah said the governor should have given the parties wanting to form the government a chance, instead of dissolving the Assembly. “He (Malik) has to defend himself in front of the government in Delhi, and you know what the government is all about. The Assembly should have seen who has the majority. It cannot be decided in the Raj Bhawan. Why didn’t they dissolve the Assembly earlier?” Abdullah told  .

For a western mind hooked on the idea that all parts of the planet including the remote polar regions can be penetrated and conquered easily, the idea seemed preposterous – almost archaic – that a handful of men could kill an individual with just a bow and arrow. But here’s what the headlines are not telling you. This incident is in fact symptomatic of some of the broader changes being initiated on the island to overthrow a decades old ‘hands off’ policy, and open up the chain of islands like a box of chocolates for real estate and tourism sharks to bite into. Earlier, permission had to be taken for tourists to travel to these areas, most of which were off-limit in the past. And there are other plans afoot, courtesy a special committee appointed to review the current laws related to India’s coastline, that will introduce a slew of policy measures endangering not just the tribal islanders, but also stress the fragile ecology here. First, it’s important to understand why the islands are so special and why the Indian government followed a policy of protectionism in the past. Just 37 of the group of 572 islands, are permanently inhabited, by a mix of indigenous tribes and Indians (the latter were brought here as prisoners of the British, after the First War of Independence in 1857). The Nicobar Islands are home to two 'Mongloid' tribes – the Shompen and Nicobarese. The 'Negrito' tribes are believed to have arrived in the islands from Africa up to 60,000 years ago. All are nomadic hunter-gatherers, hunting wild pig and monitor lizard, and catching fish with bows and arrows. They also collect honey, roots and berries from the forest. Some of the Nicobarese people do some form of cultivation, and are also involved in what are considered ‘mainstream’ jobs. Each of these tribal groups have faced an onslaught from outsiders;  Great Andamanese for instance today number just 43. The tribe that has suffered most from contact with outsiders: 99 percent have been wiped out since the British first colonized the islands, the Onges number just 100 – their forest home has been plundered over the years by poachers and loggers. Then there is the Sentinelese, the ones that Chau sought to ‘befriend’ – their population estimated at 50-100. They are the most isolated of all the tribes – they have no peaceful contact with outsiders, and it is said – they fire warning arrows at those who approach. The islands also boast of a rich biodiversity. Of the 9,000 species recorded here, over a 1,000 are endemic, which means they are found just here and NOWHERE else in the world. A great example is the majestic Narcondam hornbill found on the island by the same name, the Andaman Day Gecko and the Andaman woodpecker. The islands themselves are considered a global biodiversity hotspot but threats are always looming large from ill-planned developers and commercial interests. Now take a look at the plans in store that will most certainly flatten out biodiversity as well as endanger the tribal groups here. The Draft Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2018 was introduced based on recommendations from the ‘Shailesh Nayak Committee’ report. This new draft permits the opening up of ecologically important inter-tidal zones, to destructive and polluting activities. A conglomerate of scientists and lawyers working on coastal issues wrote to the Environment Minister Dr Harshvardhan in October, red flagging some of the decisions being taken, along with sending a detailed critique to the policy makers. Sweeping changes have been made in the earlier law referred to as the Island Coastal Zone Regulation of 2011, that now allows developers of shopping and housing complexes, hotels and entertainment complexes to walk in, thus diluting safeguards in place before. These are broad and open-ended phrases that are open to interpretation, thus opening the floodgates for the entry of many detrimental activities as ‘permissible’ ones. Another concern that has been red flagged by biologists is the arbitrary classification of ecologically sensitive areas. “Eco-tourism” activities have been allowed in the ecologically sensitive areas of what is referred to as ‘ICRZ I-A’- these include areas such as coral reefs, mangroves and sand dunes, which are not only ecologically sensitive, but are also critical for the survival of the islands as they buffer the islands against socio-ecological pressures and disasters. Many ecosystems such as rocky beaches, areas with high biodiversity, fish breeding and spawning areas etc. have been left out of this notification even though they are crucial for the islands. The Andaman and Nicobar and the Lakshadweep have unique geological history, and their coasts are influenced by a combination of tectonic, oceanic, atmospheric and ecological processes. Not only are they different from the coast of the mainland, they are also particularly fragile and vulnerable to climate change. The draft ICRZ notification 2018 does not take into account these particularities of the island ecosystem. Even habitats frequented by the critically endangered species like the sea cow or the Dugong has not been spared. Inter-tidal areas are also important feeding sites for dugongs, as they may contain sea grass species that are preferred. Dugongs are highly endangered species, with less than 50 individuals left in the Indian Ocean, and facing a rapid decline of population, and their conservation must be a priority. Disturbance of such areas through activities permitted above or accidents such as oil spills may be the death knell for these animals and may lead to local extinction. Biologists working on the islands have urged that the protective safeguards in the 2011 Notification should be retained. With these sweeping changes being introduced in government policy, the ethereal beauty and uniqueness of the Andaman and Nicobar islands could be lost forever. It is but sad that the Sentinelese had to take it upon them to protect their island. In this day when social media is the beast, this ‘primitive’ tribal group has managed, with just a bow and arrow, to send a message to the entire world – leave our land and forest alone.

The torpedoing of Manafort's plea deal, disclosed in  on Monday, 26 November, also results in special counsel Robert Mueller's team losing a cooperating witness from the top of Donald Trump's presidential campaign who was present for several key episodes under investigation. That includes a Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer he was told had derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton. The move signals a return to the acrimonious relationship Manafort has had with the special counsel's office since his indictment last year. Before his plea agreement, Manafort aggressively challenged the special counsel's legitimacy in court, went through a bitter trial and landed himself in jail after prosecutors discovered he had attempted to tamper with witnesses in his case. Prosecutors said they will detail the \"nature of the defendant's crimes and lies\" in writing at a later date to the judge. Through his attorneys, Manafort denied lying, saying he \"believes he provided truthful information\" during a series of sessions with Mueller's investigators. He also disagreed that he breached his plea agreement. Still, both sides now agree they can't resolve the conflict, and US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson should set a date to sentence him. Manafort, who remains jailed, had been meeting with the special counsel's office since he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He cut that deal to head off a second trial after being convicted last summer of eight felony counts related to millions of dollars he hid from the IRS in offshore accounts. Both cases stemmed from his Ukrainian political work and undisclosed lobbying work he admitted to carrying out in the US in violation of federal law. As part of his plea agreement, Manafort pledged to “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly” with the government “in any and all matters” prosecutors deemed necessary. That included his work on the Trump campaign as well as his Ukrainian political work, which remains under investigation by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors there are   the conduct of longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and former Republican congressman and lobbyist Vin Weber to determine whether they violated federal law by failing to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. None of the men has been charged with any crimes. But with prosecutors saying he breached the agreement, Manafort now faces serious repercussions such as the possibility of prosecution on additional charges including the 10 felony counts prosecutors dropped when he made the deal. Manafort already faces up to five years in prison on the two charges in his plea agreement. In his separate Virginia case, Manafort's potential sentencing under federal guidelines has not yet been calculated, but prosecutors have previously said he could face as much as 10 years in prison on those charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in that case in February. His co-defendant Rick Gates, who spent a longer time on the campaign and worked on the Trump inaugural committee, has not had a sentencing date set yet. He continues to cooperate with Mueller.

She would tell you, in these hundred years, what has altered most significantly is this: When she was a child, if you grew food, it was an absolute guarantee you would not starve. Now, in 2018, if you are a farmer, it is almost certain you will. And so, it is that at the age of one hundred that she walked from her village Baradi in Nandurbar district for ten kilometres to get to the nearest town from where she got into a shared taxi. From there to the train in the next town, and then another train, and after nearly twenty hours of continuous and taxing travel, she arrived in Mumbai, to join thousands of protesting farmers demanding many things, but essentially one thing — the right to live.

This year has been a particularly bad crop in her district. The yield was half what it was from last year. Her children and grand-children all work as daily wagers on other farms and on road and building projects and still it’s hard to find enough to eat. Things are in fact so impossible that Jijabai decided to put herself and her tired body though this agonizing journey to make her voice count. Even though she was just a speck – one of the thousands of people to have arrived at Mumbai’s Azan Maidan on 21 November, ahead of the long march to Delhi – she considered it vital enough for her to be there. On that day, Sachinbhai — a leader from the Lok Sangharsh Morcha in Maharasthra said Jijabai woke up at 4 am with the others. And since the participation was entirely voluntary, most people, including Jijabai didn’t have anything to eat all day. She had her first cup of chai after noon. But there was fire in her belly. With the system weighed so heavily against them, farmers across the country are preparing to be in Delhi’s Ramlila maidan on 29 and 30 November, demanding that a special session of parliament be convened to raise crucial survival issues. Her voice was barely audible after a day at the rally. “Sorry, I’ve lost my voice,” she said, apologetic, but happy to see the issue get some traction. At the other end of the country, K Balakrishnan from the ‘Jai Kisan Andolan’ and Convener of the Tamil Nadu farmers’ agitation, said even rich farmers are in distress with cyclone Gaja having destroyed their crop. This is why crop insurance, the guarantee of a minimum support price from the state, and the allotment of land promised to tribals is crucial, he explained. And in the case of farmers reeling from the effects of the cyclone, compensation that hasn’t still been given. Ramesh Chander from Jind in Haryana, echoes these sentiments. He also added that this government has been particularly harsh on farmers. Until 2014, there was at least a minimum guarantee of 50-55 days of daily wages under the MNREGA scheme. Now, in the non-agricultural season, there is no guarantee of getting daily wage work. And the supplementary income from the sale of cattle once it’s past its prime has stopped, thanks to the cow vigilante groups, he added. “The rate of purchase of milk has dropped and I can’t sell my buffalo either,” Chander lamented. Adding that farmers groups – 200 of them were also being strategic in the timing of their agitation. “Yeh election ka saal hai, this is an election season.” He’s lost 30,000 rupees this agricultural season, and if he doesn’t join the tidal wave of voices now, it will be a big opportunity lost. His survival could be at stake. Avik Saha, Organising Secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination group or the AIKSCC summed it up in a catch-phrase he has coined for the march – “Modi Ko Harao, Rahul Ko Darao” (Remove Modi, Scare Rahul). “Our job,” he clarified, “is to make it impossible to ignore farmers.” The politics of the movement is absolutely transparent. They would like to build pressure on the Modi government at a time when they are aware it is facing the heat on every front. And they would like to extract these basic promises ahead of the 2019 elections. The long-term goal is to build the 200 farmers groups that have signed on into a collective block. Lingraj, a farmers’ activist from Odisha, said his organisation doesn’t have money. So about a thousand farmers from that state will travel by train, unreserved. “You can classify the farmers by the routes they take from different parts of the country,” Avik Saha remarked. Farmers from Bihar and Odisha can only travel unreserved, but in Karnataka, there are some who will be flying in. For now, they have nothing to hold onto but their dissent. Farming is all that Jijabai knows. At a hundred plus years, she would like to be able to hold on to that one basic thing – the right to grow food and for it to be sustainable.  ‘     (What does the first-time woman voter want?

This belief was reinforced in March 2015 when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formed a coalition government with the People's Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir. In those months – despite odd attacks on churches, provocative statements of his party and ministerial colleagues, and a  affiliate's controversial Ghar Wapasi campaign – it appeared that Modi was willing to put the divisive past behind him. Forget Indians who had not voted for Modi; since August 2017, as dissatisfaction triggered by the slapdash roll-out of GST grew, it became evident – borne out repeatedly by election verdicts since the Gujarat result – that even large sections of those who   for him were no longer backing him. This sense deepened in June after Mehbooba Mufti resigned, following which BJP pulled out of the coalition and withdrew support to the PDP. The dissolution of the State Assembly last week has further pushed BJP to its core agenda. To understand, there is need to analyse what Modi jettisoned in March 2015 when he and BJP president Amit Shah were in attendance, when Mufti Mohammed Sayeed took oath as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir along with BJP's Nirmal Singh as Deputy Chief Minister, besides other 23 other ministers from the two parties. It was a courageous decision to align with the PDP. To do so, Modi had to silence the slogan which served as his party's clarion call on J&K for 62 years since 1953. The slogan was coined by the party in memory of its iconic founder president, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, after he died in June 1953 in Srinagar jail where he was detained for forcibly entering the state despite orders to the contrary: (The Kashmir where Mookerjee laid down his life, is ours) Neither was the air rent with this emotional slogan to convey sense of satisfaction of being in power in a 'lost' state – albeit in a coalition – nor did any of the party leaders or cadre give voice to what they have grown up with – Mookerjee's slogan, or the rhyme, he shouted along with party activists, including 29-year-old Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in the course of his agitation on Kashmir: (In one country, there cannot be two constitutions, two heads and two flags) Since Mookerjee's death, abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution which grants autonomous status to the state along with a separate Constitution, was one of the three contentious issues that was the BJP's hallmark, contributing to its claim of being a party with a difference. But post 2014, with the BJP having a majority of its own and not being dependent on coalition partners, this response would not have sounded convincing. This was especially true because the BJP did not dilute its posture on the other two disruptive demands: construction of Ram temple and introduction of Uniform Civil Code. The formation of the coalition was not billed as evidence of majoritarian triumph in the only Muslim-majority state, despite this having been the stated objective since the Jana Sangh days. Each of BJP's 25 seats were located in predominantly Hindu-majority seats of the Jammu region. The BJP had mounted an audacious Mission 44+ campaign for the 2014 Assembly polls. Despite this acrimonious campaign, its decision to align with the PDP indicated a visible departure from Mookerjee's and BJP's past visions of the state’s relationship with the rest of India. Modi realised that as the national helmsman, he had to view challenges in the state beyond what the party was accustomed to. In utterances, Modi and colleagues indicated the necessity to leave behind the 3Cs – conflict, contradictions, cynicism. Instead, they had to follow just one mantra: R – reboot or reconciliation. Clearly, the party realised that to resolve conflict, dialogue and joint action were the only ways to reinforce the region's pluralistic heritage and extricate itself from the quagmire it has been trapped in for decades. Yet, Modi squandered the chance of securing the love and affection of the Kashmiris like Vajpayee did. His reiteration of Insaniyat (Humanism), Jamhooriyat (Democracy) and Kashmiriyat (Kashmir's age-old legacy of Hindu-Muslim amity) rang hollow because the Centre faltered on every pledge it made, the worst being the lack of urgency on the flood rehabilitation package. The situation worsened after the generational transition in PDP following Mufti's death. From April 2016, when Mehbooba Mufti became chief minister, the BJP's engagement in J&K was not with an eye on ushering normalcy into the state. There is little doubt that the BJP faces an uphill battle in 2019 and this cannot be won on the basis of this government's performance. To prevent the parliamentary hustings being reduced to a state-wise aggregation of polls, the BJP requires a set of emotive issues. This plank has been under construction for the past several months. The majoritarian platform contain several elements – Ram temple, fresh confrontation in  , renaming of cities and towns, continuing campaigns for cow protection and against Love Jihad, and so on. The BJP's latest tactics on Kashmir and its declaration that the state requires no special treatment coupled with the continuing tough posture on Pakistan completes the bouquet of Hindutva-centric issues with which the BJP will approach the electorate. As far as Kashmir is concerned, there is now little to differentiate between the sentiment of the fringe that supports BJP and the party's mainstream. The BJP's promise of a paradigm shift is now a mirage. In the hope of consolidating Hindus to vote on the basis of their religious identity, he has lost the support of those who considered him a pragmatist and not a committed ideologue. The wheel has come full circle for Modi, and also for J&K. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

The attack carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operatives from Pakistan went on for four days, starting on 26 November, and left over 160 people dead. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was caught alive, and revealed in subsequent investigations how the LeT planned, organised and executed the deadly act. Ten men had arrived from Pakistan via sea, disembarking from Karachi city, and landing on a beach in Mumbai. The Indian authorities hanged Kasab, the lone survivor of the attack in 2012. The Americans also caught another person involved in the attacks, David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-origin American, who confessed that he had done reconnaissance missions in Mumbai prior to the attacks, and had shared this information with those organising the attacks. Headley is currently serving a 35-year sentence in an American prison. On paper, LeT is banned in Pakistan since 2002, but it operates under different names today in the country and continues to find recruits, carry out cross-border terrorism from Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and expand its footprint in Pakistan without much hindrance. Lakhvi is said to be in charge of LeT in Pakistan and is a close associate of Hafiz Saeed, who founded LeT in the late eighties. Hafiz Saeed publicly disassociated himself from LeT and launched Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), which he professes is a charity organisation. However, both local and international authorities believe JuD is a front for LeT. The United States has even offered a $10 million reward for information that can lead to Saeed’s conviction for the Mumbai attacks. Post 26/11, JuD came under international scrutiny too and was designated a global terrorist group by the United Nations. Following this, Pakistan also took some cosmetic measures against it; but the group once again relaunched under a new name called Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation. Even that has been exposed and since then it is suspected to have come up with another new name called Tehreek-e-Azadi Jammu and Kashmir. Many point to its linkages with the Pakistan military. It is suspected that LeT enjoys support from the so-called parallel shadow government, and the real policy makers of the country: the Pakistan Army. Therefore, evidences against the group are rare to come by, and there is very little that the civilian authorities can do, even if they want to take action against the group. In 2015, Tariq Khosa, the former head of Pakistan’s leading civilian law enforcement agency called the Federal Investigation Authority, wrote how there was enough evidence that his organisation had uncovered against the LeT operating from a camp near the city of Karachi. Despite that, no one in Pakistan has been convicted to date in the Mumbai attacks trials, which continue to linger on without any meaningful progress for the last nine years. In an interview this year, when Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif posed a question to the reporter asking why the Mumbai attack trials had not concluded and why militants were being allowed to cross the border and kill people, Pakistani courts initiated a treason case against the former premier and the journalist who published the interview, for defaming national institutions. Observers say it is to serve the strategic foreign policy purposes of the Pakistani military which wants to keep the Kashmir conflict militarised, so that the Armed Forces’ relevance and dominance in Pakistan continues to remain unchallenged – because as long as there is a conflict with the next-door neighbour, the Pakistan army will be able to justify its budgets, its interference in political matters and its human rights abuses in the name of security. Recently, the military has also started using the LeT’s charity wing, JuD, for domestic political purposes. The JuD launched the Milli Muslim League (MML), and its backed candidates contested the recent general elections. While a former military general alluded that the group was introduced to politics to mainstream militants, the real reason many believe they were introduced in Punjab, Pakistan is to dent the vote bank of the last ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz faction (PMLN). The military believes the PMLN is harmful for its interests as it wants to normalise relations with India. But it is not just state support the LeT seems to enjoy in Pakistan. The group also seems to enjoy popularity among the population, partly because it can operate freely in many parts of the country, but mainly because these regions are areas where vulnerable Pakistanis are looking for subsistence, given lack of income, and at times, due to circumstances that have forced them to look for help. Also, the local Pakistani media reports on the movement favourably, projecting it as a welfare organisation. I have followed the group closely during my reporting missions in the country and have seen how they run a strong network of charity organisations. In one such reporting trip to South Punjab, I saw Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, one of the fronts of LeT, helping out the flood-affected by bringing them food and providing them shelter. When I asked one of the organisers about their motive behind the help, the organiser told me it was to find recruits among this population for their movement, adding how many households in such rural populations had large families, with too many children. When I had first learnt of how they were brainwashing youngsters in this manner, I had mentioned it to a serving Pakistani military intelligence official that I knew as a source. But this policy of allowing “external-looking” militancy to continue to exist has come back to haunt the country. In recent times, many former LeT operatives have joined other terrorist organisations like the ISIS, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi etc, and now consider Pakistan a target too and have carried out terror attacks on Pakistani soil. Pakistan’s policy makers must realise that by allowing such groups to continue operating in the country and thinking the country will remain safe from them is not the way forward. The Pakistani military repeatedly says it is committed to fighting terrorism and bringing peace. But if that is true, one of the right steps in that direction should include an actual crackdown against groups like the LeT. To start with, Pakistan should punish those involved in the Mumbai attacks and then also dismantle its infrastructure in the country. Otherwise, its commitment to peace in the South Asian region looks doubtful. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

He said Maldives considered India such an \"important partner\" that new Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih would be making his first foreign visit to New Delhi on 17 December. Shahid, however, said that on the 'Belt and Road Initiative', the country would continue their cooperation with not only China but with other countries too.

LJP parliamentary board chair Chirag Paswan accused the RLSP chief and Union minister Upendra Kushwaha of rowing in two boats and using pressure tactics to finalise a seat-sharing arrangement between the NDA partners in Bihar by Friday. \"By setting a deadline and taking a stand that he will not talk to anybody except the prime minister, he (Kushwaha) is taking recourse to pressure tactics. Besides, he keeps on speaking against the chief minister. You cannot go on speaking against the NDA constituents while being in the coalition. It is like rowing in two boats,\" Chirag said. Reacting to the young LJP leader's statement, RLSP general secretary Madhaw Anand said the party had been following the coalition dharma ever since they became a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), adding that it needed no lessons from Chirag or his father and LJP president, Ram Vilas Paswan. He made it clear that the RLSP would continue to raise any issue it deemed to be in the interest of the state, irrespective of whether the party was in the NDA or not. \"We do not wish to waste much time on the opinions the other NDA constituents express about us. At present, we are busy with the preparations for our rally in East Champaran on 6 December when Kushwaha would sound the poll bugle for the party,\" Anand added. Kushwaha, a former Janata Dal (United) leader, had floated the RLSP in 2013 and contested the 2014 Lok Sabha poll as an NDA ally, bagging all the three seats it had contested. On the JDU's return to the NDA last year, it was being speculated that the development would upset leaders like Kushwaha and former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha founder Jitan Ram Manjhi, both of whom had burnt their bridges with Kumar. Manjhi had quit the NDA earlier this year, ahead of elections to the Legislative Council, where he secured a berth for his son with the help of the RJD-Congress combine. It was seen as a rebuff to Kushwaha whose party has been demanding a greater share than the JDU, since the RLSP chief belonged to the Koeri caste, which is much more sizeable than Kumar's Kurmi community. Kushwaha's high pitch on the seat-sharing issues has brought him in confrontation with the JDU initially.

Meet Yunus Khan. Khan is a minister in the current Vasundhara Raje Cabinet and has filed his nomination from Tonk Assembly seat. Why is this seat crucial? Because this is the seat where Congress has fielded perhaps their most popular leader of the state, Sachin Pilot. Speaking exclusively to  , Khan answered the questions on Muslim representation in BJP, development policies and Sachin Pilot.  Why were you, an outsider, offered a ticket from Tonk and not the incumbent MLA? All of us are mere workers of the BJP. We have worked as the servants of the people. In the last 5 years, I was responsible for the construction of roads across Rajasthan and the bus transport service. I have visited every corner of the state. Even in Tonk, we constructed roads in all 36 Gram Panchayats. We also provided them national and state highways. So it’s unfair to reduce me to a constituency and call Sachin Pilot a state-wide leader. I entered politics before him. I have worked for this state. It’s okay if he has a tag of state president but I have also served the people in Rajasthan.   Has BJP made you the sacrificial lamb? These are the words of media. I don’t want to comment on it. But, what I will tell you is that on 11 December, the public and BJP workers will show you who is sacrificed and who is the lamb.     But Sachin Pilot is a big Congress leader. Also, Tonk has a significant number of Muslim voters and hence the BJP has fielded you.  I agree that Sachin Pilot has become a taller leader than Ashok Gehlot. I have been campaigning in Tonk. I don’t think that a big face alone will be of much help. This election is between a public servant and a master. I think Tonk’s voters will elect a public servant.   What do you mean when you say ‘master and servant’? I use these terms because Sachin Pilot is the chief of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC). He himself chose to contest from this seat because candidates in Congress are handpicked by Sachin Pilot and his friend Rahul Gandhi. And I call myself a servant because I have served the people of Tonk and Rajasthan. We have ensured that villages are connected to a road. He (Pilot) was an MP and a minister for 10 years and he never paid any attention to the people of Tonk. On the other hand, in all the 170 villages you will find a road constructed, which was commissioned by me.   PM Modi talks about ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ but BJP gives a ticket to just one Muslim candidate in 200 seats.   When a road is constructed or when water connection is provided, then all castes and religions avail the benefits. What about representation from that community?  Every party has its own political reasoning on who to give a ticket to and who not to. Tickets are not distributed on the basis of caste or religion. It depends on how much a person believes in the party’s ideology. I am connected to BJP’s ideology. I am a dedicated party worker. Hence, I am provided with the ticket. If someone else also works for the party then they too will be provided with the ticket.   Will you contest elections on national issues or local issues?   I am not a national leader and hence, I will not go into the national issues. The biggest local issue here is employment and how to create more employment. New industries need to be set up so that more jobs are created. New projects should be announced. These will be my issues. But you were in power for 5 years. Then why is unemployment an issue? Those who have ruined the state and this country for 55 years don’t have the right to demand our 5-year report card. But we will provide a report card. We did provide employment opportunities. We provided 3.25 lakh government jobs. Approximately 18 lakh were employed in private and other sectors. Around 45 lakh were given Mudra loans. So we have provided job opportunities and we want to do more. We are fighting on these issues. We want to increase the pace of development. Otherwise, whenever Congress has come to power, the speed of development has been reduced. We are working to ensure uninterrupted development.   How many seats will the BJP win? BJP will get an absolute majority under the leadership of Vasundhara Raje.   But no one is saying what number of seats. We will win as many seats as we won the last time. Are you feeling the pressure of this high-profile contest?   There is pressure. But not on me. It’s on him who you are calling a stalwart Congress leader.  But surveys show that BJP is trailing. We will talk about it on 11 December at 11 am about who is under pressure, who is the sacrificial lamb and who the surveys support. And we won’t, but TV channels across the world will say that history has been created in Tonk. This election is between Sachin Pilot and the voters of Tonk & BJP workers. This election isn’t about Yunus Khan. If we lose, then it’s my loss but if we win, it will be the victory of Tonk.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Which army teaches to violate ceasefire and kill jawans on the other side? Which army teaches to send people to attack Pathankot and Amritsar? This is cowardliness,” said Singh. Singh was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Kartarpur corridor to connect the Dera Baba Nanak Gurudwara in Gurdaspur to Gurudwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur across the LoC in Pakistan’s Punjab. Vice President of India M Venkaiah Naidu, along with Singh, laid the foundation stone for the corridor. Union Ministers Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Nitin Gadkari were also present. Backing Singh’s comments, Naidu said killing of innocent people will not be tolerated. “I must tell what Punjab CM said, that we can't allow terrorism and can't let innocents die, this isn't going to help, it's not the way; it must be understood. That’s why, let this be the start of this great event,” he said. Singh on Sunday had declined Pakistan's invite to attend the ground-breaking ceremony for the Kartarpur Corridor on the other side of the border, even as his cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu accepted the request. In a letter to Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Singh said though it was a historic occasion, he regretted his inability to be present, citing terror attacks in his state and killings of Indian soldiers by Pakistan troops as the reason. Secondly, the chief minister had claimed that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has started its nefarious activities in Punjab. \"Since March 2017, the state has neutralised 19 ISI-armed and controlled modules, apprehended 81 terrorists and seized 79 weapons, numerous grenades of the HG-84 type made in Pakistan's Ordnance factories with Austrian know how, and some IEDs,\" the chief minister claimed. The last attack took place in Amritsar few days ago, on a peaceful religious congregation in a village. Three people were killed and 19, including children, were wounded, Singh said, adding that the terrorists had been caught. \"I hope that the (Pakistan) prime minister will understand the circumstances... It will not be possible for me to be present in Pakistan on this historic occasion, despite the fact that paying my respects at Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib has always been my cherished dream which will hopefully be fulfilled once these hostilities and killings are stopped,\" he said. Thanking Qureshi for the invitation, Singh recalled his visit to Pakistan as Punjab chief minister in the past. \"As you will see from the stone laid at the Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, it was my grandfather Maharaja Bhupindra Singh who carried out flood protection measures from 1920 to 1929 to protect our gurdwara which was being ravaged by floods in river Ravi each year,\" Singh wrote in the letter. Singh expressed hope that the Pakistan prime minister \"will do all he can to bring the two countries together on the road to peace and friendship.\" (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Several alumni of Symbiosis Law School have told  that they have not yet received Letters of Recommendation (LoR) from the college, despite having applied for the same as per the college’s prescribed procedure. Most, if not all foreign universities of repute require a Letter of Recommendation from a professor who has taught a student during their time in college. Some foreign universities even require two LoRs from the university the student graduated from. They also claimed that many others had also been refused Letters of Recommendation. None of these refusals were made over official communication channels. They were either communicated over the phone, in person, or in some instances, Whatsapp (screengrabs of the same are in  ’s possession). Now, the standard procedure for seeking a Letter of Recommendation from Symbiosis Law School can be found on the   of Symbiosis Law School, Pune. Here’s a screenshot for quick reference. Other students of Symbiosis Law School told  that getting a physical Letter of Recommendation from the college usually takes around two weeks. However, an online LoR doesn’t require the same time. It’s a form sent to the professor in question, and the professor fills out the same and reverts. The first letter was sent to the College’s Chancellor and Vice Chancellor on 30 October, and the second to the Registrar of Symbiosis International Deemed University on 8 November. The subject of both letters was the alumni's concern over the incident of college/hostel authorities   of Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, Apoorva Yarabahalli and Snigdha Jayakrishnan from their college hostel rooms on 26 October, and the Director of Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Shashikala Gurpur reportedly verbally threatening them with rustication. Additionally, the alumni’s letters also asked the administration how CCTV footage of the two girls arguing with the college hostel’s authorities taken from the hostel’s CCTV cameras, also mysteriously found its way onto the internet. Symbiosis International University’s registrar, Dr MS Shejul replied to the first letter on 31 October, stating that disciplinary action was taken against the two girls as part of procedure. The reply added that the college couldn’t comment on the video because the video, which contained footage from the Symbiosis Law School Hyderabad hostel CCTV, wasn’t “sent officially” by the University. At the time of writing this piece, the college has not officially replied to the second letter sent by the alumni on 8 November. Now to be clear, the college has not officially denied or refused students a letter of recommendation. However, the students allege that through unofficial channels, the director of Symbiosis Law School, Pune, Shashikala Gurpur refused Letters of Recommendation. In one exchange on Whatsapp, when the student asked Dr Gurpur (the phone number in question has been verified by  ) about her letter of recommendation, after completing the required procedure, Dr Shashikala Gurpur told the former student that they can’t issue LoRs to students who don’t have faith in the college. The students say, in the Whatsapp exchange, Dr Gurpur refers to the letter sent by the students expressing concern about the college’s action against Apoorva and Snigdha, and refuses to provide the college’s support to students who signed the letter sent to them. Now, remember, this wasn’t over an official channel, but Whatsapp. So, the college hasn’t outright refused or denied an LoR officially. They just haven’t provided one yet. Other students who signed the letters told  that they had written to professors at the college for an LoR, who initially agreed to provide the letters, but were informed later that they needed to get permission from the director, Shashikala Gurpur “according to a new circular.” On 24 November, the college told several alumni to reply from their individual email IDs to the college, CCing the person who sent the original letter, explaining that they were rescinding support to the letter. has mailed a questionnaire to Symbiosis Law School’s director and others concerned. When this reporter reached out to Shashikala Gurpur for a statement after the mail, she replied, “I don’t know you” and hung up. With few options left, and with deadlines for their foreign university and Masters’ degree applications fast approaching, many former students are now faced with a tough choice.

He is an audacious and energetic propagator of his pet ideas. And he coins really smart acronyms to catch the popular imagination. That was apparent when he celebrated India’s leap of 23 spots, from rank 100 to 77, in the EODB (Ease of Doing Business) Index compiled by the World Bank. Modi beamed. He was now tantalizingly close to his target of “getting India into the Top 50”, so you could not grudge him the joy. “Now our effort is to take India to the five-trillion-dollar club as soon as possible”. Several other things were left unsaid too. Most of us assume, quite innocently, that the World Bank’s EODB Index is the gold standard of economic performance. In reality, it’s an extremely narrow, even misleading, summation of a few economic rules which matter to a tiny,  , sliver of India’s vast population. Here are a few eye-opening (popping?) facts: Even more critical is to check what the EODB Index does   take into account (you will be now astonished to see how lethally narrow its underpinning is): Prime Minister Modi’s older echo chamber, the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), had given a dire warning just two days ahead (on 16 November 2018) of his euphoric EODB outing. Although Modi, in another virtuoso act, remained silent on their prophecies of doom (which I am quoting verbatim): But the Gujarat warning was drowned in the EODB din, as Modi conjured up yet another big sounding theme. He announced a “Grand Challenge” for India’s techies to come up with smart ideas in “artificial intelligence, the internet of things, big data analytics and block-chain technologies to streamline and speed up processes”, that would catapult India into the Top 50. He used all the fancy tech terms in vogue to talk up his newest “brain wave”. Two years ago, the income tax department had issued similar notices, slapped taxes, and begun prosecution under the dreaded “angle tax” provisions. It’s an outrageous levy, which places the power to “value” start-ups in the hands of clueless inspectors. Imagine, even the most successful professionals, from private equity and venture capital outfits, get valuations right  . Because valuations, like beauty, lie in the eyes of the beholder! For example, if five investors had valued Flipkart at USD 1 bn, USD 2 bn, USD 3 bn, USD10 bn or USD 15 bn in 2012, who would have been right, and who wrong? Clearly, each person’s valuation would depend on her: Each person would have given different weights to these individual factors, and arrived at any number of different valuations. And each would have been right, because Flipkart was eventually sold for USD 20 bn in 2018. Do you seriously think any of our hypothetical investors would have put money under such a tax regime, where they were being coerced to pay cash taxes on unrealised/uncertain “profits”? Clearly, this tax is a travesty, and tragedy, inflicted on Indian start-ups by Prime Minister Modi. It’s an astonishing repudiation of Stand-up India, Start-up India, Digital India, Make In India and God knows how many more schemes. So, even as Prime Minister Modi got “India Shining” bouquets from his Mumbai/Delhi echo chamber on EODB (Ease of Doing Business), his Gujarati kinsmen and India’s first generation founders, if he had cared to speak to them, would have given a very different “India Taxing” brickbat: Egregious Officers Destroying Business, ie, EODB!

Locals were making a beeline to the waterbody, not to beat the heat, but to see bundles of shredded ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes lying in a heap. A mud track off Jawaharlal Nehru Road in Madhavaram leads to the Retteri lake. On the right is a vast stretch of land. It was in this plot that 36 bundles of the shredded demonetised notes were found dumped. “Someone called the police control room and informed about the bundles. Our team found that three bundles were open and shreds were scattered in the locality,” said a police officer at Madhavaram police station. “We are yet to register a case. It is very difficult to ascertain the total value. However, we are trying to find out how it was brought to the spot,” added the officer. (Source:  ) (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Today the country’s coastal state governments/UTs lack a permanent cadre for its coastal or marine security police wings and personnel posted there for a few years return to other police duties. As a result, the little hands-on exposure that these police personnel obtain to coastal security is lost when they are transferred elsewhere. For state governments, coastal security management proves to be a challenge because it transcends pure police roles and enters the military realm. And the state governments only possess police forces primarily oriented to operate on land and not the sea. Till the central government raises a Central Marine Police Force (CMPF), the proposed academy will train police personnel from the coastal states/UTs in coastal security management, which straddles both military and police functions. Therefore, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavais mooted the proposal to raise a CMPF in June 2016 at a meeting to review the status of the country’s coastal security management in Mumbai. The state has paid serious attention to coastal security due to the earlier LTTE threat from across the Palk Straits. Raised in 1994, the Tamil Nadu Police Coastal Security Group (CSG) is a well-trained force tasked to protect the state’s 1,076-km coastline. The marine/coastal security police forces in the other eight states and four UTs cannot operationally compare with Tamil Nadu’s CSG. The priorities of the Indian Police are political intelligence and VIP security, among other duties. To therefore expect the state police forces to focus on coastal security management is an unrealistic expectation. The fact that the country has poor police to population ratio with just one policeman for 761 people, which translates into approximately 131 policemen per lakh population, does not enable them to ensure effective coastal security management. Moreover, the state police forces across the country are not really oriented to tackle coastal security, and thereby the need for a CMPF which would fill a vital gap in the national security matrix. Importantly, the lack of progress to install fishing boats with transponders which are linked to the land-based Automatic Identification System is a lacuna in the coastal security system, and nullifies progress made on every other front. Every fishing boat with transponders that is tracked amounts to a pair of ‘eyes’ and ‘ears’ at sea becomes part of the coastal security system. Conversely, every boat not in the system remains a potential threat. State governments believe that national security, especially externally fostered internal security threats are the central government’s responsibility, and therefore, rely on the Indian Navy (IN) and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) across peninsular India to tackle sea-borne terrorist threats. However, the problem arises because the IN patrols the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles given the heavy tonnage of their warships; the ICG covers the waters between 12 and 200 nautical miles. The swathe of seas from the coastline to 12 nautical miles which is afloat with a high density of smaller craft like fishing boats, mechanized trawlers and dhows becomes the responsibility of the coastal/marine police forces. The Centre contributes considerably to the coastal security of peninsular India in terms of marine platforms and funds to establish coastal security police stations; besides other hardware like beach scooters and night vision devices. After the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, the central government established the National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security, with the Cabinet Secretary at its helm, to implement the National Maritime Domain Awareness project. The Navy, assisted by the coast guard, state marine police forces, and other state and central agencies undertook this project. Conceptually speaking, the coast guard is inferior to the fighting navy, but superior to the police in terms of marine platforms, weaponry and training, therefore ideally suited for coastal security management. Its first phase was to provide seamless coverage of India's coastline, which includes installation of a chain of 74 Automatic Identification System receivers along the coast and 46 coastal radars around the country’s mainland and the island territories to track small vessel traffic in the coastal waters. Clearly “boots on the seas” or a coastal security force similar to the Border Security Force, standing guard permanently on the country’s land borders, is necessary to complement this technology-driven security infrastructure. Only an active coastal police force could possibly conduct random checks on cargo in these myriad boats sailing on the shallow waters as a deterrent to wrong doers.

Certain details first. The Russians are double agents, in that they were earlier working for the KGB now known as Federal Security Bureau (FSB) and then defected to the MI6 now called the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in Britain. Both Litivinenko and Skripal were poisoned, first one with a rare radioactive isotope – Polonium 210 and the second one with a nerve agent – Novichok. It was timely medical help that saved Skripal’s life, as the MI6 was well prepared to handle another attempted murder on British soil after the shock and shame of being outwitted by the KGB in Litivinenko’s murder. He was killed in a more primitive way, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, initially with fingers being cut off as part of an aggressive interrogation that devolved, resulting in a painful and tortuous death. President Putin once told a journalist who was becoming a nuisance to the government for highlighting the increasing violence against reporters in 2001, “You know Aleksi, you are not a traitor, you are an enemy”. The journalist asked him what was the difference and how on earth was that supposed to be of any comfort? Putin explained, “Enemies are right in front of you, you are at war with them, then you make an armistice with them, and all is clear. A traitor must be destroyed, crushed,” as quoted by Mark Urban in his latest book  . Though Litivinenko, in his dying declaration, directly blamed Putin for his death, the British government did not reveal it to the press at the time, nor did the Independent Enquiry Commission (set up later) blame Putin directly. They however, blamed the State Agencies of Russia for the death of Litvinenko in October 2006 and the near death of Skripal and his daughter in March 2018. Britain reacted to the killing of Litivinenko almost after 10 years when the Enquiry Commission submitted its report in 2016. It had clearly fixed the responsibility for the killing on Andrei Lugovi and Dmitry Kouvtun, both ex-KGB personnel who were colleagues of Litvinenko. Prime Minister Theresa May however, reacted much more sharply to the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter by expelling 23 Russian diplomats and freezing all Russian assets in the UK. More than 20 European allies expelled over 100 Russian diplomats and officials in solidarity with UK. Theresa May told the House of Commons that this was “the largest collective expulsion of Russian Intelligence officers in history”. Such was the European anger against Russia’s brazen methods of eliminating its traitors. The US too followed suit and expelled about 60 Russian diplomats under the Magnitsky Act, though it stopped short of making a formal determination that it had broken international law. The Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act signed by President Obama in December 2012, was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of a Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison in October 2009. In 2016, the bill was extended globally and authorised the US government to punish human rights offenders, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the US. Even as he announced expulsion of Russian diplomats, President Trump appeared as if he was being forced to take the decision under pressure from the ‘Deep State’, as it went against his deep-rooted desire to build a warm personal relationship with Putin. Only Germany took the matter forward by announcing a freeze on arms sale to Saudi Arabia, while questions hung over Khashoggi’s killing, and asked other European nations to follow the lead. Of all the reactions, President Trump’s reaction is the most genuine one, as he makes no bones as to where America’s interests lie. He has clearly refused to listen to the tape handed over by Turkey, nor has he agreed with the assessment made by the CIA that the murder of Khashoggi was ordered by none other than Mohammed bin Salman himself. Trump’s simple argument is that USD 110 billion of arms deal with Saudi Arabia is at stake, and thousands of jobs in the US are at stake. Again it is the ‘Deep State’ (the military – industrial complex) that is guiding President Trump. Trump is all deviance, sans morality. And he sports his deviance like a badge of honour dedicated to a higher cause – ‘America First’. No human rights, no rule of law can supersede that. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

The Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi recently issued 3,800 visas for Sikh pilgrims wanting to visit Pakistan to pay obeisance at Sikh shrines on the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev (the first Guru of the Sikhs) which happens to be on 23 November. A statement issued by the   highlighted the fact, that this is the largest number of visas issued in recent years to Sikh pilgrims. In 2019, Sikhs around the world will be commemorating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The Government of India as well as the Government of Punjab (India) have already listed some of the steps they are likely to take for commemoration (this includes a series of seminars, setting up of chairs at universities) Both sides are at a distance of less than 5 kilometres from each other. Through this corridor, Sikhs will get visa-free access to the historic shrine, and will save them the hassle of travelling all the way to Delhi to secure a visa. While Sidhu’s move to embrace Bajwa was criticised by many in India, including his own party men, he cited the commitment given by Pakistan’s army chief towards opening the religious corridor. This did not spare Sidhu from attacks, with many arguing that he had gone in his personal capacity, and being a minister in the Punjab government, he was in no position to raise the issue. In September 2018, a member of Imran’s Cabinet,   again stated, that irrespective of ties between both countries, Pakistan would open the religious corridor, since it is an issue which pertains to ordinary Sikhs. Later on, as tensions have increased due to repeated militant attacks in Kashmir, as well as the cancellation of talks between Foreign Ministers of India and Pakistan (on the sidelines of the UNGA), Islamabad stated, that the corridor could only go ahead,  The Government of India on its part, first stated that this corridor could only go ahead, if a formal request came from Pakistan, though sections of the security establishment have repeatedly put forward their apprehensions. Even when it seemed that the movement had got a fillip, a   underscored the concerns of intelligence agencies and the army. Congress Member of Parliament  during a visit to the Indian side of the border, stated, “Under the current political scenario, where Pakistani agencies are regularly beheading Indian soldiers, we cannot even think of taking such an initiative.” In spite of a less than enthusiastic New Delhi and an ambivalent Islamabad, activists on the Indian side as well as from the Punjab (Pakistan) Government have continued to raise demands for the religious corridor. In a letter to Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Chief Minister of Punjab (India)   raised the issue, stating that this was of concern to Sikhs. He again took up the issue with the Ministry of External Affairs in November 2018. The Ministry of External Affairs responded by stating that it could not do anything, until it received a formal communication from the Pakistani side. The Government of India recently stated, that it would install a high powered telescope and a screen on the Indian side for a view of the Kartarpur shrine for the benefit of the pilgrims. There was no mention about the issue of the religious corridor. Tensions between both countries have always proven to be an obstacle in people to people linkages between both countries in general, and the two Punjabs in particular; this time it is the Kartarpur Corridor. It is a pity, considering Guru Nanak’s universal message of peace and co-existence. It is also sad, that most Sikhs who want to visit Kartarpur Sahib where the first Guru spent an important phase of his life, are far removed from the politics of the nation-states.

Unrelated intelligence feeds were plugged in to raise the bogey of Islamist terrorism, a much-favoured meme in the current environment where the demonisation of Muslims is a critical instrument of partisan political mobilisation. Zakir Musa and his Ansar Ghazwat ul Hind had come, with their purported Islamic State affiliations, to ‘extend’ his group’s influence into the Punjab. Such claims are undeterred by the fact that Musa and the tiny fragment of the Hizb-ul-Mujahiddeen that he has broken away with, is fighting for its barest survival in Kashmir with a handful of supporters, and is unlikely to harbour ambitions of extension beyond, at this juncture. But if it isn’t Musa, it must be the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM). The movement of a group of JeM terrorists through Punjab and towards Delhi had put the State Police on Red Alert, and so it must be this group who, perhaps wandering by casually, decided to chuck a grenade at the hapless Nirankaris. The very obvious inference – to anyone loosely familiar with the broad trajectory of terrorism in Punjab – that the perpetrators were likely to be tied to a Khalistani formation, seemed entirely to escape the attention of ideologically blinded commentators, but this is what is now unsurprisingly emerging from official pronouncements in Punjab and out of the limited evidence currently available. The Nirankaris – regarded as deviants and blasphemers by the Khalistanis (and the Akalis) – have long been a favourite target of the extremists. Indeed, it is useful to recall that the 15-year nightmare of terrorism in Punjab commenced with the targeting of the Nirankaris by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his Damdami Taksal followers in 1978, culminating in the murder of the head of the sect, Satguru Gurbachan Singh, in April 1980. The one consistent element in the continuous efforts to revive Khalistani terrorism in Punjab has been the role of Pakistan’s ISI, and it is likely to be confirmed in the present case as well. For one thing, almost all major active Khalistani formations have a base in Pakistan and are openly supported by the Army’s intelligence wing. Prominent among these are the Babbar Khalsa International, the Khalistan Zindabad Force, the International Sikh Youth Federation, Dal Khalsa International, the Khalistan Commando Force – Panjwar and the Khalistan Tiger Force. Several past operations, as well as large numbers of arrests and seizures of weapons in Punjab over the years have been linked to these formations. Equally significantly, cells affiliated to these groups, as well as prominent overground Khalistani organisations across the world, receive support from the ISI and Pakistani diplomatic missions, and this was visible in the orchestration of the recent Referendum 2020 demonstration at Trafalgar Square, where potential participants from Pakistan were offered an all expenses paid four-day trip to London. The K-2 project, a plan to ‘unite’ Kashmiri and Khalistani terrorist formations, has been a long term effort on the part of the ISI, though the obvious ideological divergence between Islamist and Sikh fundamentalist terrorist formations have kept any real unity of purpose out of reach over the decades. Nevertheless, some limited operational cooperation has been evidenced in the past, and cannot be excluded in the present or future. Groups like JeM and Lashkar-e-Taiba are fully owned enterprises of the ISI, and if told to support specific Khalistani operations, would do so. Such operational cooperation must remain a cause of concern for intelligence and enforcement agencies in the Punjab. The attack at the Nirankar Bhawan has also drawn the usual accusations of intelligence failure – and, of course, every terrorist success does, in some sense, indicate a failure of the intelligence system. However, in most cases it is only in our fantasies that we will be able to discover or predict the specifics of every potential attack to the levels of precision necessary for effective preventive action. It is useful to remind ourselves that the Raja Sansi attack would have taken little more than a few seconds to execute, and could, in fact, have occurred anywhere across Punjab. No country in the world can ever have a security apparatus that can prevent every such possibility. Indeed, numerous intelligence and enforcement successes over the past years elude public attention, since they are seldom reported, or at best, are reported as the arrests of ‘suspected terrorists’, and provoke little interest. The revival of Khalistani terrorism at a scale that threatens the state apparatus remains highly unlikely; the terrorists, however, backed by Pakistan’s state system and by elements in a wealthy diaspora, will ‘get lucky’ from time to time. Crucially, there is no scope for complacence in the face of any measure of terrorism, and no way to predict possible triggers of abrupt escalation. Some political sagacity – instead of the current proclivity to inflame the situation with partisan posturing – will be necessary if Punjab is not to be pushed into an escalatory cycle, however limited.

But why this sudden change in India's policy towards the Dalai Lama? It's an open secret that in the Modi dispensation only one man's writ prevails on all issues - PM Modi. At this juncture, nothing matters more to Modi and the BJP than winning the next general elections, due by April-May 2019 but may well be advanced by a few months. China can rock Modi's boat in a big way. That's why, from Modi's perspective, it is absolutely essential that China cooperates with the Modi government and not create problems. To seek China's cooperation, the Modi government has extended an olive branch to China on its soft underbelly, the Dalai Lama, who is dubbed by China as a “splittist” and a “dangerous separatist”. This is the only explanation for cabinet secretary PK Sinha sending a note (dated February 22 but sent on February 26 presumably after PMO's vetting) to all central ministries and departments as well as all state governments which says \"senior leaders\" and \"government functionaries\" of the Centre and states should stay away from commemorative events planned for March-end and early April by the \"Tibetan leadership in India\" to mark the start of 60 years in exile of the Dalai Lama. The main event of Dalai Lama targeted by the Modi government is \"Thank You India\" being organised at  in New Delhi on April 1. Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile also intends to invite a number of Indian dignitaries for this event which is likely to be followed up by additional events in Delhi as well as other Indian states. Significantly, the cabinet secretary's circular was sent on the advice of the new foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale who until a few months back was Indian ambassador in China and had played a key role in resolution of the 73-day-long Doklam standoff. The cabinet secretary quoted Gokhale’s note to underline “the sensitive nature of the subject”. In his note to the cabinet secretary the foreign secretary stated: “The proposed period will be a very sensitive time in the context of India’s relations with China. Participation by senior leaders or government functionaries, either from the central government or state governments, is not desirable, and should be discouraged.” Modi knows that China is seething over India's unprecedented defiance and a strong stand over the Doklam issue last summer. Although the crisis was resolved after 73 days, Modi has been tipped off by his intelligence apparatus that China may trigger a bigger crisis in Doklam and elsewhere in this summer. Such a scenario would be politically disastrous for Modi, who during the 2014 election campaign had hauled the then Congress government over coals for its submissive approach to China. In the event of China triggering yet another major flashpoint, the Modi government would be pushed on the back foot and the Congress-led Opposition will get a stick to beat the BJP with in the run-up to the next general elections. Only yesterday (March 5)  told parliament that China has built helipads and trenches in Doklam. It's because of this that Modi has turned India's six-decade-old foreign policy on its head. As per Modi's political calculations a possible China-triggered flashpoint would be more harmful for his political future than turning his back on the Dalai Lama. At best, the Opposition would cry foul and issue angry statements against the move, but China would be mollified. Had there been a strong and United Opposition, it would have made life miserable for the government and the prime minister, accusing the government of being soft and pliable and reversing decades-old Indian policy for his short-term political gains. The Opposition has solid reasons to blast the Modi government as it has unilaterally changed a vital component of Indian foreign policy without taking the Opposition into confidence. And that too at a time when the Modi government should have done exactly the opposite after China recently violated two bilateral MoUs and refused to share upstream data on  and cut off Indian pilgrims' access to two sacred sites in Tibet. The Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement on March 2, a national holiday on account of the Holi festival, and said thus: “The government’s position on His Holiness the Dalai Lama is clear and consistent. He is a revered religious leader and is deeply respected by people of India. There is no change in that position. He is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India.” However, the MEA kept mum on the cabinet secretary's note. The Modi government is exercising more caution than ever before in dealing with China not just because PM Modi will be travelling to China in June this year for attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. But it's not for this multilateral event that he has changed his government’s policy on the Dalai Lama in one stroke. He is eyeing much bigger prize in lieu: an India visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is now practically the Chinese president for life after the Chinese Communist Party made changes in its rules. A visit to India by Xi later this year would effectively mean that the Xi-led China won't be rocking India's boat and would presumably refrain from staging the much feared Doklam II. The master political move by Modi makes it clear that it’s more by Modi the politician, rather than Modi, the prime minister.","title":"Why Modi government is willing to snub the Dalai Lama to pacify China","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/the-dalai-lama-event-delhi-modi-government-india-china-ties-thank-you-india/story/1/22695.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15246},{"author":"DS Rai","content":"For the past 14 years, Madhya Pradesh has been ruled by the BJP. And even though many in the state think that the BJP is invincible, a desire for change is gradually gaining strength.   It seems that the people of the state may finally choose the Congress over the BJP. This is also indicated by the Congress’s successive wins in four by-elections in the past one year. However, going by the full-page advertisements of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in local newspapers, an uninformed observer is likely to conclude that Chouhan is as popular as before. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was once his contemporary, Chouhan too has made elections his priority, and often at the cost of governance.   In the past decade, the chief minister has projected every election victory (big or small) as his own alone.   Unsurprisingly, his detractors believe that the Madhya Pradesh chief minister often ignores government work for election work.  However, with recent losses in by-elections, Chouhan’s critics in his party have been quick to lay the blame for the loss at CM’s door. One of those is former BJP MP Raghunandan Sharma who said, that the loss in the Mungaoli and Kolaras by-elections was \"failure of one person and not of the party\". In the past 12 years of Chouhan’s rule, the BJP-RSS combine (it’s hard to distinguish between them in MP), have ensured that their workers and functionaries are benefitted financially, often, through government contracts, tenders and schemes. Most of the public works are now executed by BJP workers-turned-contractors. A majority of the state’s locally elected bodies like \"mandis\", marketing and cooperative societies and municipal bodies are now controlled by the BJP and so is the flow of government funds. The BJP-RSS and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government have made it routine to organise massive functions in the name of festivals, anniversaries and occasions at huge costs incurred by the state exchequer. In addition to such functions, a number of other religion-based events are organised by the BJP-RSS  network of cadres and workers. BJP MLAs and local leaders in their constituencies and areas of influence replicate this template of event management. These are almost always conducted in the presence of priests and \"godmen\" of questionable reputations. Unsurprisingly, those of us living in MP have not failed to notice a sharp growth in the number of religious (Hindu) events and pseudo-religiosity in the state over the past decade or so. More shockingly perhaps, even government officers are expected to use their clout and arrange for logistics and even crowds for such events. Under the threat of falling out of favour with their political bosses, the officers quietly do as expected.   A large number of government-appointed or government-dependent ASHA and Aanganwadi workers as well panchayat secretaries form a bulk of crowds at such gatherings. In fact, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has become so brazen that is has been issuing formal orders to district collectors and other officers asking them to bring in crowds. The most recent example of this is a meeting of workers organised in Jabalpur on February 24.  Naturally, governance is the loser in all of this. Although government officers are not given to airing their views publicly, the fact is that all over the state, officers are fed up of doing what is essentially the political work of the government for more than a decade. My own sense is that most of them genuinely want a change in government in the upcoming assembly elections in the state. They are so pestered by the government that whenever a retired bureaucrat happens to talk about the \"good old days\", they bluntly retort, \"Sir, please don’t talk about those days. Things have change drastically since then\". While the BJP has been successful in expanding its base across castes and tribes, often through religious gurus, the Congress has all, but lost its traditional voter base among Muslims, STs, and SCs.   In the 2013 Assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, these communities voted massively in favour of the BJP.   In many areas of the state, the Congress doesn’t even have booth-level workers, the BJP, on the other hand, has acquired remarkable expertise on booth management. However, the upcoming Assembly elections are going to be Congress’s best shot at unseating the BJP from power. According to some surveys there have been more than 150 scams covering many ministries in the MP government in the past years. The biggest and the most infamous of these is the Vyapam (recruitment and admission) scam.  Although it has to be  remembered that the Congress has so far not been able to \"exploit\" these scams to its own political advantage. The reason for this is an open secret: Congress is a divided house in Madhya Pradesh. Its four major leaders, Kamalnath, Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Arun Yadava have shared a public stage barely once in the past year.  With just a few months to go before the elections, a planned endeavour to reach out to the state’s people is still not visible. The grand old party’s problems are further compounded by a crippling crunch of funds  - an area in which the BJP is far ahead. A large section of Congress workers and the general public believe that only with Scindia as its CM-nominee does the part have any chance of defeating the BJP.   The reasons for this are three-fold: Scindia enjoys a clean image, has freshness of approach and youthful appearance, and is a good orator.   If Scindia is soon declared the Congress’s chief ministerial candidate and allowed to work with a free hand then the party will be able to galvanise public mood in its favour. However, the Congress is known to remain in hibernation until the last moment and for not taking the right decisions at the right time.   Scindia too needs to step out of his traditional fiefdom of Guna and Gwalior and reach out to the entire state if he is to be a serious contender to incumbent chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Despite the handicaps mentioned above, the Congress can come back to power because the people of the state desperately want a change.  Whether it is on social indices like IMR, MMR, malnutrition and education, or crimes against women, Dalits and children, Madhya Pradesh is at the bottom of the spectrum. A large section of people in the state depends on agriculture and feels that it has neither been getting its due nor any real and meaningful sympathy despite a large number of farm suicides in the state. Along with this, corruption has become rampant in the state and has infected every level and arm of the government. There is no respect for government administration and credibility of government is at an all-time low; ideas like the \"Ministry of Happiness\" only underscore the grave intellectual and policy-level bankruptcy of the government. The only visible signs of any development in the state are roads and improved electricity supply, but these too are now crumbling because of corruption and mismanagement. In short, the people of MP want change, but the question is: can Congress get its act together in time to be an alternative?","title":"14 years of BJP rule in Madhya Pradesh: Will Congress pull through?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/madhya-pradesh-assembly-elections-bjp-shivraj-singh-chouhan-congress/story/1/22689.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15247},{"author":"Ashok K Singh","content":"BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Monday was gloating in triumphalism over the takedown of a   from Tripura’s Belonia College Square. Within 48 hours of notching up a stunning victory in the Assembly elections, Ram Madhav (in his tweet) appeared to suggest, that removal of a life size bronze statue of Lenin was a historical task accomplished. He, however, later deleted the tweet. The “Chalo Paltai” crowd went on razing sculpture, attacking CPI(M) workers and party offices after “takhta palat” (dethroning) of the Manik Sarkar-led government. After a storm of protest on social media,   spoke to the Tripura governor and the state police chief and asked them to ensure peace before the swearing-in of the new government. BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli offered a poor damage-control defence of what could be construed as instigation to party workers to indulge in vandalism. “BJP doesn’t ever practice culture of violence. In places like Tripura, Left parties have chosen to be silent about 11 BJP workers who were killed. Some of those who support Left parties are trying to foist these kind of debates that a statue is removed,” Kohli told ANI. However, Tripura governor   have condoned the act of vandalism. The governor said, \"What one democratically elected government can do another democratically elected government can undo. And vice versa.\" Swamy was more forthright. \"Lenin is a foreigner and in a way, a terrorist, there shouldn't be a statue of this sort of person in our country? They are welcome to put that statue inside the Communist Party headquarters and worship it if they so wish,\" he told ANI. Statues are inanimate objects. They become important when emotions get attached to them. Inanimate objects turn into living memorials and become part of history and folklore. BJP workers can remove Lenin’s statue, but can they erase history? The Left Front government that was in power in Tripura for a quarter of a century, in two installments, has been defeated. But those 25 years can’t be erased from public memory and history. In the current Assembly itself, the CPI(M) represents 45 per cent of the total electorate. The share of votes has not been translated into seats, but that’s a vagary of our electoral system. The BJP can’t erase 45 per cent of the people. On Twitter and other social media platforms, BJP supporters defended the statue’s takedown by venting their ire against CPI(M)’s foreign-influenced ideology. Lenin, a Russian by birth, has no place on the Indian soil, they argued. Are they sure the BJP’s ideology has no ingredients of foreign influence? Are they sure the Guruji’s   entertained no foreign influence? Those very people who get so revolted by foreign influences had organised havans and pujas for the victory of the US President Donald Trump. They thought a new avatar was born in the US who would slay the evil forces residing in the West. The avatar has done no favours to those who sought god’s benediction for him. The Modi government and the people of India were rightly hurt when Ghana decided in October 2016 to remove the statute of  . More than 1,000 university teachers and academics in Ghana had signed an online petition to their government demanding removal of the statue in protest against what they called Gandhiji’s “racist identity”. The statue was erected there barely a couple of months earlier after the then President Pranab Mukherjee had gifted it to Ghana. Gandhiji’s sculpture was shifted from the university square hurriedly lest it could be vandalised. As for Lenin and his sculptures, there could be no more alien place to have a status of Lenin than the US, which the BJP the Modi government are so much enamoured of. This writer was surprised to see a statue of Lenin standing at a prominent public corner in Seattle, the US during a visit there some years ago. The Russian communist revolutionary who is so reviled in the mecca of capitalism has become a landmark in Seattle along with the famous Fremont Troll sculpture in the quirky and artistic neighbourhood of the city. Lenin’s sculpture is on tourists’ itinerary in the city that headquarters Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing and is home to the billionaire Bill Gates. The Seattle city council periodically comes under pressure from the communist baiters to remove the statue. However, there are some who oppose the move. None of those who oppose the removal are communists. Some of them favour seeing Lenin as a relic of the past, some are reminded of the Cold War that tormented the US and some recollect the dreaded years of living under Soviet nuclear arms threat. For some, the 16-foot-tall statute is just an object of curiosity. Seattle’s Lenin statue has an interesting history. In 1981, Czechoslovakia’s communist party commissioned Bulgarian sculptor Emil Venkov for Lenin’s sculpture that was installed in 1988. In 1989, it was taken down during the Velvet Revolution and was lying in a scrapyard until an American teacher of English Lewis E Carpenter came across it, bought it and carted it to Seattle in 1993. It has been standing in Fremont neighbourhood since then. Relics of Soviet Union and the most potent symbol of communist ideology, Vladimir Lenin, no longer pose threat to America. The capitalist oligarchy of Vladimir Putin does. The Seattle city council has kept the sculpture on tourists’ must-see itinerary because Lenin poses no threat to the people over there. But the BJP seems to be haunted by the spectre of Lenin. It has to dismantle sculptures, art and history associated with Lenin lest the politics associated with the relics might come alive. That’s a possibility the BJP has to contend with.","title":"What bulldozing Lenin statue in Tripura says about BJP's brazen politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-lenin-statue-bjp-cpm-ram-madhav-chalo-paltai-governor-tathagata-roy-subramanian-swamy/story/1/22691.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15248},{"author":"Anand Kochukudy","content":"Extending its poor run in Assembly elections since losing power at the Centre in 2014, Congress has been completely wiped out from Tripura and Nagaland. It has also   despite emerging as the single-largest party in the state. As had happened in Goa and Manipur in 2017, the BJP has come from behind to cobble together a rainbow alliance in Meghalaya with merely 2 MLAs. While Congress did show some decisiveness in sending its top troubleshooter Ahmed Patel along with senior leaders Kamal Nath and Mukul Wasnik to the state quickly, it was apparently too late in the day. The Congress' lack of foresight in anticipating all kinds of results was once again sorely exposed even as BJP's Ram Madhav and Himanta Biswas Sarma ensured that they struck a deal in less than 24 hours. Congress has been ruling Meghalaya since 2003 but for a year's break in 2008. The resultant anti-incumbency and BJP holding power at the Centre played its part in non-Congress parties coming together, facilitated by the BJP. In the bargain, the National People's Party (NPP) led by  , son of the late Purno Sangma, has emerged as the leader of the alliance with 19 MLAs, supported by regional parties UDP, HSPDP and the newly formed PDF. Sangma paraded 34 MLAs as he went to meet the governor on Sunday evening, March 4, and will be sworn in as the chief minister on Tuesday. The BJP's stated aim of a \"Congress-mukt Bharat\" is becoming a reality at a faster pace than anybody would have imagined with the grand old party now relegated to merely three full-fledged states - Punjab, Karnataka and Mizoram. Karnataka goes to polls in a couple of months and Mizoram at the end of this year. Rahul Gandhi's  at another crucial moment has invited criticism from all corners and deservedly so. In fact, Congress campaign in all three northeastern states that went to polls in February was low-key and Rahul Gandhi visited Meghalaya just a couple of times in the run-up to the elections. It almost seemed that the Congress was resigned to losing the polls even before the election. This lethargy despite putting up an impressive performance in Gujarat and claiming moral victory doesn't bode well as general elections are due next year. With BJP aggressively expanding in state after state in every region, Congress seems to have worked out the opposite strategy of putting all their eggs in one basket and concentrating on a single state at a time like regional outfits. While all their energy was focussed on Gujarat earlier, it seems Karnataka has now replaced Gujarat as the focal point. While the electoral significance of Karnataka cannot be understated, this strategy is not likely to work against the marauding BJP if Congress wishes to retain its position as the national alternative. It parallels the strategy adopted by the Left in the heydays of Indira Gandhi when they were reduced to an insignificant force in the Hindi belt. The obvious problem with this strategy is that, even after putting all their resources to use in Gujarat, Congress still came up short. And in Karnataka, despite being on a solid wicket, anything less than an outright win will surely prompt the JDS to strike an alliance with the BJP (despite assurances to the contrary by Deve Gowda) and displace Congress. The pre-poning of the general elections to coincide with the Assembly elections to Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram is predicated on such a result. While Congress leaders claim off the record that a severe cash crunch is one of their biggest constraints, it simply cannot be an excuse for a party that ruled New Delhi for two terms in the immediate past, apart from its legacy since independence. The Nagaland Congress unit has been on record claiming that they were left to fend for themselves as the party merely put up candidates in 18 of the 60 constituencies. Even in Tripura, where the Congress got 45 per cent of the vote share in the 48 seats it contested in 2013, the party drew a blank this time on account of the apathy of the central leadership thereby ceding its space in entirety to the BJP. This kind of mismanagement is criminal and the Congress cannot afford it at this crucial juncture. The Northeast region's eight states command a total of 25 seats, 14 of them in Assam alone. And Congress' diminishing fortunes in the region can be traced back to the events leading up to the Assembly elections in Assam in 2016 and Himanta Biswas Sarma's revolt and alleged humiliation by Rahul Gandhi. It seems Congress is still paying for   as Sarma is not only key to BJP in Assam but hugely popular in adjacent states as well. BJP made him the convener of the North East Democratic alliance (NEDA) formed to bring all the non-Congress parties under the NDA umbrella and it has paid off spectacularly for the party once only known for its existence in the Hindi belt. Congress had long ignored the electoral significance of Northeast and had depended on being in power at the Centre and the \"intelligence network\" that runs parallel to elected governments in some of these states. True, BJP seems to have deep pockets and an unlimited supply of cash through its capitalist friends and other sources. But sadly, Congress hasn't learned much from the disasters in Goa and Manipur, where they had emerged as the single-largest party but was outsmarted by the BJP. Or, it could be argued that smaller parties have been wary of the Congress' inability to keep its flock together in Arunachal Pradesh and BJP's ability to induce legislators to switch sides. Congress could do better than having just CP Joshi as the pointsman for its strategy in the Northeast by having a designated general secretary in-charge for every state, however big or small. The feudal system of extending patronage and keeping decision-making centralised, especially after losing power in New Delhi, is not fit for the politics of the day and the party is learning it the hard way. It's time Congress delegated more powers to the lower levels and improved its man management. Despite being hamstrung by corruption allegations and the ban on coal mining getting pinned on them, the party still came up with a decent performance against a fragmented Opposition but still couldn't form a government. The blame for this situation rests squarely with the central leadership of Congress that has once again been caught napping. With its failure to negotiate a deal with the Samajwadi Party to be the sole contestant in the Phulpur by-election against the BJP, everything now rests on Karnataka for Indian National Congress.","title":"Congress failing to form government in Meghalaya is a new low","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/meghalaya-meghalaya-assembly-elections-northeast-elections-congress-amit-shah-bjp/story/1/22668.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15249},{"author":"Sharat Pradhan","content":"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo   on Sunday, March 4, to support the Samajwadi Party (SP) in by-polls to two Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh later this month has come as a big surprise to all those who have been witness to the bitterness that has prevailed between the two parties for nearly three decades. No wonder, there is great scepticism among political observers, who are seeing beyond what meets the eye in the development. Visibly, this may appear to be a good beginning towards a \"mahagathbandhan\" (grand alliance) against the increasingly powerful Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, this could also be a ploy on the part of a shrewd Mayawati to make an entry into the Rajya Sabha. Without spelling out her own political ambitions, she went on record to state, \"I would expect Samajwadi Party to support the BSP nominee for Rajya Sabha, while we would extend support to their candidate in the state legislative council.\" Refraining from describing the move as a precursor to a \"mahagathbandhan\", she sought to clarify, \"All that my party men have resolved to do is to extend support to the party that has the best potential to give BJP a run for its money at the forthcoming by-elections to two Lok Sabha seats in UP.\" The by-poll is due on March 11 in  , the two prominent parliamentary constituencies, vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, respectively. Both have got berths in the state legislative council (upper house of the state legislature). Theoretically, Mayawati's announcement means a lot and is seen as a \"good beginning\" towards the formation of a grand alliance against the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But it may be too far-fetched to assume that this last-minute declaration would make any major impact on the by-elections. The announcement notwithstanding, whether it would be possible for Mayawati to transfer her party's votes to the Samajwadi Party within such a short span of time remains a million dollar question. After all, BSP supporters are largely the economically weaker Dalits, who have little access to television news. Even we were to assume that they do have access to the TV news, it may not prove so simple to convince a fairly large section of Dalits to vote for a party believed to be dominated by Yadavs, who are considered the biggest oppressors of the downtrodden Dalits. It would have been a different matter if the move was to be treated as the first step towards a Bihar like grand alliance against the BJP. But such a grand alliance would not be complete till the Congress joins in. Mayawati's announcement hasn't come without preconditions, the foremost being SP's support for a Rajya Sabha berth. Each aspirant for Rajya Sabha requires a minimum of 38 votes from members of the state Assembly. With a paltry strength of just 17 in the UP Assembly, Mayawati was far short of numbers which she could get only from Samajwadi Party, which has a strength of 46. Here too what Mayawati is understood to have demanded that the SP gives the BSP Rajya Sabha candidate its first preference votes to ensure a smooth sail. The SP can do so only by sacrificing its own candidate. In the event of SP pushing its own nominee first, it would have only 8 surplus votes to be passed on to Mayawati. Now, assuming that additional support of Congress party's seven members would also be forthcoming, Mayawati would still remain six short of the desired figure of 38. That is the reason Mayawati is understood to be insisting on ensuring the first preference support from SP. Evidently, while both SP and BSP have been busy proclaiming that their main objective is to fight \"communal forces\" (read BJP), the fact of the matter is that Mayawati is seeking her pound of flesh from SP. Relations between Mayawati and then SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav soured after SP supporters assaulted BSP legislators and even tried to storm into Mayawati's room in the UP government's State Guest House way back on June 2, 1995, after she withdrew support from the Mulayam-led SP-BSP coalition government. With the passage of time, the relations worsened as Mayawati continued to believe that SP's attack on the guest house was actually an attempt on her life. After the Yadav family feud culminated in SP's rout in the  , Akhilesh Yadav was often heard expressing his inclination to join hands with the BSP. Now that Mulayam is virtually out of the Akhilesh's scheme of things, Mayawati has chosen to let bygones be bygones. Surely, it is a testing time for Akhilesh who is now clearly in a tight corner. In order to prove that he really meant to combat \"communal forces\", he would have to abdicate his party's claim to the only Rajya Sabha seat available to it. However, there can be no doubt that SP's tactical sacrifice could change the dynamics of the 2019 general elections.","title":"Truth behind why Mayawati is aligning with SP","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mayawati-akhilesh-yadav-uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2019-general-elections-mulayam-singh-yadav/story/1/22659.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15250},{"author":"Rajdeep Sardesai","content":"Maybe it's the skill of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convert every state election into a \"national\" battle, but never before has an election result to three small states in the Northeast attracted such media attention. So here are my 10 takeaways from the battle for the Northeast, the first big election verdict of 2018. 1) The BJP is by some considerable distance the country's premier national party. It isn't just the fact that the BJP is in power in 21 states, it's just how rapidly they have expanded their geographical footprint. When they came to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP was in government in just half a dozen states; from there to their present status in the span of just four years is a quite remarkable achievement. Narendra Modi and Amit Shah must take a lot of credit because they have quite clearly reinvented election strategies: a robust 24x7 campaigning style that is relentless and rewarding. There may be just five Lok Sabha seats at stake between Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland, and the results may have no impact on the 2019 general elections or the next big state battle in Karnataka in May, but the BJP's presence in government in all three states gives the Modi-Shah combine the psychological ascendancy once again, a conviction that it remains electorally on a roll (that it has also happened just on the eve of a Parliament session is a side benefit in ensuring clever headline management in the times of Nirav Modi and bank defaults!) 2) Tripura is the ultimate proof of the BJP's formidable election machine, arguably the most effective vote gathering juggernaut in Independent India. To win a state where in the previous election,   is a swing in fortunes that is unprecedented. No single factor is responsible: a focussed leadership, a strong RSS cadre based organisation, artful booth management, plentiful resources, a strategic if risky tie-up with a local tribal outfit, a weakened Congress, a fatigued Left, have all come together to allow the lotus to bloom in Agartala. But above all else, it's the audacity of ambition that is impressive: Who would have thought tiny Tripura would be so firmly on the BJP's radar? In fact, when Amit Shah spoke of the BJP targeting Tripura as a \"growth\" state a few years ago, there was a measure of incredulity in the response even from those within the party; now, he is seen as a modern day Chanakya! That a cadre-based right was able to challenge a cadre-based Left on its home turf and win must make this victory smell particularly sweet. 3) No election is won by individuals alone. The BJP has a \"team\" with Modi as the all powerful general, Shah as his deputy but crucially, enough local level commanders to spearhead the charge.   has proved himself as a man for all seasons from Kashmir to Kohima; Himanta Biswa Sarma is the BJP's Northeast army corps commander and the BJP Tripura in-charge Sunil Deodhar is the anonymous battalion leader who can inspire troops (karyakartas) into a tough battle. Deodhar, like Modi, is a RSS \"pracharak\", the kind of nuts and bolts committed organisation man that the other parties so desperately lack at the moment. Deodhar doesn't want to be Rajya Sabha MP, doesn't want to be a minister, just is an old fashioned political activist who has put party and ideology above self, spending years building the RSS shakha network across the Northeast. 4) The BJP has leveraged its four years at the Centre and two years in power in Assam to build a strong equation with potential allies in the Northeast. The relationship may be transactional at one level and often leveraged through money power (every Northeast government depends on central funding) but by forging a broad North East Democratic alliance, there is a genuine platform which has been created to address grievances. That the PM has himself invested time and personal equity in consciously projecting a \"look/act east\" policy - holding major central government meetings in a Guwahati and Shillong is one step - has helped build a trust quotient that has made it easier to stitch convenient regional alliances. 5) The BJP has also shown the political \"flexibility\" to \"customise\" its agenda to address diverse constituencies. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asauddin Owaisi was once quoted as saying, \"For the BJP, beef is mummy in Delhi and yummy in the north east.\" He wasn't wrong. But what the BJP's rivals will see as duplicity could well be explained as a recognition of a diverse cultural ethos by a party which for the longest time was defined by a \"Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan\" brand of politics. The dissonance may still rear its head in the future but that the BJP has been able to make itself \"acceptable\" in Christian dominated Nagaland and Meghalaya is not without significance. Yes, the BJP won just two seats in Meghalaya and is a marginal party in Nagaland, and has ridden to power by \"deal-making\" with regional parties but there is clearly no ideological isolation or political untouchability of the kind that haunted the BJP in the 1990s. It is interesting that the hill parties of Meghalaya, for example, chose the BJP to form a government with when they had the option of siding with the Congress (even the Sangmas of the BJP's Meghalaya ally NPP were once a Congress family). Nagaland is less of a surprise: Naga parties have traditionally chosen to deal with whoever is in power at the Centre. Of greater concern here is the Nagaland framework agreement signed with Naga militant groups in 2015 but still not made public and whether the agreement will lead to a more durable peace. 6) The Congress, once the dominant force of the Northeast, is now a party in retreat. In 2014, the Congress was in power in five of the states in the region; now, it just has tiny Mizoram to show for itself. What happened in Arunachal was morally indefensible but the Congress leadership did itself no favours by procrastinating in a crisis. In Manipur, a strong local satrap like Ibobi Singh at least offered a challenge. Elsewhere, the party has allowed a familiar rust and decay to set in, symbolic of its overall national health. Tripura is a good example. The BJP made its initial inroads in Tripura primarily because the Congress just evaporated, first taken over by the Trinamool Congress and then the BJP. It's the 36 per cent Congress vote of 2013 that was reduced to single digits in 2018. The party's campaign in Tripura never took off, it contested just 18 seats in Nagaland, and allowed the situation to drift in Meghalaya till it was too late. Its general secretary for the Northeast, CP Joshi, has earned the dubious reputation of being a leader who can snatch defeat from victory if required (the Congress has just split in Bihar, another state which he presides over). Contrast Joshi's lethargy with the raw energy of a Biswa Sarma, the BJP's Assam-based go getting leader. To think that Biswa Sarma was dyed in the wool Congressman till just over two years ago is another reminder of how easily the party has squandered its own talent by choosing not to empower those who may challenge the status quo with their ambition and desire. 7) After its \"moral\" victory in Gujarat and an impressive showing in the Rajasthan by-elections, the Congress leadership convinced itself that it was on the right track to recovery. Rahul Gandhi's ascent to party presidentship was seen as a sign that the first family of the party was back in business. And yet,   in the Northeast only confirm the suspicion that he is still a work in progress, alternately confident and casual, a well-intentioned leader still unable to lead aggressively and consistently from the front. Gandhi only addressed one meeting in Tripura on the last day of the campaign and ignored Nagaland altogether. May be, it was a lost cause in any case but what is the message to the party workers if the leader gives up so easily? Rahul was more assertive in Meghalaya where the party was in the race but here again he might have been better off spending a full week campaigning in the state rather than dashing off to launch his Karnataka campaign, a state where elections are still a few months away. Perhaps, the final proof of Rahul's on-off approach to politics was when he chose to spend the results weekend in Italy with his \"Nani\". Nothing wrong in surprising your grand-ma with a \"hug\", but surely that could have waited till the election results were out. The optics are once again misconceived: this is a week to be hugging your candidates who have won, grandma perhaps can wait! Rahul's supporters may insist that time is on their side, but time waits for no one, and may be running out rapidly ahead of the 2019 general elections. Winning Karnataka (and later in the year, Rajasthan) is make or break for the Congress leadership's immediate political calculations. 8) Like the Congress, the Left too needs to go back to the drawing board. A few months ago, when I suggested to a Left leader in Delhi that the BJP might offer a real challenge in Tripura, I was brushed aside: \"You journalists are easily swayed by Modi-Shah's media blitz. Tripura is not Gujarat!\" Indeed, Tripura was not Gujarat. While in Gujarat, the BJP was able to fight off a 25 year anti-incumbency, in Tripura, a mix of complacency and arrogance meant that winning a sixth election in a row was a bridge too far. Yes,   and we could celebrate his being the country's \"poorest\" CM but he was also ultimately a one man show. Yes, he brought peace and stability to the border state, but peace cannot guarantee jobs. As its Tripura model unravelled, the CPM has chosen to blame the BJP for misusing money power rather than look within. Living in denial won't help the Left: its precipitous decline in neighbouring Bengal is a consequence of this intransigent attitude. With 42 per cent of the vote, the Left still retains a solid core base in Tripura, but its ideology needs to attract the younger voters in particular to remain relevant. 9) As politics gets localised, every state result must be seen in isolation. An impressive BJP triumph in Tripura for example doesn't necessarily mean that the party will make similar strides in Left ruled Kerala or, indeed, in Bengal, the other potential \"growth\" state. But there is growing evidence to suggest that the BJP is rapidly occupying the spaces vacated by the Congress to emerge as a challenger to existing political alignments in states where once the Congress was the premier national force. Expect Odisha to be the more immediate potential \"target\" state in 2019 with Bengal and Kerala also on the radar. And yet, the main challenge for the BJP to remain on top in 2019 is retaining its bastions in north and west India. 10) Personally, the best news for me is the fact that the dramatic rise of the BJP in the Northeast has forced the news media, and TV in particular, to focus on a neglected region. I have often called it the \"tyranny of distance\" but the fact is that the Northeast has been in real danger of falling off the national news map. That it has taken a landmark election result in Tripura to reduce the gap between Agartala and national news headquarters is a positive sign. Hopefully, although I rather doubt it, we will be forced to keep our gaze on the region beyond just another exciting T20 like election counting day! Next stop Karnataka!

Justice Joseph, as the chief justice of the Uttarakhand High Court, had led the bench that trounced the proclamation of the then president of India to resurrect the Congress state government. The Union of India did not like it and possibly not forgotten it. Reports suggest that citing breach of \"seniority\" the  recommendations sent by the Supreme Court collegium to appoint Uttarakhand High Court chief justice, KM Joseph, as a judge of the apex court, and justice Surya Kant of Punjab and Haryana High Court as chief justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court. Tagging on the candidature of   appears to be a ruse to justify the reluctance of the government to accommodate justice Joseph. Reasons are not far to seek and it would not go down well with those who see the need for institutional integrity in ensuring  independent voices as occupants  on the apex court bench. For the healthy functioning of democracy, there ought to be harmony between the three pillars - the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. While no one institution can be seen to be kowtowing to the other, respect and regard for the role of the other is necessary. Yes, the executive and the legislature are cut up over judicial transgressions into the territory of the other. There are undeniable instances of judicial overreaching seemingly belittling the roles of the other two pillars. But, to the informed, it would appear that it is the failure of the executive and the legislative branches to satisfactorily perform their roles that has led to the inexorable reality of the judiciary being \"constrained\" to fill in the breach.   Yes, the executive and the legislature may be peeved at the usurped right to appoint judges to constitutional courts to the collegium. It was an innovation conceived, introduced and being implemented by the apex court which was not even contemplated by the makers of the Constitution. It was veritable judicial legislation unheard of in the annals of any democratic jurisprudence. But it became  a \"necessary compulsion\" as the executive was seen to be overreaching its domain and not laying store by meaningful \"consultative\" process with the judiciary represented by the chief justice of India.  Judicial appointments were getting \"too political\" in \"committed candidates\" for the nation’s comfort that the Supreme Court in the Second Judges Case in 1993 chose to take charge. Ever since, the other two pillars have been trying to get even with the judiciary. Despite the cleavage in political opinions, the legislators got together, across the aisle to move a constitutional amendment and a legislation in the National Judicial Appointments Commission. Both Houses of Parliament passed the statute unanimously except for the sole dissent of Ram Jethmalani in the Rajya Sabha, toeing his own line. The requisite number of state Assemblies also fell in line and the NJAC became a reality, only to be challenged before the Supreme Court by the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association. From day one of the proceedings, it was evident from what fell from the bench that the NJAC may not pass constitutional muster. The presence of the law minister in the decision-making body of the commission was held to be the \"red rag\" indicative and conclusive of political interference into the sanctified territory of \"independent judiciary\". The rest of the challenge paled into insignificance, and despite the original expectation that the NJAC may after all sail through, since an otherwise divided polity had got together as one, after over two decades of repeated attempts, possibly with a \"reading down\" of the provision relating to the presence of the law minister and \"eminent person\" and making the elective body with an odd number, giving primacy to the vote of the chief justice of India. Alas, it was not be. A 4-1 verdict with justice J Chelameswar alone in dissent meant the NJAC was confined to the dustbin of constitutional history. The executive and the legislature appear to have been side-lined by the judiciary in a unique case of \"judges anointing themselves\" in a precedent of rarity. Arun Jaitley christened that as \"unelected tyranny\". Latching on to the fig leaf on offer to put in place a consensual memorandum of procedure (MoP), the central government seems to be asserting the role of the executive. The MoP has been doing the rounds between the collegium and government, and the final version of March 2017 is lying unresponded to by the executive. Incidentally, this issue was also flagged of by four of the senior-most judges when they went public on the roster control of the chief justice of India. By convention, when the collegium reiterates its view, when sent back by the executive, it shall prevail. This is akin to the constitutional position when the cabinet seeks the nod of the president of India, and the president returns the matter for the cabinet to reconsider. If the cabinet sticks to its recommendation, the president shall have to fall in line (Article 74 (1) of Constitution). It was a healthy convention, which the collegium recommendations also assumed, with the top court imprimatur. It may do a world of good to the Modi dispensation to yield to the collegium recommendation for justice Joseph, whose credentials are otherwise with not a speck of doubt. In citing seniority as the basis for blocking, the executive appears to be inventing excuses for its political decision. Not a healthy precedent to set, for sure.","title":"Why Centre blocking nomination of two judges to SC collegium sets a bad precedent","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-centre-tussle-blocks-nomination-judges-sc-collegium-modi-government/story/1/22640.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15252},{"author":"Amit Sengupta","content":"For those who were closely watching the border state of Tripura in the Northeast, despite the impeccable credentials of a rare chief minister like  , the Assembly results seemed like a foregone conclusion. Indeed, even die-hard optimists gave the CPM a thin margin, perhaps, a neck-and-neck chance, considering the organised rise of the BJP and the RSS in Tripura, with full money power, hyperbolic promises and loaded with central resources. Plus, there was the inter-play of complex factors that underlined the politics and social demography of this tiny \"peaceful state\" in close proximity with Bangladesh. Peaceful - for more reasons than one. For four decades and more, the CPM ruled the state, and for many, it was the sober and simple personality of Manik Sarkar which shined in the green landscape. Sarkar gave away his entire salary to the party, lived on Rs 2,000 plus per month given by the party, with a tiffin of puffed rice, apparently his favourite, had a bank balance of less than Rs 2,000, just a fraction of a little land on the outskirts of capital Agartala shared with his sister, no car, no property, no email account, not even a mobile. He was certainly a stoic, classical communist, and Tripura seemed proud of him, even while the party bosses in Delhi, Kerala and Kolkata, never really thought it important to showcase him in the national stage. His wife, Panchali Bhattacharya, a retired government official, travelled on rickshaw and public transport, and was as stoic and classical a communist as her husband. There are other reasons as well, as to why it took so long for anti-incumbency and the rise of Hindutva to outsmart Sarkar’s regime. He effectively restored peace and communal harmony in a state infested with violent insurgency and cross-border terrorism and strife. He was the first to abolish the draconian   (AFSPA), unite the Bengalis and the tribals, stop the forces of separatism (now aligned with the BJP), clean up the system, raise literacy to almost 90 per cent, eliminate poverty and malnutrition in large areas, push for women’s empowerment as a policy on the ground, restore law and order, give tribals their traditional rights. He also blocked hate politics which seemed to have stalked other parts of the country, especially the Hindi heartland, since the arrival of the BJP’s majority regime in Delhi since 2014. Literacy and unemployment, though, went hand-in-hand, due to lack of infrastructure, investment and industry; but, Sarkar would nonchalantly respond that this has been a national phenomena since the new regime in Delhi has failed in all its promises, and a direct fallout of demonetisation as well. So why blame only tiny Tripura? However, to come face to face with the bitter realism of the contemporary scenario, the BJP has risen for the following complex electoral and social factors: Ruling for 25 years with impeccable honesty is just not enough for the modern electorate, especially the aspiring educated classes, high on the flip-side of globalisation and liberalisation, and low on history, philosophy or social sciences. The downward filter theory has not really worked in India, but it is still an eternally seductive and addictive lollypop - hanging like \"lucy in the sky with diamonds\". Anti-incumbency is the primary reason for the loss of Sarkar’s  government, even  while the Opposition, namely the Congress and a section of the Trinamool Congress have been decimated, coopted, sidelined, subverted or bought over, most of it willfully, with the Congress high command in Delhi, head safely in the sand, refusing to see the writing on the wall. The Congress in-charge of Tripura, CP Joshi, reportedly, visited it only once, while   displayed little interest. Most elected representatives of these parties went over to the BJP, so that many seem to have only voted for the old Congress in a new saffron avatar. The tribal-Bengali conflict has been simmering for decades, and it goes to the credit of Sarkar, who reconciled the difficult layers of inherited differences. While a large chunk of Bengali voters have been aligned with the Congress, the tribals, with their indigenous rights ushered in by the Left regime, chose to go with the CPM. The separatist and militant Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPTF), which got zero votes in the last Assembly polls in 2013, has won eight out the nine it contested, thereby clearly implying that the tribal vote base along with a large chunk of the Bengali vote base has shifted away from the Left to the separatists and the BJP. Almost the entire Congress voter base has gone over to the BJP. According to unconfirmed reports, the CPM has scored around 47 per cent votes, still the largest share. The BJP, with 42 per cent and the IPTF, with 8 per cent, has scored a combined tally of 50 per cent. Indeed, for the BJP, it is still a risky proposition, combining the Bengali vote base with the militant tribal separatism. This can crack anytime, or create sharp fissures. Time will tell how it will play its dangerous Hindutva card in this edgy scenario in a strategically located state. What is significant in Tripura, as in West Bengal, is that there is an eternal and incipient communal current in the mainstream Bengali population. How the Congress in the past, in the  absence of Hindutva forces, was able to use this current, and yet failed to topple a stagnating CPM, remains a mystery. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee has outclassed the Left by appropriating all the inherited intellectual symbols of the Bengali heritage: from Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, to Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Vivekananda, Rani Rashmoni, you name it. Even Satyajit Ray and megastar Uttam Kumar’s photogenic memories, along with the other legends, are carved all across Kolkata, adorned with Mamata’s picture - making her the proud inheritor of a great legacy. Red flags or Left wall graffiti seem to have vanished in Kolkata, where local clubs, once CPM bastions, have been taken over by Trinamool, while rural Bengal, where the CPM did land reforms and entrenched its extra-constitutional, often, lumpen base, has opportunistically shifted to the  ruling regime. The BJP, despite coming second in some bypolls in Bengal, can’t even plant its flag in large parts of rural Bengal. Indeed, observers believe that the Tripura result might polarise the communal dimension among certain sections of sectarian Bengalis, especially in the middle class, and in border areas. The chanting of \"Jai Sri Ram\", communal polarisation, and the rise of Hindutva was marked since 2014 in Tripura when the RSS took over the shakhas and injected new dynamism to its politics in the border - with the eternal phobia of the Bangladeshi Muslim factor being played to the hilt.   Sarkar’s popularity or honesty, however, could not hide occasional cases of corruption, faulty implementation of grassroots programmes, the weakening of the Left’s organisational structure, and some of the Left leaders choosing not to be so die-hard honest as their chief minister. Finally, Sarkar has to pay the price. The irony is that when Prakash Karat became general secretary of the CPM, he declared that they will enter the Hindi heartland. From UPA 1 in 2004, the 60 united Left numbers in the Lok Sabha have been reduced to about 10 in the current Lok Sabha. The CPM has been finished in Bengal, defeated decisively in Tripura. While the   line plays out in full glare, the fall and fall of the Left in contemporary India is as transparent as the old Marxist prophecy: history repeats itself, first as a farce, then, as tragedy, and a nightmare.","title":"Why Manik Sarkar failed to stop BJP's win in Tripura Assembly elections","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-assembly-election-results-manik-sarkar-cpm-bjp-rss-hindutva-bengalis-congress/story/1/22642.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15253},{"author":"Nikhil Wagle","content":"In September 1995, a bizarre news story made headlines. The idol of lord Ganesha was apparently drinking milk, and the entire country was talking about it. The media had particularly gone berserk. While most journalists sought comments from politicians or scientists, Surendra Pratap Singh, who used to edit and anchor “Aaj Tak” - a news bulletin on Doordarshan that later culminated into a news channel - sent his reporter to a cobbler. He simplified the capillary action and explained it beautifully to the viewers. As I watched, or rather read about, the crass media coverage of  death, I missed my friend SP Singh, more than ever. Unfortunately, SP passed away prematurely. News channels, including the one he founded, would have been better off with his perspective that was so palpably missing. Because that's the purpose an editor is supposed to serve - to put developments in perspective, irrespective of the TRPs. In the quest to “break news”, channels did not follow any of the basic rules of cross-verification. And what followed after that was sheer black comedy. Deep discussions ranging from whether an excellent dancer could fall in a bathtub to whether India has a “bathtub culture” with images of drowning Sridevi with Boney Kapoor watching along to enhance our experience. A South Indian reporter went a step further and literally entered a bathtub, leaving behind all the English and Hindi channels. Amid the madness, how could BJP MP Subramanian Swamy keep mum? He demanded an inquiry between Dawood Ibrahim and the Hindi film industry, suggesting foul play. Like a postman, ANI passed it on to news channels without countering him, and the news channels carried it. I am neither shocked nor surprised. Private news channels have been on the rise since 2000. And incidents like Sridevi's would be found in abundance if we peep into the recent history of these channels. Take the example of little   who fell into a well, or even the   case. A few weeks back when the news media was consumed with  , some of the reporters had donned Padmavati's costume to present news. Why should this be called \"journalism\" is a million-dollar question. When commentators or media critics point out the nonsense disguised as journalism, an easy excuse of TRP is thrown back at the critics. While the viewers, to whom I will come later in the piece, are responsible for abetting the sorry state of journalism, the primary responsibility lies with the editors. Journalism cannot always be viewer-driven. There is no denying the viewership generates revenues and is essential for the sustenance of channels, but not at the cost of journalistic integrity. If the owners insist on TRP-driven programmes, shouldn't the editors stand up to them? Why cannot they have faith in themselves to engage the viewers with good content? I headed a news channel for seven years, which was watched and embraced by the state of Maharashtra. Not once the management knocked on my doors to pressurise me for TRP-driven programmes because we provided content. I sent my reporters to the field, instead of bathtubs. Editors today have become lazy. They do not want to work hard for numbers. But in the conquest of cheap success, they have sacrificed good journalism. They have reduced journalism to a platform for cheap entertainment. The most unfortunate part is it is not happening out of lack of skill, but lack of conscience. When you head a TV channel, you have a certain responsibility towards the society. And when people in positions of power start selling their souls, it seeps into the society as well. Indian journalism has rich history right from the time of   inspired Raja Ram Mohan Roy. The legacy continued through the freedom struggle and thereafter as well. But in the last decades or so, the entire legacy has been shredded into pieces. There is nothing wrong in aspiring to be the most-viewed channel. But as I said earlier, it cannot be achieved through shortcuts. Simply echoing the “public sentiment” is not journalism. And the guests participating in it, validate and legitimise the circus. Which brings me to the viewers, who are as culpable here. I was in Mumbai and Nasik the day after Sridevi passed away. Not a single household I stepped into had anything other than Sridevi on their TVs. The channels discussing it insensitively and the viewers watching it with equal voyeurism. It is a fact that the channels feasting on Sridevi's death are the ones that are most watched. Viewers enable editors to be mediocre, and vice versa. We have been caught in a vicious circle. The question is, how long will this blame game continue? Will the viewers stop watching these channels? Will the editors think of journalism first and TRPs later? The need to look inwards is starker than ever, because it wasn’t just Sridevi's funeral that took place on Wednesday. Journalist Barkha Dutt aptly came up with the hashtag “ ”. And all of us provided a shoulder to it.","title":"Who is responsible for 'news ki maut'?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sridevi-death-media-coverage-voyeurism-bollywood-tv-news-channels-trp/story/1/22644.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15254},{"author":"David Frawley","content":"In retrospect, the biggest political news of 2017 in India was the landslide BJP win in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous in India, followed by Yogi Adityanath taking over as the new chief minister. The magnitude of this victory was unexpected and sent shockwaves throughout the country, compounded by the fact that a saffron monk was chosen to lead the state. The Congress could not even hold on to the Gandhi  . The UP event was augmented by the BJP to Bihar alliance government, as Nitish Kumar abandoned Lalu Prasad's RJD that was steering the state back towards crime and corruption. The recent additional convictions of Lalu and the investigations into his family show the wisdom of this move by Nitish. The result is that the main Hindu heartland of UP and Bihar is now under BJP or saffron rule and a unitary Hindu vote is emerging in areas in which  had previously prevailed. This Hindu vote, however, is not a mere religious assertion or promotion of religious intolerance, as some would say, but an awakening of Indians to their cultural unity and ancient heritage. The so-called Hindu nationalism is not a regressive tendency, but an aspirational move to a new India much as PM Narendra Modi has noted, which honours the great dharmic civilisation of the region and aims at sustaining its continuity. This is different from the Nehruvian India that was more an imitation of failed Western socialist states than anything Indian or dharmic. The UP poll marked the removal of the Nehruvian shadow from the centre of the country. The more recent Gujarat election has been emphasised as a Congress revival, mainly because the BJP did not win through a landslide margin, not because Congress actually won. That losing an election less badly is promoted as positive news for the Congress only shows how far the party has fallen from power. The fact is at the end of the year, the BJP is governing a great majority of states in India and Congress-ruled states are a mere footnote. The Gujarat election was conducted in the shadow of the UP election. Rahul Gandhi ran as the newly appointed (one cannot accurately say elected) Congress president. Though Rahul had not previously showed any interest in Hindu temples, much less overtly supporting any Hindu causes - he went on an extensive political temple tour, visiting more than 20 temples in Gujarat. More notably, he suddenly called himself a thread wearing Brahmin Hindu, strange for one who was long happy to live quietly in the shadow of a Christian mother as if he were a Christian himself. No other leader in the Nehru/Gandhi dynasty has ever made such a clear statement of Hindu identity, not even Indira Gandhi who regularly visited Hindu gurus. Yet, it is not devotion to Hinduism but political necessity that seems to have motivated his statement. The Congress has not given up its old anti-Hindu policies in this overt change to a  . It continues its old policy of dividing Hindus through caste with new vigour. The Congress attempted this in Gujarat as well. Similarly, Congress leaders in Karnataka are trying to divide Hindus on the basis of religious practices, supporting Veera Shaivites as non-Hindus. Meanwhile, Rahul and Congress continue stoking leftist sentiments, allying themselves with communist parties and student unions like those of Jawaharlal Nehru University. Rahul only displays his Hindu appearance when required. Otherwise he is happy to be part of the far-left and support anti-Hindu agendas, particularly hatred for Brahmins. Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal is now following the same strategy. Can such old strident anti-Hindu leaders draw enough of the Hindu vote in order to stay in power, without changing their anti-Hindu policies? That is the question. Can they get the voters to forget their charges of saffron terrorism and their excusing of jihadi activities? Over these issues looms the shadow of UP and with it the issue of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. So far, the Congress has not changed its stand on the   and Rahul has not made any statements on whether the party is still opposed to building the temple and laments the loss of Babri Masjid. The problem for the Congress is that its leaders have long provided legal support for those against the temple, and long castigated Hindus who support the Ram Mandir as communal, anti-secular, if not fascist. On Ayodhya, the party continues to follow anti-Hindu policies of the communists and leftists. A reversal on this issue would be difficult to explain, yet without it any Hindu support for the Congress remains doubtful. Meanwhile, PM Modi remains committed to promoting Indian interests globally and expanding development inside the country as well. The main problem he has to face is that the entrenched Congress ecosystem in the Rajya Sabha, courts and bureaucracy continue to resist change and improvement, particularly now that their graft and black money sources have been cut off. The Congress is promoting a hate Modi campaign, and trying to create as much confusion and mayhem as it can in society. Apart from its few pro-Hindu gestures, the Congress is now looking more like a new version of the Aam Aadmi Party with Rahul Gandhi as the new Arvind Kejriwal, promoting anarchy in the name of resisting oppression. The stature of Modi continues to tower over such immature attempts at political disruption and will likely dominate the future. But expect a year of political theatre, shifting and contradictory views, with anti-Modi stunts and antics covering over a lack of policy or leadership by the Opposition. The Hindu card will be used to capitalise on all sorts of social divisions and consistent attempts to create confusion and disruptions will be made. Yet it is likely that the \"new Congress\" will meet the same fate as the AAP.

She was apparently feeling suffocated and frustrated with the Yameen government particularly since her father, Maumoon Gayoom, a former president who ruled Maldives for over three decades, was arrested recently on orders of his half-brother President Abdulla Yameen on criminal charges.   \r\n \r\n Though  has said in her resignation letter that she hasn't joined the Opposition, the development is bound to bolster the Opposition which has been at its wits’ end in dealing with the increasingly autocratic President Abdulla Yameen. Despite her caveat of not joining the Opposition, she has expressed concern about the state of democracy, judiciary and institutions and called upon the international community to help getting all these back on rails. \r\n \r\n This has been the consistent demand of the Maldivian Opposition for quite some time. Obviously, it means that the Opposition has got a shot in the arm and Dunya is firmly in the Opposition camp despite her feeble caveats to the contrary. Dunya Maumoon’s resignation came hours after it surfaced that India had offered to Maldives to participate in the  , to be held in Port Blair early next month, but the Maldives government declined the offer - a clear snub to India by Maldives ostensibly at the behest of China. Although Maldivian authorities have \"explained\" to India that under the current circumstances when the island nation has been under a state of emergency, it wasn't possible for Maldives to participate in the naval exercises as the Maldivian defence forces were on a standby to deal with any exigency. The Maldivian government’s rejection of the Indian offer to join the Milan exercises is being looked upon in the Indian strategic establishment as the Yameen government’s latest snub to India. It has been quite clear in the past few months that Maldives has flown out of the Indian orbit and flown into the Chinese sphere instead. It was demonstrated a few months ago when Maldives had signed its first-ever FTA with China, leaving India high and dry despite the Yameen government’s repeated assurances to New Delhi about its India-first policy. Maldives’ rapid drifting away from India and its China embrace came into sharp focus once again after news reports emerged in the Indian media that China was at the cusp of getting a military base in Maldives by way of Beijing establishing a joint ocean observation station in Maldives’ Makunudhoo, which is not very far from India. India, though seething with anger over the recent developments in Maldives, cannot do much to reverse the tide under the current circumstances. An Indian military intervention, sought by Opposition leader and former Maldivian president Mohammed Nasheed, is out of question. It's not just because of Chinese warnings, but essentially because of well-established principles of Indian foreign policy of not intervening in domestic affairs of a foreign power unless a specific request is made by the government of the troubled country. Moreover, since the nightmarish experience of Indian intervention in Sri Lanka when the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi sent Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka, it has been the unwritten principle of India not to embark on military missions abroad. Under the circumstances, the only doable option before India is to work through the United Nations route. In this context, the following initiative of an international body bells with the Indian scheme of things.  , the law association for Asia and the Pacific comprising of national bar associations and law societies in the United Nations ESCAP Region, has just decided to establish a fact-finding team for the purpose of ascertaining the situation with regard to: 1) The independence of the judiciary in Maldives 2) The independence of the Judicial Services Commission, and the transparency of  the process for appointment of judges and investigations of complaints regarding judicial conduct 3) The independence of the legal profession, and whether members of the legal profession are able to perform their professional duties unhindered and free of harassment or intimidation 4) Due process in the administration of justice in the Republic of Maldives 5) The rule of law and rights-related issues. The LAWASIA fact-finding team, led by its president Christopher Leong, is an independent team with an objective mission which is not to be sponsored by any parties, organisations or individuals from Maldives. This initiative is in response to the Maldivian foreign ministry's February 7 statement which said: “Maldives would like to invite its development partners and representatives from international organisations and associations to visit Maldives to assess the situation and witness the safety and security of Male, for their own citizens as well as to engage with the Government and key stakeholders in the country.” India will be backing the LAWASIA Initiative to the hilt, knowing full well that initiatives like these can bring more fruits quickly than the efforts of the marginalised Opposition.","title":"Why deepening Maldives crisis should worry India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/maldives-india-snub-milan-naval-exercises-abdulla-yameen-gayoom-dunya-maumoon/story/1/22604.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15256},{"author":"Praveen Shekhar","content":"A meeting of the  that was held in Paris concluded on February 23. During a plenary session of the FATF meet it was decided that Pakistan should be put on the \"grey list\" again to keep a watch on the rogue nation for not complying with the norms to check financing of terrorism. Over the next four months, Pakistan is expected to comply with certain stipulated conditions failing which it will find mention in FATF's formal statement. The neighbouring country was on the watch-list between 2012 and 2015 but only for money laundering. This time, however, Pakistan will be monitored for its compliance with anti-money laundering and Combating Finance of Terrorism regulations. FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989. Its objectives are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering,   and other threats to the international financial system. The Unites States worked behind the scenes during the Paris meet to ensure action against Islamabad, which Washington believes has not kept its promises on combating terrorism. All 39 member countries of FATF, barring Turkey, supported the US proposal against Pakistan. Even Pakistan's allies - China and Saudi Arabia - withdrew their objection to the move for punitive action. \r\n \r\n The decision at FATF has sent out an encouraging signal. The message that had gone out it that even if some countries do not see eye to eye on certain issues, combating terrorism was a common cause. This is the first time that China has supported India's stand and not backed Pakistan at a global anti-terror forum, thus landing a crippling blow to Islamabad's financial credentials. India is high on hope after China isolated Pakistan on the issue of terrorism. However, India does not need to be over ecstatic about the development. The reason is simple. China's stand at the FATF meet was backed by its own considerations. Remember, China is itself a victim of terrorism in the Xinjiang province. Today, if China doesn't join the global fight against terror, it may find itself isolated in tackling the menace on its own territory in the future. Also, China's brotherly love for Pakistan hasn't waned. The signs of this love are not just reflected in the Chinese investments in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the One Belt One Road Initiative. It goes much beyond that. Being on the grey list would mean that Pakistan's transactions are closely monitored. This would further cripple the country's economy as companies across the world would hesitate from doing business with Pakistan. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank too would avoid giving loans to Pakistan. In January, US President Donald Trump publicly raised concerns over Pakistan's reliability and integrity. His first tweet of 2018 put Islamabad in the cross hairs for its \"lies and deceit\".

Today, science has proved that intrauterine baby cannot only listen, touch, feel but also can respond on its own. More than 60 per cent intellectual development occurs in intrauterine phase. Garbhasanskar - are special scientific procedures performed to stimulate baby’s senses genteelly, because during intrauterine phase, cortical development is maximum. Health, body built, Intellect, talent all depends upon mother’s prenatal care. Mind, body and intelligence are synchronised and these have special value in life.” This reasonable scientific elucidation soon segues into the area of pseudoscience which the RSS is notorious for. (And out goes the grammar too as it warms to its theme.) “You can invite divine souls to take birth as transition phase is going on. Spiritually during this time, all the divine souls are keen to take birth. Divine souls come with good learning to perform good acts in this world. Hence, are constantly looking for the right parents, perfect environment where they are groomed in such a manner so that they can continue with their noble work which may be purpose of re-birth.” Therefore, the couple has to increase the good karmic level to such an extent that the divine soul chooses it to be its parents. Since all this is possible only during the pregnancy phase which we strongly believe is one of the most important, precious and delicate phase in the lifetime of any mother. People who follow our most advanced garbh sanskar antenatal classes sincerely get desirable results.” Among others, the Jamnagar-based centre has what they describe as “medical astrologers, yoga and music experts” in their team of consultants. Says the kendra’s manager, Rekha Gaur. “Every parent wants to have a good quality baby. Parents want their child to be bright and smart. But how can that be achieved? The answer lies in our sanskriti (culture) and values… If the parents want their child to be like Shivaji Maharaj, Rana Pratap or Aryabhata, then they will be provided with necessary suggestions. There is a whole range of sanskar prakriya (ritualistic procedure). There are different procedures if someone wishes to have a fair and tall baby or a smart and intelligent baby.” The RSS' love for a race which is of “fair” complexion is part of its ideological heritage that Indians are Aryans; fair, tall, honourable, respectable and noble who speak Sanskrit. RSS stands for Aryan supremacy and believes that only Hindu Brahmins of north India are from that stock. The most prominent ideologue of RSS, Guru Golwalkar, while addressing a gathering of faculty and students of the School of Social Science of Gujarat University on December 17, 1960, shared the wisdom that Namboodri Brahmins from north India were sent to Kerala to improve breed of Hindus there. According to him: “Today experiments in cross-breeding are made only on animals. But the courage to make such experiments on human beings is not shown even by the so-called modern scientists of today. If some human crossbreeding is seen today it is the result not of scientific experiments but of carnal lust. Now, let us see the experiments our ancestors made in this sphere. In an effort to better the human species through cross-breeding the Namboodri Brahamanas of the north were settled in Kerala and a rule was laid down that the eldest son of a Namboodri family could marry only the daughter of Vaishya, Kashtriya or Shudra communities of Kerala. Another still more courageous rule was that the first off-spring of a married woman of any class must be fathered by a Namboodri Brahman and then she could beget children by her husband.” The RSS' belief of Aryan superiority has been borrowed from Hitler and his Nazi Party of Germany. Adolf Hitler even before becoming chancellor of Germany was obsessed with ideas about race. He believed in racial “purity” and in the superiority of the “Germanic race” which he described as Aryan “master race.” He declared this Aryan race must remain pure in order to rule the world one day which was not far away. According to Hitler, the ideal “Aryan” was blond, blue-eyed, and tall. According to Dr Hitesh Jani, convenor of Arogya Bharati, another offshoot of RSS which is part of the project, “If the proper procedure is followed, babies of dark-skinned parents with lesser height can have fair complexion and grow taller”. When Golwalkar’s fascination with Hitler came up  for discussion in the Rajya Sabha on May 6, 2002,  the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee dismissed Golwalkar's openly fascist views as \"his own ( )'' and added that the BJP had \"nothing to do with the book (   )'' and that his party \"had never given its stamp of approval  nahin lagayi)\", which was, of course, as untruthful as the undertaking of the RSS to Sardar Patel that it would remain a \"social organisation\". Yet Golwalkar’s “apne vichar” keeps coming back like a bad penny, and this time around with government collusion. The next counselling sessions to create Übermensch Hindus like the Nazi Lebensborn project, are slated to be held in Kolkata, Rohtak and Gurgaon. The RSS has set a target by 2020 to have thousands of ideal infants on the production line. So, what are these ancient and venerable texts that will have little Rana Prataps and Shivajis gamboling around our Elysian fields of the future? Here’s an example from the Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad in its fourth section which describes the Putramanthanamantra rites by which a house-holder can get a worthy son or a worthy daughter. ( verse 6-4-17) If the husband and wife wish that a daughter should be born and that she should be learned and live full term of life, they should prepare rice cooked in sesame and they should eat with clarified butter. Then they will fulfil their desire.\" Here’s a passage from the Ayurvedic astrological conception chart calculation: “The lagna of the conception chart is the seventh from the child’s janma lagna. That which was the seventh house of the conception chart becomes the lagna [or navamsha lagna] of the individual. There is a great revelation hidden in this technique. The seventh house of the conception chart shows the mental and emotional qualities between the parents at the moment of creating the individual. This seventh house sign then becomes the rashi or navamsha lagna of the individual’s birth chart. In this way, the guna (levels of rajas and tamas) and doshas (levels of the elements) of the parents dominant at the time of conception influences the nature of the child as stated in the Ayurveda texts.” There’s a lot more which will make any 21  century educated person’s toes curl in embarrassment. But the irony of the passage recommending the ideal conditions in which to conceive the sonnenkinder boy child is unmistakable, given the zealous Hindutva drive against non-vegetarian, and specifically beef.   (verse 6-4-18) Those who aspire for a son should be born to them, who should be a reputed scholar, who should be frequenting the assemblies of learned scholars, who would be speaking delightful and valuable words, who will be a master of all the Vedas and who will live a long life, then both husband and wife should eat with clarified butter meat of a young bull or of a bull advanced in years. Then they will succeed in their ambition.\"","title":"Why RSS has intensified its drive to create babies with 'Aryabhata's brain' and 'Shivaji Maharaj’s build'","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rss-garbhvigyan-anusandhan-kendra-seminar-kit-10-cds-arogya-bharati-hindutva-nazism/story/1/22529.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15258},{"author":"Kamal Mitra Chenoy","content":"Ever since 2013, the   (AAP) has been, as far as the political class is concerned, the new kid on the block. Its initial success in 2013 was seen as a voters' lapse, a bad judgement of the electorate which should have chosen the more experienced and settled political parties like the Congress and the BJP. This triangular contest has continued since then. The   just can’t accept the AAP style of politics. The systematic building of mohalla clinics, linking these clinics to hospitals, the revamping of government schools, a host of measures for the poor, including free and cheap potable water, subsidised electricity, more systematic mosquito eradication, anti-drug campaigns and a host of other measures. The mainstream parties despite their longevity failed to seize the potential of these and other measures. They and the Delhi administration took the opportunity of AAP not having a stable majority in the Delhi Assembly to postpone the Assembly elections towards the end of 2015. Despite this gambit, the AAP came to power with 67 Assembly seats out of 70 - with the BJP getting only three seats and the Congress none. This, the Opposition found horrible. Triangular politics became even more vicious and outlandish. The established political class’s dictum became \"when in doubt attack the AAP\". This vitriol was poured against the AAP because in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 in Varanasi, where Narendra Modi was the candidate, the AAP came second and the Congress a poor third. The AAP had become a threat to the political establishment. After this, the anti-AAP campaign became a torrent of abuse, slander, administrative intervention and even extra-judicial attacks on the AAP. Arvind Kejriwal was pilloried for staging a dharna near the Republic Day parade. Didn’t Mahatma Gandhi stop the collection of precious salt at the end of the Dandi March? Didn’t he intervene, or near, into a host of events in South Africa and India? Did anyone, excluding the Sangh Parivar, claim that what he was doing was anti-national? And did Kejriwal actually disrupt Republic Day celebrations? Clearly, Kejriwal’s stated intention was to demonstrate without disruption. But the mass of the media never forgave him. It is instructive to remember that, unlike the Press Council, the electronic media is virtually uncontrolled, or to put it differently, carefully primed to attack forces inimical to the interests of the media channels and their owners. In the past few days, on an “attack” channel, I heard the participants, including the anchor, referring to Kejriwal as a “Maovadi” and a \"Talibani\". My objections were heeded in the first case, but ignored in the second. Tragically, the media believes that anything goes, if it suits the interests of the channel, its owners and supporters. Thus, the term “fake” news. The role of the police cannot be understated. After the confusion and altercation with the  , the Delhi Police searched Kejriwal’s residence. Could it have done so in the case of a Union minister? The CM is the head of the Delhi government. Unfortunately, this has become commonplace. For example, after a political debate in JNU in February 2016, three students, including Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya were arrested and accused of treason. The courts threw the case out. But even after two years, the chargesheet against these students has not been submitted. Or when months later, Kanhaiya was beaten up by lawyers in the presence of the police, police commissioner BS Bassi denied any violence. But the doctors of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital found injuries on Kanhaiya’s body. This is what politicians have done to the police - the politicisation of the police, generally at the behest of politicians and powerful interests. The several police actions against the AAP and idealistic students and youth, obviously goes against the grain of the ideals of the freedom struggle, and the Constitution. This is what the major political parties and vested interests have come to. Will matters improve when passions cool? Highly likely. The mixture of political partisanship, an attack-media, a hostile Union government, an administration under pressure, are not matters and influences that can just wither away. But it should be remembered that administrators also work under difficult circumstances. Kejriwal will remember how a senior IAS officer advising him was picked up by the Delhi Police. Different actions for different people. The AAP has a tough ask. But he and the AAP have faced many challenges. They are here to stay, backed by a huge mass of supporters.","title":"Why India's political elite can't accept AAP's grassroots politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-arvind-kejriwal-maovadi-delhi-chief-secretary-anshu-prakash-bjp-congress-police/story/1/22527.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15259},{"author":"Seema Guha","content":"China and India the two major Asian powers have a complex relationship.   has already arrived on the world stage as a major economic and military power bent on reshaping the world its way. India is equally ambitious but as a chaotic democracy, it has not matched China's economic or military might. India knows that as a big populous nation it too has the potential to be a future global power. What is more, the US, concerned about Chinese dominance is willing to help India's growth to balance the regions power equation. The strategy to balance China by giving India a leg-up began during the George W Bush administration and is now being rigorously backed by President Donald Trump. However unlike India, Chinese planning is long-term. Beijing thinks through and meticulously plans its goals. Before embarking on its ambitious foreign policy goals, Deng Xiaoping the great reformer concentrated on the economy. China also settled all its boundary disputes with its neighbours, with the notable exception of India. Deng famously advised his people, to keep their heads down and work towards lifting the living standards of the Chinese. Having done that, China is now ready to take on the world under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, one of China's most powerful leaders. The nineteenth Congress of the CPC (Communist Party of China) was a coming out party for Xi Jinping's China. It is now the second-largest economy in the world. It is also a military power with a blue water navy. It is spending billions on research concentrating on artificial intelligence, gearing the nation to be at the forefront of cutting edge technology. Chinese submarines and ships are present both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. President Xi Jinping is consolidating and building on Deng Xiaoping's vision of opening up China to the world. While it is expanding its presence across Asia and Africa, (it also has a military base in Djibouti, east Africa), China is looking at being the number one power in the world. It is still far from closing the gap with the US, and knows on its way to become a super power it needs to first dominate Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. So the hectic activity in the South China Sea and expansion into the Indian Ocean sphere. China is also now playing hardball in India's immediate neighbourhood. Xi's ambitious belt and road and maritime initiatives is part of a larger plan to spread its influence across the globe. It is but natural that India and China, the two Asian neighbours eye each other's development warily and \"circle\" each other's periphery. The unresolved border problem between India and China, and PLA's frequent incursions, including the recent   as well as its heavy presence in India's immediate neighbourhood has added to the fear of China pushing into India's sphere of influence. India too has been stepping up its ties with Japan as well as all ASEAN countries. In fact, this Republic Day leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations - Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Philippines, Laos and Cambodia accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to be in Delhi to celebrate not just India's Republic Day but also to mark 25-years of India-ASEAN dialogue partnership. The ASEAN group, which has thriving trade with China, is still wary of Beijing and wants India to play a greater role in the region. ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei also have problems with China's claim to the entire South China Sea and the islands dotted across the waters as its own. But China's footprints are much larger in India's backyard. In the past, Pakistan was the only South Asian nation which had close ties with China. But now China has won not just a toe-hold but a foothold in several countries in India's neighbourhood. Pakistan is now a central piece of China's belt and road project. Beijing is investing $60 billion in developing infrastructure around Gwadar, a port China built in Pakistan's Balochistan province. China has already begun using Gwadar for its exports and is likely to deploy a contingent of the PLA to guard its interests there. In Nepal too, China is becoming a pivotal force. Like all small nations, India's neighbours have often used the China card against India. Nepal's new  , known to be close to China,   after the elections: \"We have great connectivity with India and an open border.., but we can't forget that we have two neighbours. We don't want to depend on one country or have one option.\" He explained that Nepal needed this to get leverage in dealing with India. India's foolish decision in 2015 of an unofficial blockade in Nepal, following a Madhesi agitation, soured ties between the two countries. While a pro-India government with Oli at the head is in power in Kathmandu, a China friendly leader is also in place in the Maldives. In Male, President Abdulla Yameen has cracked down on democracy, thrown opposition leaders in jail, and declared an emergency. While India, The US, the UK Britain and the rest of the world have condemned Yameen, China has lent support. It has also warned India against interference in the neighbour's politics. Maldives has signed a Free Trade Agreement in December 2017 with China and has invested hugely in building infrastructure. Chinese vessels regularly stop in the Maldives raising fears of a strong naval presence there. Whether in Sri Lanka, or Myanmar or even Bangladesh, China is present all along India's neighbourhood and beyond. Border talks between Bhutan and China, long in cold storage will begin now, perhaps with Doklam in mind. China is slush with funds and India cannot match its efficient infrastructure building. Delhi should concentrate on its strengths, which is institution building. Repeating its good work in Afghanistan, it should go for smaller projects which can make a difference on the ground and directly help people. The rewards in Afghanistan have been rich. It has continued in training officials. Both Japan and the US have come forward to work with India on building connectivity both in Asia and Africa. All this is good politics. The fact that India's ties with the US are thriving is being watched with some concern in China. The need of the hour is to keep working in the neighbourhood, which has both cultural affinities with democratic India as well as excellent people to people contact. India and China will not go to war, the stakes are heavily loaded against a repeat of 1962. There is little reason to panic, but it is important to work on India's strengths. India should deepen its engagement with Pakistan instead of resorting to foolish measures such as   from across the border from working in India. This does not reflect the real Indian culture. Reaching out to the people of Pakistan bypassing the government and the Pakistan Army would have helped India's diplomatic prospects in the region.","title":"India must reach out to all neighbours, including Pakistan, to counter China","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-china-relations-pakistan-maldives-pakistan-army-india-pakistan-relations/story/1/22540.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15260},{"author":"Romita Datta","content":"\"Even roadside telebhaja shops can be a good venture.\" This is what Mamata Banerjee said in February 2015. She was talking about how a tea kiosk, a sweetmeat shop or a telebhaja joint can be considered business options by the unemployed youth of Bengal. She, however, desists from giving the unemployment figures for the state. The telebhaja suggestion plopped in the scene three years before Prime Minister Narendra Modi could cook up the pakora lines, the scent of which is wafting a spicy controversy among the jobless youth of the country. Borrowing a line, frequently borrowed from Gopal Krishna Gokhale by a contemporary Bengali political stalwart, this is a clear case of \"what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow\".Not only this, there are multiple instances of NDA-led Centre thinking on the same lines as the government in Bengal. Sadly, no credits are being attributed to the Bengal chief minister. The BJP is not even ready to acknowledge that \"great men\" think alike and fools seldom differ. Take the case of Kanyashree - the state scheme aimed at empowering girls with a handsome stipend for pursuing higher studies instead of getting married at a young age. It was launched in 2013, exactly two years before PM Modi's \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao\". Though controversy and confusion refuse to die as to which came first - the egg or the chicken - the fact remains both are similar in their intent. The BJP might be claiming that BBBP is a better and more comprehensive policy bringing under its ambit the urgency to stop female foeticide, but the reality is that Kanyashree, being the first of its kind in stopping child marriage and school dropout, has won the hearts of the world winning Mamata the prestigious UN Public Service Day award for it in 2017. The recent spat over Kanyashree and BBBP between the governor of West Bengal Kesri Nath Tripathi and Mamata and her cabinet cronies is again a clear indication that neither is willing to give credit to the other. While Mamata thinks Kanyashree is unmatched in its scale and magnitude - Rs 5,000 crore as against Rs 100 crore yearly for BBBP, the Bengal governor thinks the constant drum-beating for Kanyashree is taking the wind or due credits away from Modi's scheme. Another example of thinking on similar lines is the much-touted Modicare, which is straight out of Mamata's Swasthyasathi - a health protection insurance coverage of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh (in case of critical illness) per year for 55 lakh people, rolled out in 2016. Modicare may be a magnified Swasthyasathi, involving 10 crore families and 50 crore people, but Swasthyasathi covers 1,900 ailments, treatment of which can be done in all government and 500 notified private hospitals. Both ambitious projects, however, have not taken into account the deficiency in infrastructure and the acute crisis of medical personnel. In Bengal, there is a shortfall of 33 per cent medical officers and doctors in the Directorate of Health Services and the picture is more or less similar across the country, where the doctor-patient ratio is 0.6:1,000. The thread of commonality runs beyond schemes and policy. Both do not bother about plurality of opinions in a democracy, majority of their decisions are arbitrary, their exclusive brainchild. Both are sensitive to criticisms, and reflect a poor sense of humour when the guffaw is on them, whereas they can choose to be extremely critical, often nasty, when it comes to pinning down somebody.When it comes to muscle-flexing, one struts around flaunting his 56-inch chest with a \"Big Brother\" attitude, the other prides in being a tiger, the royal Bengal tiger, who cannot be cowed down by agencies and the high-handedness of the Centre. And talk of connecting with people, Modi's \"Mann Ki Baat\" and \"Pariksha Pe Charcha\" draw resonance from Mamata's administrative meetings in the district, where apart from bureaucrats, students and commoners cannot just listen, but also participate. Mamata and Modi share a lot in common. They connect well with the masses, Mamata with her \"ma-maati-manush\", and Modi with \"mitron\". Being completely immersed in work, hardly dedicate anytime for their families. Both follow a strict and simple diet plan, and are committed to staying fit. Their handling of the press, and their ability to decimate the Opposition are much the same. Despite their similarities they appear as different as chalk and cheese. However, their careers have the same story of sweat, blood, humiliation and painstaking struggle. Their stories underline the rise and rise of common men without the backing of a political dynasty - the almost fairytale-like saga of rags to riches of a chaiwala and a woman, who sat at Haringhata Milk booths to deliver milk bottles. So close and yet so far - as Elvis Presley would sing.

The sleepy town boasts of an impressive sex ratio as well as literacy rate. However, it's not known for these reasons but for one man –  . Even though Haasan has spent very few years in Paramakudi, the impact that his family has had on the lives of the people here is immense.  The actor's ancestral house is now owned by Thamilarasu, a physical education teacher and, needless to say, a die-hard Haasan fan. “This is the biggest blessing in my life. I own the house in which Kamal sir too spent some years,” says the physical education teacher. The Thamilarasu family couldn't be happier to be in the spotlight even as their hero is set to  later today (February 21).   The family maintains the house like a shrine and have tried to keep important features of the house unchanged - for instance, the entrance door as carved by Haasan’s father D Srinivasa Iyengar, a painting by elder sister Nalini. “We didn’t want to change anything in the house, but some of them were too old and had to be replaced,” said Reeta, Thamilarasu’s wife. As visitors and fans come knocking on their door to see the house where Kamal Haasan once lived, the Thamilarasu family is more than happy to oblige them. “So many visitors come here, even tourists from Singapore and Malaysia. All his fans can't get enough of the place. Some touch the door, feel the walls, and even kiss the floor, as if it's a temple. It fills the heart with so much joy to see their love and devotion for Kamal sir.” The family’s allegiance towards Haasan knows no bounds. Thamilarasu, who was earlier an active member of Kamal Haasan Fans' Association, once had to spend a day in jail \"fighting\" for a Haasan’s film. He, however, describes the incident as one of the greatest achievements of his life. What's more, until 2014, the electricity bill for Thamilarasu's house used to come in the name of Haasan’s father. Thamilarasu couldn't muster the \"impertinence\" to get the name changed. Recollecting a tough phase in Haasan’s life and how he was able to do his bit, Thamilarasu says: “After the   controversy, Kamal sir had announced that he would leave the country. That time I sent him my house key and said the house still belongs to him. He  doesn't have to go anywhere. I requested him to come back here. Kamal sir still has a key to the house. He  even thanked me in his article in  .”   The sleepy town of Paramakudi not just has \"the honour of hosting\" the actor's ancestral house, but the people here also take immense pride in a primary school that was built by Haasan in his father's memory. While the people of Paramakudi have always loved the well-natured Srinivasa Iyengar and his son Kamal, who put the small town in the world map because of his cinematic skills, the locals here including close family friend advocate G Gopal are confident of his success in politics as well. “I'm sure he must have taken this decision long back and is the right person to join politics. Paramakudi will support him whole-heartedly.\" Despite caste considerations in Tamil Nadu politics, like everywhere else across the country, Paramakudi residents feel the people across the state will embrace their reel hero in their real lives too with open arms. \"Caste and community don't matter… Jayalalithaa was from a minority community. Most Tamil Nadu CMs were from minority community just like Kamal Haasan,\" says another confident Hassan fan. Meanwhile, Thamilarasu has a lot on his mind. He is even ready to quit his government job to go and help out his idol. “If Kamal sir asks me, I will quit my job and join him,” he says even as wife Reeta nods understandably. Kamal Haasan has a huge fan base that has been converted into a welfare association. It is known for carrying out various social welfare measures. The association is now working hard on a membership drive to enrol at least one lakh members before the actor enters electoral politics. While there is no dearth of fans, the question is whether the love of his \"devotees\" will make him a superstar in Tamil Nadu politics too.  ","title":"As Kamal Haasan launches party, this is what his home town Paramakudi expects from him","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kamal-haasan-party-launch-madurai-ancestral-home-paramakudi-fans/story/1/22471.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15262},{"author":"Akshaya Nath","content":"Born to D Srinivasa Iyengar and Rajalakhmi of Paramakudi town, Kamal Haasan might be one of the biggest superstars in Indian cinema, but for the people of Tamil Nadu, especially his hometown, he is still one among them. Paramakudi and its people love the man because of whom their little-known town is in headlines, as the superstar formally began his  today with the launch of Makkal Needhi Maiam. \r\n \r\n Although there are very few people left in his hometown who have personally known the family, every single one of them has fond memories of the enthusiastic, lovable young Haasan. Muthulakshmi, now in her mid-70s, was one of those people who played with Haasan when he was a child. Clad in a black and red sari, her voice changes as she starts recalling Haasan's childhood. “I was around 10 years old when he was a baby. He would never sit still, always up to something. He loved being carried around and I used to do that as they lived in the house next to ours. Aunty (Haasan's mother) used to pass him to me over the fence and I used to play with him.” Muthulakshmi also recalls how inspired by his sister, Haasan started learning dance and even participated in stage shows. Haasan was five years old when he made his debut as a child artist in   While it went on to become one of the best films of the time, young Kamal too received rave reviews for his performance.  “It was a superhit and all of us celebrated it in a big way here. He was our boy,” says Soundarajan, whose family used to run a hotel nearby. Haasan's father was a regular visitor. In fact, after the family initially moved to Chennai and Srinivasa Iyengar stayed back, it was Soundarajan’s Kuppanna Iyengar hotel where he would go to have his breakfast.   After entering showbiz, Haasan had to move to Chennai, something because of which he slowly lost touch with many back in his hometown. One of the last extended family members who still lives in Paramakudi is D Sowmyanarayanan. “I am the only person from the family here in Paramakudi now. Though we are all related, we hardly get to meet each other since most of them moved out of Paramakudi. Moreover, in absence of any elders, that common link is almost dead. I met Charuhasan and Subhashini [Maniratnam], Kamal’s brother and niece, at a wedding recently. But it has been a really long time since I last met Kamal.” But there are a few with whom the Haasan family continues to be in regular touch. Haasan’s neighbour in Paramakudi, advocate G Gopal, is one such person. In fact, the families still pay visits to one another. Talking about young Kamal’s love for cinema, Gopal says, “Kamal was in love with movies, as a child too. In fact, there was this MGR film,  , which ran for 100 days in Paramakudi, and Kamal had seen it every single day.” \"When he got his first ambassodor car, I was there at his Alwarpet residence in Chennai. Rajalakshmi Amma said ‘Gopalaa let’s go and take a ride'. Kamal’s mom and I were the first ones to sit in his car.”  Over the years these friends and well-wishers have turned into Kamal’s greatest supporters in public life too. In many occasions when he landed in controversies, they are were the first ones to lend their shoulders. One such recent incident was when Haasan was called “anti-Hindu” because of his remarks about sexism in   and even targetted him for his alleged Islamic faith.  “Kamal got the Haasan surname because of D Srinivasa Iyengar, who as a tribute to his friendship with Yaakob Haasan, with whom he briefly shared a prison cell during the freedom struggle, gave the surname to all his children. His father valued his friendships a lot,” adds Gopal.  The actor though in his interviews has given an alternative explanation too. According to him, Kamal means lotus and Haasan is derived from hasya, meaning laughter in Sanskrit.   As the man embarks on his political journey, the one aspect he is threading carefully and focussing on is the need for peace irrespective of religion, caste or creed.

Of course, in the United States, a history of mental illness and violent tendencies is no barrier to getting a weapon capable of murder, so we have such tragedies. Indeed, under Donald Trump, the government has actually  restrictions on gun purchases by citizens with mental illnesses. Yet, while the United States’ gun culture doesn’t fit into any medical definition of mental illness, it is clear the US has a pathological relationship with guns. I didn’t always think United States’ gun culture was so sick. It often takes leaving home to truly understand a place, and I only fully appreciated the depth of United States’ obsession with guns after spending a year in England in my mid-20s. During that time, a shooter killed 32 people at Virginia Tech, then the United States’ record for the worst shooting in a single day. Sadly, in the United States’ tradition of excess and violence, we have since broken that record. And broken it several times. The shooting dominated the news, and it served as a topic of conservation for several days in the house. I explained the American conservative reaction to my housemates, and they were utterly incapable of understanding it. When I explained to many in my country school that shootings are a sign that gun laws are too loose and that instead we need better laws to protect people, they didn’t simply disagree. They seemed unable to understand how anyone could ever come to that conclusion. To them, it wasn’t a reasonable argument they disagreed with. Rather, they saw it as completely irrational, the logic of a lunatic. This was my first time having a sustained conversation outside the United States about my country’s gun policies, and I was seeing it through new eyes. Although I always disagreed with the notion that more guns means more safety, for me, it always had a coherence. The reaction of my roommates made me question that. It made me realise just how unhinged the United States’ gun culture is, how divorced it is from fact and reason, and how hard it can be to truly gain that perspective from within the country. The United States’ veneration of guns is dogmatic, hard-wired into our culture. The weapon is venerated in our movies, and   it at  . We are one of the   where gun rights are enshrined in the Constitution, and the only one of those countries where it is unrestricted. This devotion to the second amendment and its right to bear arms has all the trappings of religious dogma, a belief in a worldview that cannot be changed by empirical reality. In one particularly moving essay, Gary Willis  our love of guns to the worship of Moloch described in the bible, a deity whose followers sacrificed their children in devotion to their God. Perhaps, no greater sign of gun rights dogmatism, of the complete opposition to the empirical reality found by those who oppose modest gun control is the fact that, starting in 1996, the Congress  the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from studying the link between guns and public health. The CDC is the main government public health institution, and somehow they are forbidden from studying a tool that kills more than 30,000 Americans a year. Literally, more than one per cent of Americans die of  , yet the national government refuses to invest in studying this. It is no coincidence that the same side of American politics that irrationally refuses to acknowledge a link between guns and gun violence shows a similar incoherence with global warming — an unwillingness to engage in discussion about the deepening crisis. Sure, 17 children are dead but don’t comment on the tool of violence, lest you politicise the event. Yes, Houston is submerged under a biblical flood but don’t link it to the scientific consensus. Often, after these shootings, politicians say we need a renewed focus on treating mental illness, as if that is the variable that is the problem rather than the simple fact that the country has too many of these weapons of death. There are literally   in this country as there are people. People are people, and mental illness will always exist. Semiautomatic weapons however do not always exist, and they definitely don’t need to be sold to the public. Yet, until my country begins to accept the reality, to recognise that just as surely as the sun rises in the east, letting people collect innumerable and immensely powerful guns will result in death, we are destined to suffer more deaths. That’s reality. There has been one glimmer of hope this weekend. In the wake of the shooting, survivors of the attack have been engaged in a   of public activism over gun control. On Saturday, at a rally, Emma Gonzales, a survivor of the shooting, gave a speech that quickly went viral. At the end, she led a call and response where the crowd chanted “we call BS” on the idea that gun policy can’t lead to a decrease in gun deaths. In the age of fake news and delusion, when obvious facts are ignored with deadly consequences, it was inspiring to see students so clearly and boldly state to their older leaders that they will actively oppose their obvious lies. There is a simplicity and clarity to their call that is undeniable, and it gives me hope that perhaps more American politicians and voters, too, will begin to acknowledge the reality.","title":"Why United States takes its guns to school","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/florida-mass-shooting-kills-17-gun-control-us-second-amendment/story/1/22434.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15264},{"author":"Anand Kochukudy","content":"The   of Youth Congress block secretary, SP Shuhaib, is the latest in the long list of political   since half a century. Incidentally, one of the accused in the 1969 murder that set off this cycle of violence is incumbent chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and it was widely hoped he would be the one to bell the cat. But as the number of political murders in his less than two-year term stand at 22, one has to assume that the chief minister, who also holds the state home ministry, has failed in this endeavour miserably. At around 11.15pm on February 12, a four-member gang arrived at a roadside eatery in a car and hurled two crude bombs. Two men with machetes pounced on Shuhaib and they hacked him repeatedly below his waist. The post-mortem report records 41 hack wounds, of which 37 were inflicted below his waist. The gruesome attack reminded Keralites of a similar barbaric attack on renegade Marxist TP Chandrasekharan in 2012 by cadres of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A video of CPM flag-bearing activists airing death threats against Shuhaib has surfaced, pointing the finger of suspicion clearly at the ruling party in the state. The CPM workers' rant \"your days are numbered\" can be clearly heard in the video. Meanwhile, CPM's Kannur district secretary P Jayarajan had declared that they have nothing to do with the murder. (Similar declarations were also made in the wake of TP Chandrasekharan's murder by then state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan). With the surrender of two CPM members - Akash Thillangeri and Rijin Raj - following a search operation at \"party villages\" in Kannur, these declarations by senior leaders have been belied. What makes the latest murder stand out from the spate of murders in the last couple of decades is the fact that it has the potential to initiate a new wave of violence and drag Congress back into Kannur's murder politics. The Kannur feud, involving CPM and BJP/RSS since the 1980s, has dominated the discourse on the politics of murders as other parties such as the Muslim League and the Congress have gradually scaled down their involvement in violence. Congress, in particular, has completely abandoned it since 2000. While the party was in the thick of things in the 1970s, they have been on the sidelines of extermination politics since the 1980s despite remaining the primary Opposition party in the state and the district. Congress' Kannur face K Sudhakaran has begun a 48-hour fast from Monday and has warned of converting it into an indefinite hunger strike if the \"real\" culprits aren't arrested by then. Kannur's cycle of violence sustains on \"proxy culprits\" in which the parties involved present proxies in place of real perpetrators in connivance with police officers that ultimately leads to acquittals at the trial stage. Shuhaib was a protege of Sudhakaran and was also actively involved in religious and charitable activities of Sunni Students' Federation (SSF), the youth wing of AP Sunni faction. Incidentally, the AP Sunnis led by Kanthapuram Aboobackar Musaliar has always backed the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala and this murder spoil things altogether. What began as a local Kerala Students Union (KSU)-Students Federation of India (SFI) skirmish (Student bodies of Congress and CPM intensified when Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU)-the Marxist trade union arm-workers got involved). But how did it lead to such a brutal murder? Shuhaib's uncle Ismail reveals that his nephew was a CPM sympathiser, who moved to the Congress before 2015 though he never revealed the reason for that switch. Shuhaib had led the Congress' civic poll campaign in Edayannur and Therur wards in the CPM-dominated Keezhallur panchayat. With his influence in SSF, Congress won both wards. Congress won even without the backing of its ally Indian Union Muslim League in these wards - which rang alarm bells in CPM that enjoys dominance in these parts of Kannur. Apostasy is not taken lightly in Marxist strongholds and Congress' abandonment of extermination politics has seen a large number of ex-CPM cadres flocking to BJP/RSS and even vice versa. Ideology is secondary when it comes to such abandonments as the primary motive is to settle scores or self-preservation. Shuhaib's murder is also reminiscent of the , a Muslim League student leader in 2012 in Kannur. Incidentally, Thalassery MLA AN Shamseer owned up to the murder during a television debate. While CPM used the minority protection card in the 2016 Assembly elections, Shuhaib's murder may not go down well with many in the community. It has also come to light that an attack might have been planned on Shuhaib in   where rules are regularly flouted by political prisoners in connivance with police officials. When Shuhaib was arrested after a clash with CPM on January 13, the magistrate court ordered that he be lodged in the sub-jail for undertrials. But in an inexplicable move, he was swiftly shifted to the special sub-jail located in the Kannur central jail. K Sudhakaran had intervened with jail DGP R Sreelekha to shift him back to the sub-jail then. Shuhaib's father, Muhammed, was also aware of the threats to his son's life and has confirmed receiving such messages on his phone. Shuhaib was the sole breadwinner of his family comprising three sisters. The human suffering in Kannur's murder politics is often a neglected topic. Political murders have crippled many families in this district and while parties use them as \"martyrs\" to further their politics, the families are left to suffer. A few months back, BJP had unleashed a campaign nationally against the ruling CPM accusing them of spreading \"red terror\" in Kerala. People of Kerala were unanimous in thwarting the propaganda and were quick to point out that it wasn't a unidimensional issue. Marxists will have to come around the reality that extermination politics has no place in a civilised society in 2018. A lot of their omissions and commissions have been conveniently ignored over the years due to their utility in preventing the growth of communal politics in Kerala, where people live in complete harmony. But if these murders keep repeating every now and then under their rule, one will have to question their commitment to law and order. While they claim to have lost more people than the BJP/RSS since the 1980s, these arguments fall apart if we are to take into account the past two years alone of Vijayan's chief ministership. CPM has lost only three lives against seven on the other side in Kannur in this brief period. Chief minister Vijayan chose to remain mum on this ghastly incident for six days. He only spoke on February 18. It seems the transformation from being the ringleader of Marxist politics in Kannur to the people's chief minister hasn't been an easy one. But if the police choose to act as an extension of the party in this case (Kannur SP has upbraided his subordinates for leaking information to the party and has officially complained to the state DGP), a new wave of violence will be the natural consequence and Kerala can ill-afford setting the clock back.","title":"Killing of Youth Congress leader SP Shuhaib may spark a wave of violence in Kerala","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/political-violence-in-kerala-sp-shuhaib-communists-pinarayi-vijayan-kerala-kannur/story/1/22440.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15265},{"author":"Harsh V Pant","content":"Hassan Rouhani’s visit to Delhi was the first by an Iranian president in 10 years and it was much needed. His talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi were deemed substantive and the two leaders emphasised the need to build stronger relations. Modi suggested that the visit by the Iranian president underscored how the two sides want to deepen cooperation in key areas, including connectivity, even as Rouhani repeated his nation’s resolve “to combat terrorism and extremism”. A dozen pacts were signed including one on double taxation avoidance and another for the leasing by an Indian company of a container terminal facility in Iran’s Chabahar port. But the Indo-Iranian relations are facing some strong headwinds. Last month Donald Trump decided not to pull Washington out of a deal that it and other world powers made with Tehran to limit Iran’s nuclear programme. But he gave a strong warning to other countries in the deal. Make the deal tougher, or the US will stop keeping its end of the bargain with sanctions relief. At the same time, the Trump administration has imposed new targeted sanctions on 14 Iranian individuals and entities in connection with various human rights abuses. This was the same strategy that Washington adopted last year when it waived the sanctions but imposed sanctions on seven targets involved in Iran’s ballistic missile programme, including two senior Iranian defence officials, one of whom allegedly helps to arm Assad and a China-based network that allegedly supports Iran’s military by supplying millions of dollars’ worth of items used in missile production. The US president had informed the US Congress in October last year that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is no longer in the country’s national security interest, calling it the “worst deal ever”. But instead of scrapping the deal outright, he had put the ball in Congress’ court asking the legislators to modify the agreement even as his administration marshals international support to increase pressure on Iran. Defying Trump, the European Union made it clear that it would defend the agreement. Though European officials have tried for a unified response to Trump’s pulling out from the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord, strains have emerged within that threaten to weaken Europe’s common stance. The European Union has made it clear that it is not open for renegotiation. The British, French and Germans have been lobbying hard to keep the Trump administration in, arguing that the deal is working. As West Asia continues to pass through a phase of unprecedented churn, Iran has emerged as, perhaps, the most potent force in the region. The US is itself responsible for this as its removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, which had always been a strategic counterweight to Tehran, resulted in this situation. Tehran has been effective in leveraging the regional realities to serve its foreign policy agenda. With the Islamic State (ISIS) facing a regional retreat, proxy wars are underway in Iraq and Syria for a distribution of the spoils. Iran’s influence over the Shia-dominated government and many militia forces in Iraq has given Tehran unprecedented leverage in shaping the political future of Iraq. And in Syria, Iran’s sustained backing of the Assad regime has made the survival of the regime possible despite the challenge posed by the US-backed groups. With their position entrenched in Syria and their influence in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen secure, Iran and Hezbollah and their Shiite allies believe they have built a formidable, unified, border-spanning front. How they choose to exert their power could dictate the future trajectory of the wider West Asia. Israel and Iran are coming to blows in Syria. As a result, despite Trump’s threats, Iran is placed much better in the region than ever before. But tensions between Washington and Tehran constrain the strategic space for India in dealing with Iran. New Delhi has, therefore, welcomed the 2015 nuclear deal. Given the isolation facing Washington on its new Iran policy, India may not have to worry too much in the immediate future. In fact, what should be more worrying for India is the slow pace of the Chabahar port project, which has irked the Iranians, and they have indicated that despite India developing the project, it won’t be exclusive to the country. Pakistan and China might also be invited to get involved. Chabahar is seen as India’s answer to the Gwadar port, which will allow it to circumvent Pakistan and open up a route to landlocked Afghanistan. Bringing China and Pakistan in will be a challenge to Indian interests. Uncertainty surrounding American posture towards Iran is complicating India’s ability to deliver fast on Chabahar as Western manufacturers remain wary of supplying equipment for the Iranian port. The first phase of the project was completed and inaugurated in December but much more remains to be done before the project becomes the strategic nodal point that New Delhi perhaps wants it to be. The Indo-Iranian cooperation on Afghanistan is also coming under stress with Tehran joining Russia and China in managing Pakistan’s role in the region. The ISIS is viewed as the bigger threat in Afghanistan than the Taliban by these states. Though the larger trade and energy ties between India and Iran are gradually growing, they are being overshadowed by India’s growing stakes in the Arab world and Israel. The Iranian president’s visit to India has made a modest effort towards adding dynamism to Indo-Iranian ties. It remains to be seen how far this will go as a new power configuration emerges in India’s extended neighbourhood which India will have to navigate carefully.

For the common man what matters is that this mega scam has tumbled out of the closet during the Modi government. Therefore, this development will inevitably have some kind of negative impact. The million dollar question is whether the Modi government will bear political losses or will the Opposition reap some political benefits from this development? Well, the answer is in the womb of time and will be known upfront on March 3 when the results of   are out. Yes, the results of Nagaland and Meghalaya Assembly polls too will be out on that day but the BJP doesn't have much electoral presence of its own in these two northeastern states. Tripura results should serve as the answer, politically speaking, as the top leadership of the BJP is actively involved in these elections, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself. Ground reports suggest the BJP was well poised to give the CPM-ruled government of chief minister Manik Sarkar a run for its money. The BJP was seen as a serious contender with the potential to emerge victorious in the Tripura elections and end the 20-year-old rule of the Manik Sarkar government. But this was before the PNB fraud flew into the face of the BJP government at the Centre. PM Modi is adept at coining political catchphrases and words during election campaigns which have invariably cost the Opposition dear. Who can, for instance, forget his  in the middle of Uttar Pradesh elections which eventually pulled the carpet from under the feet of the Opposition and installed a BJP government with an unprecedented majority in India's most populous and electorally the biggest state - and that too a crucial swing state? PM Modi came up with a similar clever remark during Tripura election campaigning when he said this at a public rally: \"It is as if an astrologer has given you a Manik (gemstone) to wear and it has turned out to be the wrong Manik (read chief minister Manik Sarkar). So while the country developed, achhe din never came to Tripura. It is time to take off the wrong Manik and instead I offer you a HIRA - Highways, I-ways, Railways and Airways.\" He made this remark at an election rally in Sonamura, Tripura on February 9. Little did he realise that a crowning irony was waiting to happen with \"Hira\" (diamond) trader Nirav Modi rocking his boat in a big way. Thus his remark that the people of Tripura should shun \"Manik\" or gem (chief minister Manik Sarkar) and embrace \"HIRA\" (diamond) unintentionally turned ironical. Normally, national issues hardly dominate the agenda and outcome of state assembly polls, much less in context of the far-flung northeastern states. But Tripura, a traditional Left bastion where the BJP tried its hardest to dictate a new political narrative and change the political discourse, may well prove to be a different case altogether. Away from the glare of northeastern politics, the PNB fraud is likely to have an adverse economic fallout. It may compel rating agencies such as Moody's to downgrade India's ratings. It may also adversely impact the carefully nurtured image of the Modi government in terms of Ease of Doing Business and inflict political costs on the Modi government. The Opposition has already got hold of an important political stick to beat the Modi government with. The social media is full of derisive variations of PM Modi's  : \"Na khaoonga, na khaane doonga\" (I will neither indulge in corruption nor allow others a chance to be corrupt). The trending message on social media is: \"Na khaoonga, na khaane doonga; sirf bhaagne doonga\" (Won't indulge in corruption, won't allow others to be corrupt; but will allow the corrupt to escape).\" If the court   had come before Gujarat went to polls, the results (BJP 99, Congress 80) could have been different. But the PNB fraud case has panned out before Tripura polls. Cases like these have the potential to influence both national and state level politics. Whether the fraud impacts the Tripura polls remains to be seen. The Tripura results will determine whether the impact of national events on state Assembly polls is just a speculation or a stark reality. If despite this the BJP wins Tripura and unseats the ruling CPM, it will only go to show that Modi's Teflon image is still intact. A contrary result will prove the opposite. This, in turn, would mean that Modi's BJP would have a lot to worry about in its Mission 2019.","title":"How Nirav Modi swindling Punjab National Bank of Rs 11,000cr will impact Modi government","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tripura-elections-nirav-modi-narendra-modi-bjp-lok-sabha-polls-pnb-fraud/story/1/22407.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15267},{"author":"Geeta Mohan","content":"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's   to India marks the beginning of a greater India-Canada cooperation. A global leader, who has become the face of free voice, diversity and unity, comes to India at a time when we are grappling with the issue of \"tolerance\". In the entire insider-outsider, us versus them debate, Trudeau has shone like a beacon of light for those who wish to see alleviation and elimination of such a vicious global environment. \r\n \r\n He has invited with open arms those who have been shunned in their own homeland, those who look to Canada for a brighter future, those who need space to be heard. Trudeau has been an answer to scores of Indians as well. In 2016 alone, around 40,000 Indian immigrants found home in Canada. Today the Indian community in Canada makes up for a significant vote bank and some have made it to Trudeau's cabinet. The reason why this visit is more important to Canada than maybe to India is the huge constituency Prime Minister Trudeau has to cater to back home, the huge Indian community, particularly from Punjab. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always considered the Indian community living overseas an important component of his foreign policy toolkit. As part of India's \"soft power\" policy, Indians living abroad have become \"influencers\". But Canada is a unique case where while we have Indian origin parliamentarians contending to become PM, we also have some members of the very same community supporting growing Sikh radicalism that is reviving the Khalistani movement in Canada. A matter of grave concern to India. One that has been raised by India at all official levels. India and Canada have grown leaps and bounds when it comes to trade, investment and the energy sectors although both agree there is room for more. But the area that we have lagged behind in is security and the strategic sphere. Do our interests converge? Are we on the same page when it comes to security concerns? Security isn't about regional and global arena. It starts from home. The questions that are being raised are whether both countries would be able to find a way to understand each other's concerns. India has made amply clear the impact this resurgence could have on India's security. But, Trudeau looks at the community as a celebration of cultures and peoples. He in fact attended an event in April 2017 in Toronto which had Khalistani flags and pictures of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a terrorist killed in action in Punjab, put up everywhere. Unaware or unconcerned of the sensitivity involved? There is a reason why Canadian leadership has tread very carefully in the past on the issue because the 1985 Kanishka bombing, which killed a total of 329 people, including 268 Canadians, 27 Britishers and 24 Indians; remains a reminder of the devastation such movements can cause. Canada might have moved on and away from this horrid past, but this continues to remain a part of the conversations between India and Canada. While India has been engaging Canada to look at the bigger picture and not get confined in petty political bickering, the fact is that there is more to the ties between India and Canada and hence the need to delink the \"Khalistan\" issue from the substantive part of our ties. India and Canada have many areas in which they can benefit from mutual cooperation. Trade, job creation, investment sector are just some of those areas. Apart from this, climate change, and counter-terrorism (every vote at the world body counts) are areas where the two countries can benefit by working closely. Canada has   India's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. There is much to gain for both the countries. But much more can be achieved if the leaders' can find common grounds on all issues. Canada will have to differentiate between \"diversity\" and \"extremism\" and India will have to make a distinction between \"freedom of speech and action\" and \"intolerance\" in the name of that same freedom.","title":"Can India and Canada use Justin Trudeau's visit to move beyond Khalistan","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/justin-trudeau-canada-khalistan-nsg-toronto-extremism-diversity/story/1/22408.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15268},{"author":"Asit Jolly","content":"Captain Amarinder Singh’s consistent refusal to engage with Sikh ministers within Canada’s federal government who were reported to have Khalistani leanings has forced the ministers to clarify their position. The denials by defence minister Harjit Singh Sajjan and infrastructure minister Amarjit Sohi have been issued just days ahead of, and evidently prompted by, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s first state visit to India later this month. Reports in the Canadian media have quoted Sohi as saying that “he does not sympathise with the cause (Khalistan), nor does he hear much talk about it in the (Canadian) Sikh community.” Sajjan, who was refused an audience by the Punjab chief minister when he visited Chandigarh and Punjab last year (2017) because of his purported “Khalistani connections,” also refuted the charge as being “ridiculous.” The Canadian defence minister said in Ottawa: “I’ve been a police officer, I’ve served my country and any allegations like that is absolutely ridiculous and I find it extremely offensive as well.” Reflecting the growing political influence of the Sikh community in Canada, as many as 16 MPs of Sikh origin were elected in the federal elections in 2015. But this has been accompanied by a visible proliferation of Khalistani separatists, who have reportedly been employing North American gurudwaras to continue fuelling demands for “liberating Punjab from Indian domination.” In fact, there have been worrying reports of Khalistanis forcibly preventing Indian representatives and officials from entering gurudwaras in Canada. Police and intelligence officials in Punjab claim that Canada-based Khalistanis and their sympathisers contribute the largest chunk of illegal hawala funding that is being used to try and revive the moribund separatist movement in Punjab. Although Prime Ministers Trudeau and Narendra Modi appear to share a comfortable rapport and have met one-on-one on the sidelines of several international meetings, including most recently, the World Economic Forum at Davos, the free rein given to Khalistanis in Canada has cast a shadow on Trudeau's upcoming five-day visit. The trip, slated to focus on trade and cultural ties between the two countries, significantly includes a visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Commentators say, given that Indo-Canadians now number at 1.2 million, the India-Punjab visit could boost Trudeau’s prospects for re-election. Reportedly advised to make amends, Sohi has clarified his position: “If there is a small segment of people in Canada who talk about separation, who talk about the creation of Khalistan, if they do that in a peaceful way that is their right to do so but this is not an issue that I hear in the community,” the minister was quoted (in Canadian media) as having said in Ottawa. “From my point of view this is not an issue for the Canadian population, this is not an issue for the Indo-Canadian community within Canada, and I don’t feel it necessary to be engaging in something that is completely irrelevant from a Canadian’s point of view.” Quick to respond, Amarinder welcomed the clarifications by Sajjan and Sohi. “I congratulate Prime Minister Trudeau for creating the necessary environment against secessionist forces believed to be operating from his country,” the chief minister said. It’s typically Amarinder to take what may seem like a contentious position to many, and then stick to his guns. On a visit to Toronto during his earlier, 2002-2007, tenure as CM, Amarinder was accused of \"hob-nobbing with Khalistanis\". His rivals in the Shiromani Akali Dal quite literally went to town decrying his visit to a \"Khalistani\" gurudwara in Dixieland (Toronto). Local media in Punjab was flooded with pictures showing the chief minister standing below a \"Khalistan Zindabad\" banner while addressing a congregation inside the shrine. Unperturbed, Amarinder called a news conference in Chandigarh. “Any gurudwara is the home of my Gurus and I reserve the right to go there. hanging up nonsensical banners doesn’t change that and I will never be deterred from going to any gurudwara,” he told visibly surprised reporters who had come expecting long, convoluted explanations, even an apology?

Where were the two hundred thousand karsevaks that we were expecting? We smelt a rat. Was the press meeting hogwash then? Did the leaders have other plans up their sleeves? Upon reflection, I have felt that the Babri Masjid would have stayed intact if the plans were not changed at the eleventh hour. While the mosque was being destroyed and was falling like the wall of Jericho, we heard that it was Vinay Katiyar who pressurised the leaders of the movement against a symbolic karseva. He argued that repeated tokenism in the name of karseva would not go down well with the devotees who had been clamouring for action for a long time. Katiyar was the chief of Bajrang Dal. He had won the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in the 1991 general elections. He is a belligerent man, who does not mince words. When during the karseva in October 1991, a few young men scaled the dome of the Masjid, Katiyar had to face the wrath of the karsevaks in trying to dissuade them. This time round, he wanted a more concrete action plan that would satisfy his supporters. The karsevaks were in no mood to leave the Masjid premises and go to the banks of the Sarayu. When we reached the karseva venue, BP Toshniwal endorsed the changed plan. “It has been decided at the last moment that the karsevaks would congregate at the Rama Katha Kunj ground, from where they would be sent in small batches to the venue,” he said. In other words, they would be spared the long walk. The decision seemed justified and never did we anticipate that the assembling two hundred thousand karsevaks near the venue could be part of a bigger agenda, until around an hour later, when the first signs of lawlessness became visible. While we were talking to Toshniwal, the Rama Katha Kunj and its approach road were overflowing with karsevaks. RSS volunteers were manning the Rama Deewar with great alacrity. Ram Shankar Agnihotri, the loudmouth spokesman of the VHP, had informed us that a special arrangement for journalists had been made on the roof of Manas Bhavan, adjacent to the venue on its eastern side. But who would care for a seat in the stands when one could get a decidedly better view from the sidelines? I proudly displayed the pink press card given by the VHP and was promptly allowed by RSS volunteers inside the mosque premises. When I had come to cover the karseva in July, I noticed that the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh led by Kalyan Singh had changed the very look of the mosque premises. It had acquired 2.77 acres of land next to the mosque and levelled it. There was no sign of the spot which was the centre of dispute owing to the laying of the foundation stone of the temple in 1989. Instead, the July karseva aimed at laying the foundation of the main entrance of the temple designed by Sompura. The gate would be 166 feet long and 80 feet wide. Throwing the court order to the wind, the July karseva ended after the foundation was laid. The December karseva was meant to “cleanse” this foundation. A crowd of hardly 500 volunteers and sadhus greeted us at the site. A copper pot adorned with a vermilion swastika was shining in the morning sun, right in the middle of the site. All arrangements for an elaborate puja were complete, with the whole area decked up with mango leaves, garlands and flower petals. Acharya Bamdev was supposed to preside over the official karseva at quarter past twelve. That would mean that the sadhus would start the puja and cleansing of the platform while the karsevaks, in small batches, would fill the cavities with sand. Tej Shankar, the royally treated Supreme Court observer, seemed happy with the proceedings. The evening before, he had faxed the apex court that all was well and in keeping with the court’s directives. That is, no construction work was happening in the acquired land. One of the first to arrive at the venue was Acharya Haricharan Das of the Vaishnava sect of Chitrakoot and with him a teenaged sadhu who was a sight to behold. Wearing a turmeric-coloured dhoti tied like a lungi, Raghunandan had covered his upper torso with a namavali printed with “Hare Krishna Hare Rama” (a namavali is a shawl with names of gods printed on it). Every part of his body, the shaven head downwards was covered with the red of the tilak. The first thing he did after taking his seat was to bring out two shovels from his bag. Dharamdas, the six-and-a-half-foot tall sadhu, who was nearby, promptly held him by his neck and threw him out of the premises. It seemed that Dharamdas, the pehalwan who shadowed Katiyar wherever he went, was there to ensure that the court directive was complied with in letter and spirit. Certainly a teenaged sadhu had no business to defy court orders under his nose. Even as Raghunandan was trying to gather himself from the sudden assault, about 200 karsevaks were trying to elbow their way in. All of them were wielding trishuls. Many of the jawans of Provincial Arms Constabulary (PAC) had vermilion tilaks on their foreheads and even the RSS knew that they were hardly dependable. The RSS volunteers themselves formed the second line of defence behind these PAC jawans. One of them assured the police, “Don’t you worry. We’ll handle this”. The PAC jawans were only too happy to have this assurance. The PAC, a paramilitary outfit, formed during the regime of chief minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari, had never remained neutral during communal riots in the state. Every time a karseva took place in Ayodhya, the PAC stood behind the karsevaks openly. It would have been impossible for the karsevaks to break the security cordon and reach Ayodhya during the karseva of 1990, if the PAC had firmly stood its ground. The karsevaks’ happiness with the PAC was in equal measure of their unhappiness with the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force). The moment the PAC distanced itself from the scene, a scuffle ensued between the RSS volunteers and the karsevaks. A deluge of karsevaks kept lashing at the gate. Moments later, they were hounded away by the volunteers. The resistance lasted for not more than fifteen minutes. About 150 young men with trishuls and iron rods barged in at the site. The karsevaks went into a tizzy, gyrating with chants of “Jai Shri Ram”. This “Rama dance” which was a mixture of tandava, breakdance and disco, was also a by-product of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Maniram from Rajasthan was one of the revellers. His wafer-thin torso bore obvious signs of poverty, but that did not take away his zeal. He accosted me, looked into my eyes and my press card, and with a frightening frown yelled, “Jai Shri Ram”. I repeated the chant with him, something that I had learnt to do with experience. And then I asked, almost apologetically, “What about the court orders?” Moments later, I was surrounded by ten other karsevaks, spitting venom at the court and telling me in no uncertain terms that a media person would be better off by staying away from the scene. An RSS volunteer came to my rescue and with folded hands asked me to move away. Arguing would be foolhardy, I thought and moved to a nearby hillock that till the previous year housed the police control room. I saw Shrish Chandra Dikshit, former DIG of UP police-turned-BJP MP from Varanasi and vice president of the VHP, in a saffron cap, sitting on a brick. Giving him company were Uma Shankar Bajpai, DIG of Faizabad division, along with the leader of the almost non-existent Panther Party of Kahsmir, Bhim Singh, with his journalist wife, Sheela. Amid the din and bustle, Ashok Singhal entered the site from the Hanumangarh Road, accompanying Shiv Sena MP Moreshwar Save. A huge cheer of “Har Har Mahadev, Har Bhavani” greeted them. Singhal showed him around, as though Save was a VVIP. In about ten minutes came LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, both with grim faces. Joshi exchanged greetings with us and almost like a soliloquy said, “Let’s see what happens”. And then both the BJP leaders left, taking the approach road off Hanumangarh, to the roof of the VHP office in Rama Katha Kunj that was turned into a makeshift dais for the leaders after the crowd was shifted from the banks of the Sarayu. All the while, the number of karsevaks at the Sankat Mochan gate was increasing like floodwater. The RSS volunteers were now clearly being outnumbered and many of them were injured during the scuffle. Next to the gate were three metal detectors leading into three narrow lanes. This was the official route for the devotees to enter the structure housing the “Ramlala”. A few karsevaks chose to climb atop the metal detectors and were dangling their feet from above. Dharamdas was trying in vain to dissuade them. I suddenly found three journalist friends, Manimoy Dasgupta and Ashok Malik of   and SNM Abdi of  , beside me. “We have just surveyed the back of the mosque. A few hundred karsevaks with spades and shovels have assembled there. I have a fear that they will demolish the mosque today,” said a visibly frightened Abdi. “Do not read much into those preparations. Even if someone scales the tombs of the mosque, they will raise a saffron flag there and nothing more. Similar things happened last year on 31 October, CRPF jawans pulled them down,” I assured Abdi. Abdi’s worst fears came true, but at least, at that point in time, I had confidence on the political will and the discipline of the RSS leaders. I was proved wrong. I was smoking, a few too many cigarettes than I normally would. Shankar, a karsevak from Baramati in Maharashtra, the home turf of Sharad Pawar, came up and asked for a smoke. “It’s futile to lecture us on the court orders. Every time, we are being made pawns of a stupid political game. It’s now or never,” he warned. Even as we spoke, I saw a group of young men in yellow headbands rushing through the approach road gate. They were members of RSS’s Rapid Action Force. They pounced on the euphoric karsevaks and beat them out of the territory. A photo journalist, a foreigner, was trying to take snaps. “No photo, no photo,” screamed a few members of the RSS’s force. Some of them chased him. The poor man lost his balance and fell on some loose bricks. The RSS volunteers seemed teeming with confidence, having won this pitched battle. The battles went on for an hour. And the RSS volunteers were up against a formidable enemy, egged on by local leader Mahesh Narayan Singh. “Those who are combating us are not disciples of Rama. And neither are they karsevaks. They are plants of VP Singh, Mulayam Singh and Narasimha Rao. Do not fall into their traps,” he kept thundering. Dharamdas was at his job. He snatched a cane rod from a PAC jawan and started beating up the karsevaks mercilessly. Moments later, I saw him lying on the ground, with a few karsevaks sitting on him and beating him black and blue. Dharamdas was a wise man. He clearly saw this as a lost battle, somehow regained his foothold and ran away for dear life, clutching at his saffron dhoti. That was the final frontier that the karsevaks had to cross. With his exit, the floodgates were thrown open. Hundreds of karsevaks romped through the various entry points and, like a herd of wild bison, ran towards the mosque. I looked around and found no trace of Dixit or Bhim Singh or his wife. Geetha Siddharthan of the   was the only person other than me on the hillock. To my utter disbelief, I saw that two youths had scaled the middle tomb and were dancing away to glory. Even a moment before this, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar had no inkling of the madness that was happening at the karseva site. Sitting pretty on the roof of the VHP office, they mistook the battle sounds for some street brawl. The top leaders of the Sangh Parivar, Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Ashok Singhal, HV Seshadri, KS Sudarshan, Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Rithambara were enjoying the December sun and cracking jokes among themselves. It was a picnic alright. Seshadri and Sudarshan, two very influential leaders of the RSS, had been camping in Ayodhya for a week now. They had visited every camp of the karsevaks and explained to them in great detail the court orders and how important it was to maintain discipline. These leaders were confident that no one from the Sangh Parivar would dare defy them. And they were there in person to ensure that everything went smoothly. Although Advani reached the pinnacle of political success riding on the wave of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, the BJP had done precious little for the cause before the summer of 1989. It was Ashok Singhal, the all-powerful general secretary of the VHP, who led the movement from the front. He got together sadhus from across the country and united them. Singhal nursed a grief within, as he was not so much in the limelight as an Advani or a Joshi was, but he was politically astute enough not to bring it out in the open. However, his attitude reflected his confidence and arrogance. He hated the so-called “pseudo-secular press” with all the contempt at his command. The two undisputed queen bees of the movement were Uma Bharti and Sadhvi Rithambara. Both were powerful orators and rabble-rousers who could address a captive audience for hours. In terms of popularity among the karsevaks, they were way ahead of Advani or Joshi. Uma reached Ayodhya a few days before December 6. Rithambara was seen on the spot only on that morning. Advani and Joshi came to Ayodhya from Lucknow where they addressed a rally along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Vajpayee, as was always his wont, did not participate in the karseva and went back to Delhi. It was anyway a big day for journalists, just to have all the top leaders of the Sangh Parivar on the same dais in an open arena. Vinay Katiyar was the man in charge. Clad in an impeccably creased white dhoti–kurta, he started off the proceedings at the stroke of eleven. Yugpurush Paramanand, the guru of Rithambara, explained how the karseva would be conducted. Ashok Singhal warned the crowd not to fall prey to the provocative stories that the media was writing about the karseva and not to breach discipline. As it happened, the crowd did not give two hoots about Singhal’s diktat on discipline but they certainly did take a cue from him on how to handle the press. Murli Manohar Joshi, the then BJP president whose journey to Ayodhya from Delhi proved disastrous, was visibly moved to see an ocean of humanity in front of him. In a trembling voice, he delivered a speech, the high point of which was a comparison of Arjun Singh, the Union human resource development minister with a eunuch. Rajmata Scindia was worse off. She could not hold back her tears of joy and could only say a small prayer that the temple be built. The Queen Mother of Gwalior, who had disowned her son Madhav Rao, had been a venerable figure in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In 1990, she tried to organise a large number of karsevaks to march to Ayodhya. Again in July 1992, when the sadhus were at a loss on how to react to the Supreme Court verdict against karseva, the Rajmata came to Ayodhya on behalf of the Sangh Parivar to appease them. Although she did manage to keep her daughter, Vasundhara Raje, in the BJP fold, the latter was not half as serious as her mother about the Ram temple. She was happy vacationing in Jaipur while the mother camped in Ayodhya. Even as the Rajmata was speaking, the war cry from the karseva site broke the quiet of the Ram Katha Kunj. All those who were cordoned off by RSS volunteers and were listening to the leaders stood up. Not that much could be seen from there. A number of them started bolting towards the Ram Deewar and a scuffle with the volunteers followed. Uma Bharti was immediately called upon to try and assuage the crowd, which was on the verge of a rampage. Even her razor-sharp voice got drowned in the din. Dumbfounded, she stood still, her half-finished lecture having cut no ice with the karsevaks. Seshadri, the second in command of the Sangh Parivar, whispered something into the ears of Singhal, who hastened down from the roof and, escorted by a dozen volunteers, walked out to the karseva site. It was too late by then. Singhal tried to brave the deluge of karsevaks by standing on the platform with arms spread out but that did not deter even one among the advancing mob. On top of that, a stream of invective was hurled at him: “Down with politics and hypocrisy”. The arrogant and undisputed leader stood helpless with a blank stare, with his dhoti almost coming off. I ran with the karsevaks past the PAC and CRPF jawans and stood in a corner, after having entered the structure. At least a couple of hundred karsevaks were already atop the dome. A few thousands more were storming in like an army of ants. All of them were armed with sticks, rods or trishuls. At least a hundred were carrying sledgehammers and shovels. Both the dome and the outer walls were under attack. In about ten minutes, half of the outer wall was reduced to a gaping hole. “Charge tear gas,” shouted DB Ray, the SP of Faizabad, and saw with a surprised look the PAC jawans, carrying tear gas shells, ambling away from the structure with an air of quiet resignation. The CRPF followed suit. One of the CRPF jawans whispered a friendly advice, “Out of this place. Quick, if you value your life”. Within moments, brickbats started raining from atop the dome. A CRPF jawan tried to protect us with his cane shield, but even then, a flying brickbat whistled past me and hit one of my fingers. My notebook flew from my hand. I somehow managed to retrieve it and never brought it out again on that fateful day. Sensing more trouble, I put the press card too in the pocket and took out the “Jai Shri Ram” hairband gifted by Swapan the previous night. I tied it around my neck like a bow tie, but soon realised that it was not going to serve as any talisman for me in this hour of crisis. To my horror, I saw a karsevak with a long bamboo pole chasing me. Thankfully, I knew the place well enough to bolt my way into the Sita Rasoi Bhavan. I was not alone there. The house was full of journalists and photographers, some of whom had lost their cameras or film rolls or video cassettes. Ajay Singh,  ’s photographer from the Lucknow bureau, was sitting with a sling around his right hand. He had for company our beloved Thapa from  , who was also injured. I went up to the roof. Debasis Bhattacharya of   and Avijit Lahiri of  were already there and so was Mohan Sahay of  . All three were unscathed, even though a portly lady of the Durga Vahini was targeting Mohan with brickbats in both her hands. What did Mohan do to be singled out as her target could not be readily ascertained. Fortunately, all of us escaped the wrath of the lady unhurt, including Mohan. A short distance from Sita Rasoi Bhavan, Ram Katha Kunj wore a deserted look, as the meeting was already over. LK Advani was sauntering on the roof with his head down and buried in his chest. Deepak Chopra, his personal secretary, and Pramod Mahajan, were standing with their hands on their heads, clearly displaying a sense of resignation. As Swapan approached Mahajan, he wailed, “This is a disaster. If this madness can’t be stopped right now, we are doomed.” In the meanwhile, all hell had broken loose inside the mosque. Spades, shovels and sledgehammers were raining on the dome. The blackish-green outer layer of the wall gave way to an earthen hue. Clouds of dust were billowing up and amidst the dust we saw many karsevaks, tumbling down the dome to the ground, like mangoes from the tree during a nor’wester. As Singhal returned from the war ground, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar got into a huddle in one corner of the roof, cordoned by carbine-toting securitymen from the National Security Guard (NSG) in their unmistakable sky-blue uniform. They would not let anyone reach anywhere close to the leaders. I heard Singhal giving up. “I have failed. Now you guys go and appeal,” he said. Hearing this, Seshadri, ran up to the stage and snatched the microphone from Acharya Dharmendra and started pleading with the masses. Advani and Mahajan went downstairs to listen to the 1pm news bulletin of “Akashvani”, expecting to hear the news of the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government of Uttar Pradesh. A series of pleas began. “We do not have the Mulayam Singh government but our own government in UP. We must cooperate with them and the police. Those who have entered the structure do come out immediately and take part in a peaceful karseva,” appealed Seshadri. All the other leaders, like Sadhvi Rithambara, Uma Bharti, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, more or less repeated the plea in the same vein which went like this: “You have accomplished what you wanted to do. Now, please listen to us and climb down the dome and ensure that no one, especially women, children and the old get hurt.” Only Vinay Katiyar was more aggressive. “You have to listen to us and the sadhus. You have to climb down,” he thundered. As we anticipated, every plea fell on deaf ears. A large section of the crowd that was listening to the leaders at Ram Katha Kunj now got up and marched towards the mosque. The RSS volunteers, too, who were manning the walls from dawn, gave up their vigil. It was more important for them now to carry the injured karsevaks who fell from the tomb, to the first-aid room near the office. I suddenly found Prabhas Jain, chief photographer of  , writhing in pain in a corner of the roof. He was among the many reporters and photographers who dared to be close to the mosque. We brought this up with the Sangh leaders, but no one was in a mood to even listen. Even as scores of the injured were being brought in for treatment, the leaders again went into a huddle in front of the attic. Mahant Avaidyanath, the formidable MP from Gorakhpur, and a leading light of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, was also there. “All India Radio, in its 1pm bulletin, has said that the karseva is going on peacefully,” announced Pramod Mahajan. The news here was that the troublemakers were from Maharashtra and South India, and therefore could not make head or tail of the appeals made in chaste Hindi by the leaders. A volunteer came gasping and said, “Nothing can be heard there. Please go there and use the microphones,” he said. Promptly began a second phase of appeals. The leaders took their turn. Seshadri spoke in all four South Indian languages while Advani raised his voice to rebuke the karsevaks. Ashok Singhal, having regained his poise, thundered, “Can you hear me? This is Ashok Singhal.” The voices echoed on all the walls, but to no avail. After Singhal spoke, to my surprise, I saw a sadhu ranting his appeal in Bengali, my native tongue. “You mean, even Bengalis are there?” I asked him. “Of course, there are. You had doubts?” the sadhu said with pride. So, I told myself, all this worry about the security of the mosque was a hogwash. These people were eminently proud at what the karsevaks were doing. The leaders were speculating the identities of the karsevaks. “The first man atop the dome was from the prime minister’s constituency, Nandial,” said one. “None of them are our men. They have been packed to Ayodhya from Mumbai by Bal Thackeray,” said another. “Thackeray will take all the credit for today’s incident; just check tomorrow’s newspapers,” remarked Mahajan. The Rajmata clearly lost her patience. Grabbing the microphone, she shouted, “Get these people by their necks and pull them down.” Advani, with a binocular, was trying to figure out what exactly was wrong. As he removed those, I asked, “What did you see?” “Nothing except that hundreds are getting hurt,” he said. Till now, the injured were being carried by hand. Now, there were a few ambulances in place, running to and fro with the injured. All of a sudden, we saw that the two tombs that could be seen from the rooftop of Ram Katha Kunj had nobody atop them. Seshadri, who thought that the continuous appeals for three hours have had effect, suggested Advani that he should now congratulate the karsevaks. As Advani was coming down from the dais after his short vote of thanks, he confronted the horrible reality of the day. A frail sadhu had climbed up to the roof with the small Ramlala idol wrapped in his dusty shawl. He was almost in a fit of convulsion, shuddering frenziedly, his body having scratch marks all over. He removed the drape and showed Advani the idol. “Sir, one dome is being destroyed now. We could somehow save the Ramlala,” he gasped. The seasoned politician that Advani was, immediately realised that not only was the situation out of hand, but he was at his wits’ end as to how to reclaim normalcy. Silent and defeated, he climbed down the stairs. We asked for his reaction. “I have no information on the dismissal of the state government, but it seems a matter of time now. The central forces could be here any moment now,” he signed off. A while earlier, we were speculating the same. If in fact the state government did get dismissed and central forces took charge of the mosque to rein in the unruly mob, they could resort to any measure that they deemed fit. The euphoric karsevaks would not take it lying down and a clear consequence would be many deaths, we shuddered to think. As a matter of fact, we had heard from the grapevine around an hour ago that commandos of the Rapid Action Force of the CRPF wanted to take control of the situation and were on their way, but the district magistrate issued an edict to send them back to their barracks. The BJP government of UP was well in its constitutional rights to refuse the CRPF, and expectedly so, but if and when the government got dismissed, Delhi could give marching orders to the central forces. We all knew that the central government had a contingency plan in case of an eventuality like this. At least home minister SR Chavan kept saying so in Parliament for days in the run-up to this day. As such, twenty-eight battalions of CRPF jawans were already deployed at the Faizabad cantonment, notwithstanding vehement protests by Kalyan Singh. Of these, ten battalions comprised the RPF. We were confident that given the situation, the central government would not look by and bring these forces into action. However, when not a single jawan of the central forces appeared in the distant horizon even as the clock struck three, which coincided with the news of the fall of the dome on our right, the leaders started breathing easy. Tapananda Brahmachari, the Bengali sadhu, lectured me. “You live in ivory towers and live the lives of hedonists. How would you know the schemes of God Almighty? The fall of the mosque was inevitable.” Sadhvi Rithambara was brimming with pride, “Whatever happens, happens for good, whether you want it or not.” The leaders quietly accepted that the inevitable had happened and resigned themselves to their fate. Even as they went down to discuss the subsequent moves, the sadhus took centre stage. “Block all roads that lead to Ayodhya. Go and sit on the highways. Make sure that the central forces are kept at bay,” they thundered on the microphone. “Go to the temple and take your Prasad,” was the continuous instruction that Swami Dharmendra kept blaring. Prasad, in this case was not any food, but broken bricks of the Babri Masjid. A long line of disciples carrying bricks was streaming downstairs, even as the two other domes were being demolished. Chandan Mitra, then the associate editor of the  , suggested that we visit the site before it got completely demolished. Mahajan’s personal secretary assured us that he himself would take us down there and there was nothing to worry. Not that there was no cause for fear. As we made our way through the crowd towards the mosque, the choicest of invective greeted us. Nonetheless, we braved them and approached the mosque. It was a grisly sight. The zeal and fervour with which the karsevaks were taking part in the demolition sent a chill down our spines. Those who had no tools to use were scratching away like mad with their fingernails on the domes. A few young men tied a noose around the domes and were trying to pull them down. Chandan and Ruchira Gupta of  , climbed the hillock while the rest of us stayed down. Wherever we moved, a crowd encircled us. I looked in the front and saw an old man trying to come down the hillock. Wearing thick, dirty lenses, the octogenarian was carrying four bricks on his head. As I gaped at him, I saw two young men cradling Ruchira down to where we stood. She was in shock and could hardly speak. “A few karsevaks mistook Madam for a Muslim woman and pounced on her. It could have been a disaster if we were not around,” said one of the men. We chided Ruchira for her uncalled for bravery and came back to the roof of the office. What was relief half an hour ago when we left for the mosque had by now turned into celebrations. The sadhus were gambling on the exact time when the last of the domes would be razed to the ground. Sadhvi Rithambara removed Swami Dharmendra and took charge. “Ek dhakka aur do” (Give one more push), she roared. “Babri Masjid tod do” (demolish Babri Masjid), replied thousands gathered down below. As the last dome tumbled on to the ground at forty-nine minutes past four, all hell broke loose. Sadhvi jumped down from the stage and hugged Uma Bharti. And then, she kept hugging everyone whom she could find in her proximity. All the sadhus were dancing. The only man maintaining equanimity was BJP President Murli Manohar Joshi. “No questions and no answers. Please excuse me today,” the ashen-faced Joshi mumbled. The December afternoon was fast fading into dusk. I looked outside and saw many houses engulfed in flames. Thick black smoke was billowing from everywhere. None of the police officers had any clue of anything. A few know-all karsevaks explained, “The Muslims are torching their own houses so that they can blame it on us.” And yet, there was no inkling of any central intervention. With a smirk on his face, Ashok Singhal returned to the roof to a fresh round of embraces. Everyone was celebrating, including police officers. One of them enquired, “Have you noted the exact time when the mosque got demolished?” and added in the same breath, “You are fortunate. You just saw history being made.” The leader of RSS’s think tank, Sudarshan, who did not take part in the unbridled celebrations, was sitting quietly on a chair nearby. When asked how he would explain what had happened over the past five hours, he replied in fluent Bengali, “Just one thing. Today’s incident proved that history is not made, it happens.” Whether it was a historic moment or a historic blunder is not something I could have dwelt on then. My only concern then was how to get my copy through to my office in Kolkata. Chandan advised me against depending on the Central Telegraph Office of Faizabad and suggested that I should go back to Lucknow. “For all you know, the telephone and telegraph lines may well be snapped just to prevent news from reaching the outside world,” he said, “just as they did after Operation Blue Star in Golden Temple in 1984.” However, nothing like that happened. It was important to get a reaction from Advani before I left the place. The NSG commando who was manning the door, smeared our foreheads with vermilion. He said triumphantly, it was no ordinary stuff, but extracted out of the forehead of the Ramlala idol, which was now in safe custody. We went inside into complete darkness. Two youths, sitting on a wooden platform in a corner room, were trying desperately to tune in to the news from a transistor set. The electricity connections had been snapped at the time when the domes were being pulled down, they informed. They also informed that Advani was in the next room, trying to get in touch with Delhi via telephone, in candlelight, and was all by himself. Advani emerged after a few minutes. For the past eight years that I had known him closely, I had never seen such a nervous Advani before. It seemed that he could not digest the wild celebrations that were happening right above his head. At least, till then.  Has the UP government been sacked?  No, not yet. However, Kalyan Singh telephoned me twice to seek my permission to offer his resignation. I have advised him against it, because if he does, central forces would immediately take over and we will see bloodbath. But by now, he might have resigned. By the time you reach Lucknow, the resignation would most probably have been accepted too.  When do you plan to return to Delhi?  Till this morning, my plan was to take the evening flight from Lucknow. But now I must stay here for a couple of days more. I cannot leave all these people to their destiny.  Could you get in touch with Delhi?  I have been trying for long, but cannot get through.  How would you react to today’s incident?  Unfortunate and regrettable. A few hours later, after returning to Lucknow, we came to know that Advani changed his mind and left Ayodhya in the evening itself. Many days later, on his release from prison, Advani told journalists that he did not regret the demolition of the Babri Masjid. What he regretted was that he could not gauge the mood of the people. I was not surprised at this volte face. After all, the man was in realpolitik and had his stakes in place. As we came out to the last rays of the setting December sun, speculating on whether Chandan’s new Maruti Gypsy car could escape today’s onslaught, Anju Gupta, the demure yet smart police officer with a walkie-talkie in one hand and a stick in another, met us. She drove out the crowd and whispered into Chandan’s ears, “Two photographers have been in hiding since morning in a nearby room. Mind taking them with you?” We would have been glad to do so, but a small car like his would not have been able to accommodate those two, over and above the eight that we already were, Chandan explained. Anju understood and with a shrug said, “Don’t worry. I shall take care of them.” One of the two photographers was Nitin Rai, our colleague from  . Nitin told us later that had it not been for Anju, he could have been killed that day. When the rest of the police force was enjoying the manhandling of reporters and photographers, the only man around was this little woman. When we reached the main road, we found, to our surprise and relief, that Chandan’s car stood just as he had left it there in the morning. Not a scratch or a dent. The car might have escaped the madness, but not so lucky were the local Muslims. Every Muslim house was torched. A few matador vans, auto rickshaws and car tyres were also burning. The karsevaks did exactly as the leaders asked them to. They blocked the roads by felling logs and turning asphalt drums. Around these blockades the karsevaks were dancing like mad men. As we dodged and swerved to make our way through the flames and the maddening sea of humanity, shouts of “Abhi toh yeh sirf jhaanki hain, Mathura, Kashi baaki hain” (This is just the beginning/we will now turn our attention to Mathura and Banaras) filled the evening sky. Curfew was already imposed in Faizabad. As we reached our hotel, Shaan-E-Awadh, we could see for ourselves how scribes had been beaten up by karsevaks. I met Alok Mitra, my photographer colleague. He looked devastated. “Not only was I beaten to a pulp, but lost everything — two cameras and cash worth nine thousand rupees. They even snatched my gold chain,” he cried. I had no words to console him. In the hotel lobby, there were at least fifty scribes from across the globe, all with sunken faces. We learnt that Peter Hynes Lane, of  , had suffered a serious head injury and was taken to the hospital. He was beaten with an iron rod. Former editor of  , SP Singh, stood next to the reception counter. “In my twenty years as a journalist, I have never seen such manhandling of journalists,” he sounded shell-shocked. But Bob Drolin, the   correspondent, who had come to Ayodhya, for the first time, wrote in  , perhaps what was uppermost in every journalist’s mind that day — “Any journalist who was not scared today was stupid”.

Should this alarm us? Not quite. On the contrary, if the  in 2019, it will be a great moment for our democracy. A government that has little to show in terms of concrete achievements, and one that pulled every trick in the book to damage constitutional values does not deserve a second chance. This is not a prediction, but an argument.   It is time to revisit the basic fallacies in the Modi story. The Modi story was one manufactured as much by the electronic media, as by the \"enthusiastic cadre\" of the party working tirelessly on the ground and on social media. It should have been amply clear to anyone who really cared that what Narendra Modi really offered was essentially a xenophobic vision for India, garnished by tokenistic sound bites on development and Mahatma Gandhi. Positioning the debate in 2014 as one between a state-led model of development through entitlements and private sector-led model of fast growth has been laid bare for everyone to see. First of all, there are sectors where the state’s presence is non-negotiable, such as social safety nets, basic health and elementary education. In these sectors, an unwilling state has dragged its feet on both policy-making and implementation, with disastrous results. Meanwhile, the state has expanded its reach to hitherto unparalleled levels through Aadhaar. Individual liberty has been curbed on several fronts. “Minimum government” is a joke. With  , GSPC and  , no one should harbour any illusions any longer of Narendra Modi being above corruption. This should have never been a surprise, given that in the much-hyped \"Gujarat model\", extractive private-enterprises were promoted at the expense of people and the environment. But this, along with the blatant use of social media to promote false propaganda both on the economy and society, belies any claims that one may make of the BJP being a mascot of \"good governance\". In the five years that this government would have been in power, we would have regressed on all fronts while the fruits of this power have been accumulated by the RSS and its affiliates. In the past four years, the economy has been run to the ground, and if things don’t look as bad as they might have, we have only low oil prices to thank. This should worry even those who couldn’t care less about the current establishment’s insidious social and cultural agenda. No wonder then, the scare-mongering has started. India apparently doesn’t deserve a coalition government. Those that argue this are basically claiming that a country as diverse as ours deserves a homogenous single-narrative government. Bizarrely, supporters of the current government are loathe to even acknowledge the successes of the previous BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The prime minister’s own intemperate remarks recently in Parliament have left no one in doubt that the ruling party is desperate. While economic performance tends to be cyclical, the vicious campaign of hate and the normalisation of violence seen in the past four years have no parallel. That this cannot take place without active sanction of the state is a foregone conclusion. What the government has attempted to do is to cultivate a level of plausible deniability around the actions that it silently patronises. Thus, we see to this day, the government accepts no responsibility for the actions of its ideological affiliates, instead terming them as the \"irresponsible fringe\". This remains a handy polarisation tool, one can make an appearance prior to every election of any significance. It is also important ask now - what have we lost in this era of a dominant one-party rule at the Centre? Did we get a \"strong\" government? The hallmark of this government running with an absolute majority in Parliament has been the deification of a single leader. An authoritarian leader may harbour fantasies of being a saviour of 1.3 billion people - but as we have witnessed so far, this is as unreal as it can get. This is also why the prime minister has been heard falling back on state governments and previous central governments to share the blame for big and painful reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax. No democracy needs an almighty leader, and contrary to hype, this has not yielded sound far-sighted economic policy. On the other hand, it has exposed the pitfalls of empowering a narrow power structure that is unwilling to seek out credible counsel. It has also revealed for all to see, the danger of bringing leaders to power whose hunger for political power and self-aggrandisement is all-consuming, even at the expense of core constitutional institutions. Worst of all, the embodiment of communalism in the top leadership (and the wider RSS-sponsored eco-system) has inspired many an act of violence and terrorism. Is this the absolute majority dividend we ought to be grateful for? Would a coalition government have done better? It is obviously hard to tell, but competing pressures from coalition constituents would have put a lid on the brazenness that we have seen playing out in public life. Also, a \"strong government\" is one that secures a wide consensus and represents all sections of the population. The general elections of 2019 would be the time to demand accountability. India deserves better, and we should not let ourselves be distracted by alarmists who are raising the bogey of unsettled coalition politics.","title":"Why everybody feels India is heading back to a coalition government in 2019","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/lok-sabha-elections-2019-coalition-modi-bjp-rss-minimum-government-joke/story/1/22381.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15271},{"author":"Madhuri Danthala","content":"February 15, the birth anniversary of Susan B Anthony, a 19  century women’s rights activist who championed the women’s suffrage movement, is an apt occasion to ruminate over the Women’s Reservation bill. The bill, also known as the Constitution (108th Amendment) Bill, 2008, seeks to ensure that 33 per cent of the seats in the Lok Sabha as well as in state legislative Assemblies are reserved for women. Introduced by the UPA government in 2008, it was passed in the Rajya Sabha, but the Lok Sabha hadn’t voted on it and it therefore lapsed after the Congress-led UPA government lost power in 2014. Had it been enacted, seats would have been reserved on a rotation basis with no seat being reserved more than once in three consecutive general elections. Sadly, there has been no attempt to empower women politically since the bill lapsed. India already has the ignominy of being ranked 148  in terms of representation of women in executive government. We have a mere 11.8 per cent women in the Lok Sabha as against a global average of about 22.8 per cent women in national legislatures (as of June 2016). These figures only indicate the dismal state of women’s empowerment, especially in roles that involve decision-making. Numerous studies have indicated that women’s leadership style tends to be more inclusive and risk averse. This augurs well for any society to attain inclusive and sustainable development. For instance, many scholars are of the view that had there been more women in the top echelons of the corporate field, the global financial crisis of 2008 may have been averted. Giving credence to this view is a report by the UNDP titled, \"Corruption, Accountability and Gender: Understanding the Connections\", implies that having more women representatives could lead to lesser corruption. To understand the correlation between gender parity in politics and development, one must look at the Nordic countries. All the Nordic countries are in the top 10 list of women representatives in Parliament, with Sweden accounting for about 44.7 per cent women in their legislature. This is reflected in their national policies known for being inclusive and gender sensitive. Some of their policies and schemes include, mandatory paternity leave, alongside maternity leave, and post-maternity re-entry programmes. Meanwhile, since 2008, in Norway, it is statutorily mandated that all  . Even in India, there is strong evidence to indicate that where women are involved, there is better development. The United Nations Women, in its website cites research which has revealed that women-led panchayats, had 62 per cent higher drinking water projects than in those led by men. The website also states that a causal relationship was observed in the number of women representatives in local bodies in Norway and better child welfare. It is the prospect of having such provisions in India that should dominate our public discourse and electoral debates. Sadly, our discourse is rife with mudslinging, cheap personal jibes, slander and the like. Rather than debating about the places of worship leaders visit, or the promises of subsidies for pilgrimages, we must be debating about ways to ensure inclusive and sustainable development. Given such a bleak scenario, it is encouraging that at a recent interaction with people, Rahul Gandhi had reiterated what he has been saying for long - that the Congress party under his leadership will ensure more women are brought into the political system. During the interaction, he cited a recent meeting he held with party leaders from a state where a panel of 15 members that discussed women’s empowerment, ironically, had only one woman representative. Instead of indulging in the usual meaningless political jibes, it would be in the best interests of the nation if all parties mulled over this, as the situation is unlikely to be much different from what Rahul Gandhi illustrated. Since all parties agree that women’s empowerment is a matter of paramount importance, they should come together and ensure there is gender parity in their parties. Further, it would be in the best interest of India’s development that all parties put aside their differences and pass the women’s reservation bill. Surely, it cannot be such a difficult thing to do when every party agrees that we need more women in the (legislative) Houses.","title":"Why the women’s reservation bill is important now more than ever","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/womens-reservation-bill-parliament-33-percent-reservation/story/1/22375.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15272},{"author":"Dev Ankur Wadhawan","content":"About 10 months ago, in April 2017, there was a spring in the step of Rajasthan chief minister  .   had turned into a prestige issue and Vasundhara took it upon herself to win the seat and how. She camped and campaigned at the Dholpur Palace for several days, travelling across the constituency, overseeing the campaigning, for which almost all her retinues were pressed into service. The party managed to secure the seat as   beat the Congress by a record margin of over 38,000 votes. The government tom-tommed the victory and claimed it was a reflection of people's confidence in her leadership and BJP's model of governance in the run-up to the Assembly elections in 2018. Cut to February 2018. The result of the three by-elections, including that for Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha constituencies, is out. Vasundhara Raje dispensation would not have expected a worse result. It has been left cutting a sorry figure as in the final year of the government's tenure the voters in these constituencies have overwhelmingly expressed their lack of confidence in her leadership and what her dispensation has managed to achieve or rather not achieve in her four years at the helm. The \"Rani\", facing flak for her domineering style of functioning, has her political career on the line like never before. Speculation about her and some of her trusted lieutenants in the government making way has been rife since the results came. Inaccessibility, disconnect from the masses, unwillingness or inability to address the pressing issues of unemployment, lack of development, price rise, being petty-minded are some of the charges flying thick and fast against her. Murmurs of discontent against her from within the party are no longer just murmurs. They have grown louder and are likely to become shriller as Assembly elections draw nearer this year. Party leaders have been worrying about their fate if the current leadership carries on in the run-up to the polls this year. On a day the chief minister presented the final state Budget of her current term in office, a controversial audio conversation purportedly of a party MLA from Alwar was leaked. A voice believed to be that of the MLA is heard saying he has informed the party that results will be disastrous if the current leadership is not changed. Whether it was the Narendra Modi wave, the anti-incumbency against Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan and the Manmohan Singh dispensation at the Centre or general disenchantment against the Congress during 2013 Assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP's honeymoon period in Rajasthan is well and truly over. This has already set warning bells within the BJP, both at the state and central level. Here are some humbling facts the BJP's top brass has been chewing upon during the last few days after the defeat in the  : The BJP's candidate from Ajmer constituency lost to Congress' candidate by over 84,000 votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by a margin of more than 1.70 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha polls as Sachin Pilot suffered a humiliating defeat. In Alwar, the ruling party's candidate lost by a massive margin of over 1.96 lakh votes. It is a seat the BJP had won by close to 2.84 lakh votes in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In Mandalgarh Assembly by-poll, the Congress candidate defeated the BJP's candidate by over 12,000 votes. This despite the fact that the Congress was in a tight spot in the constituency as a party leader decided to contest as Independent, thereby cutting into the party's votes. On February 12, as \"Rani\" stood inside the Vidhan Sabha, looking at her Budget speech, one which made one promise after another, ranging from farm loan waiver to loan for 50,000 families under Bhairon Singh Shekhawat Antyoday Swarojgar Yojna, much of the old vanity surrounding her seemed to be a thing of the past. Electoral defeats can truly be the most humbling experience for a politician but whether it came too late for Vasundhara Raje or will she still be able to course correct is something only time can tell.","title":"Future looks grim for Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajasthan-by-polls-vasundhare-raje-rajasthan-politics-assembly-elections-sachin-pilot/story/1/22331.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15273},{"author":"Dinesh C Sharma","content":"In the past few weeks, many new policies related to the health sector have been announced, the foremost being the National Health Protection Scheme unveiled in the Budget. Though details of this scheme have not yet been revealed, it will be a government-funded insurance plan to cover hospitalisation costs at secondary and tertiary care levels for poor families. The National Medical Council (NMC) Bill, aimed at bringing in a new medical regulatory authority, is also being reviewed by Parliament. Doctors have taken to the street against this move. Another health-related initiative is the draft of the new pharmaceutical policy. Amidst all this, the Niti Aayog has issued a Health Index that ranks the performance of states in the health sector based on indicators like total fertility rate, maternal mortality rate, status of health personnel, etc, but overlooks crucial indicators like public investment in health. It appears the government and the institutions concerned are treating all these steps in isolation. This amounts to a piecemeal approach to health. We need a comprehensive blueprint for the overhaul of the health sector. Take, for instance, the health protection scheme. In the absence of a policy format and clear objectives, any such \"insurance only\" scheme may not yield desired results and prove to be counter-productive like similar schemes implemented earlier by Union and state governments. Most such schemes have led to a rise in unnecessary procedures and malpractices, and not contributed to better health outcomes. High incidence of costly procedures like stenting, heart surgeries and hysterectomies have been reported in states that funded health insurance. Shifting the government’s responsibility to the private sector without necessary quality and pricing checks would be dangerous. The Clinical Establishment Act — which most states have not implemented — and the NMC Bill, which is pending in the Parliament, are supposed to address these issues. Another interrelated issue is the drug policy. India is fast losing its advantage of cheap drugs, as the domestic drug industry is becoming dependent on China for the supply of bulk drugs for manufacturing even essential medicines because we have systematically neglected public bulk drug firms. At a time when the world is making a gradual shift to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), we are moving towards a private sector cum-insurance-led health system. UHC means providing a minimum set of services for all citizens. For this, countries need to strengthen their health systems and involve private sector wherever necessary. The UHC approach in India is visible in the provision of free ART (Antiretroviral therapy) to people with HIV, free medication to TB patients and the neighbourhood clinic scheme in Delhi. All these are government-led schemes but involve private providers. If UHC is the goal, then it can’t be achieved via insurance alone. We need to strengthen primary care for all. There is no substitute for greater public investment in the health sector.

Most likely not. But apparently, as per the doctor minister, the same may not be true for forest cover, especially the type of forest and forest cover density — important parametres for assessing the health of our forests, the country’s veritable lungs that keep us alive. On Monday, February 12, 2018, the doctor and his team that released the India State of Forest Report 2017, patted their backs for an apparent increase in the forest and tree cover only and largely chose to ignore the weak points as large parts of India lost very dense forests, as was evident from comparison with the previous assessment.   ** The total forest cover as per current assessment is 7,08,273 sqkm, which is 21.54 per cent of the geographic area of the country. ** The tree cover is estimated to be 93,815 sqkm (9.38 million ha), which is 2.85 per cent of the geographical area. ** The total forest and tree cover is 8,02,088 sqkm (80.20 million ha), which is 24.39 per cent of the geographical area. ** There has been an increase of 6,778 sqkm of forest cover at the national level. (After considering the changes during two assessments – 2015 (updated) and 2017). ** Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala have contributed by an increase of 2,141 sqkms, 1,101 sqkm and 1,043 sqkm, respectively. ** There is an increase of 1,243 sqkm in tree cover compared to the 2015 assessment. But a closer look at the  tells us that not all forests are healthy. It sounds more like number jugglery. Even when very dense forest (VDF), that is all land with tree canopy density of 70 per cent and above, increased by 9,525 sqkm from 2015 to 2017, the moderately dense forest (MDF), that is all lands with tree canopy density of 40 per cent and more but less than 70 per cent, decreased by 4,421sqkm. States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have shown decrease in the VDF category. In the MDF category, it is the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Uttarakhand, West Bengal that have shown a negative change. A footnote for Jammu and Kashmir in all cases and for Odisha at another place just add to the gloomy picture. For Jammu and Kashmir, the note reads “includes Jammu and Kashmir area outside LoC that is under illegal occupation of Pakistan and China”. For Odisha, in the table showing “Recorded Forest Areas (RFAs) in States and UTs”, a footnote mentions: “RF (reserved forest) in Odisha includes 9,175 sqkms of proposed RF, PF (protected forest) includes 15,117 sqkms revenue forest/deemed forest and 191 sqkms of private forest.” Bah! So much for quality of forests! As rightly pointed out by this June 2016  titled “Why Defining a 'Forest' in India Is Harder Than It Sounds (And Why That Matters)”, the “Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has been involved in a tussle with the Tribal Affairs Ministry over the question of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) as well as the rights of forest-based communities. The Environment Ministry has been an instrumental part of this battle by reinterpreting the FRA and paving the road to doing away with consent, on multiple levels, from ‘gram sabhas’ (village-level governments) before chopping down India’s traditional forests”. The debate is not settled yet. What is more is minister Harsh Vardhan said, “We are 10th in the list of top forest cover countries. When the world over, there has been a decreasing trend in forest cover, India has witnessed an increase. The other nine countries have a population density of about 150 persons compared to India’s 350 (population density). This is important.” But as is very clear from a   by D Venkateswarlu, an IFS officer from Jharkhand, as part of his assignment for his course at TERI University, each country has its own definitions of what constitutes forests. The European Commission has defined forestland as having at least 20 per cent canopy closure (10 per cent in the Mediterranean forests) and a minimum area of 0.5 ha (1 ha = 0.01Sq. KM); Brazil defines forest as an area of land greater than one hectare, with more than 30 per cent canopy cover and a minimum tree height of five metres; USA’s Forest Service says forest land includes land at least 10 per cent of which is stocked by trees of any size, or land formerly having had such tree cover that will be naturally or artificially regenerated; Canada says forest land is constituted by areas of land where tree canopies cover more than 10 per cent of the total area and the trees, when mature, can grow to a height of more than five metres. China, on the other hand, says forest is “a land having a minimum area 0.67 ha, minimum crown cover of 20 per cent and a minimum tree height of two metres”. Clearly, even when India finds a place amid the first 10 countries, by definition, our forests do not compare qualitatively with other forests. But this fact about what is it that they call a forest does not find mention in the current report. Most worrisome is the situation in high altitudes and northeastern areas: ** The total forest cover in the northeastern region is 171306 sqkm, which is 65.34 per cent of its geographical area in comparison to the national forest cover of 21.54 per cent. ** The current assessment shows a decrease of forest cover to the extent of 630 sqkms in the NE region. ** All altitude zones above 1,000 metres (approximately 3,800 feet) have registered a small decrease in forest cover as against those below 1,000 metres, which show an increase. As many as six states of the northeastern region showed a negative change as compared to 2015 assessment. Arunachal Pradesh (-190), Meghalaya (-116), Mizoram (-531), Nagaland (-450), Sikkim (-9) and Tripura (-164) showed negative change while only Assam and Manipur showed positive changes. When it came to the alarmingly decreasing numbers from the northeastern states, Dr Harsh Vardhan said: “The NE already has 70 per cent of forest cover. We will go into the nitty-gritty and look into the reasons and all positive, corrective measures would be taken.”He also said, “We will treat it as a blessing in disguise and deal with it accordingly.” But then, neither did the minster nor the Forest Survey of India (FSI)  have a clear idea as to what could be the exact reason. Saibal Dasgupta, DG, FSI, said, “Jhoom cultivation can be one of the reasons for the decrease in forest cover in the NE. We will try to increase the livelihood options (for the people of the NE).” When asked if the increasing rate of development projects in the northeast that need cutting down or drowning of forest – such as highways, hydropower projects or industries, could be a reason – the officer, however, said the department did not have segregated data on diverted forest land and land under jhoom cultivation. The picture is especially scary as most of the forests in the hill states of northeast belong to indigenous communities, leading to the obvious question: who is usurping them? Now, to understand what “a small decrease in forest cover” means: (Forest cover in Altitude zones (Area in sqkm)) Clearly, what the report and even the minister termed as “small decrease” for areas above 1,000 metres (3,800 feet and above) is not as small as they want you to believe. The areas above 4,000 feet are the Himalayan ranges that give birth to the majority of our rivers. Forests are vital for the survival of these rivers and the negative decrease (- 217, -193, -76 and -99) for all ranges above 1,000 metres should set the alarm bells ringing in the Himalayan states. They are already bearing the brunt of climate change witnessing decreased snowfall in winters, increased temperatures and drier atmosphere every passing year. Water bodies inside forests and bamboo find a separate mention in the India State of Forests Report 2017 for the first time. Acknowledging that “forests play a vital role in water conservation and improve the water regime in the area”, different state forest departments besides plantation and protection also undertake steps to improve water conservation through different interventions such as building check dams, vegetation barriers, percolation ponds, contour trenches etc under various central and state government schemes. As per the latest assessment based on comparison of satellite images from 2005 and 2015, water bodies inside forest cover have increased by 2,647 sqkm during the last decade. Maharashtra (432 sqkm), Gujarat (428 sqkm) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sqkm) are the top three states that have seen a spike in water bodies within forest areas. Nearly all the states have shown progress in terms of the growth of water bodies, the report said. After recently changing the definition of bamboo as “grass”, compared to the earlier definition of “tree”, the government plans to emphasise more on bamboo’s ecological and economic value. For the first time, bamboo finds mention as a separate chapter of India State of Forest Report 2017 even though it was always an integral part of National Forest Inventory. Instead of regular comparison with 2015 data, as done in other cases, for bamboo, the report compares earlier estimates of 2011. As per those estimates, the total bamboo bearing area in the country has increased by 1.73 million ha. At the national level, the total number of culms has been estimated to be 28,103 million. As compared to the estimate of ISFR 2011, there is an increase about 19 million tonnes equivalent green weight of bamboo observed in the present assessment.","title":"How the quality of India's forests — especially in hills — is suffering","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-forest-report-climate-change-ecology-ministry-of-forests-and-environment/story/1/22336.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15275},{"author":"Arindam De","content":"So Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks that north Indians are \"scum of the earth\"?

Once limited to the north, the drug menace has spread to south Goa too, and intel reports suggest that the drug net is only expanding in the area. Of course, this is not to say that all   are responsible for it, but the fact that   himself has spoken on the issue deserves some attention. But can people like Sardesai blame north Indians for \"all the problems that Goa is facing today\"? What about his \"foreign and high-end tourists\"? As for the minister's other statement that north Indians are gobbling up everything - land and properties - I have this to say. Well, they indeed are because everything is up for grabs. Goa is a beautiful place and whatever is on sale - land and property - will be bought. Domestic tourists are not   land from Goans. No one from Haryana is pushing Goans out of their properties. On the contrary, people are buying properties in Goa at prices usually higher than what the locals would pay.  That an NDA ally deems it right to say that \" \" coming to Goa are ruining the paradise that Goa is, it is not just an insult to the poor but north Indian members of Sardesai's coalition partner, BJP, too.","title":"Why Goa minister Vijai Sardesai thinks poor domestic tourists are ‘scum of the earth’","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/goa-minister-vijai-sardesai-domestic-north-indian-tourists-scum-of-earth-parrikar-drugs/story/1/22295.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15276},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"There was a reason why  , without making any direct reference to actor-turned-Congress leader Divya Spandana's tweet on the prime minister, made his point clear by saying that character assassination of any individual was not right.

It wants to avoid any Congress leader doing a Mani Shankar Aiyar and give Modi the opening he is looking for. In Aiyar, Modi has had a dependable electoral \"ally\". During the Gujarat election campaigning, Modi exploited the dinner Aiyar had hosted for his Pakistani guests and suggested that the Indian guests, which included former prime minister Manmohan Singh, were hatching a conspiracy. When Aiyar called Modi a \"neech aadmi\" to accuse him of playing dirty politics, Modi said it was a casteist slur and alleged Aiyar had gone to Pakistan to offer \"supari\" for him. In 2014, Aiyar had inadvertently helped the BJP to go on the offensive when he smugly offered space for Modi to set up a tea stall. Modi went to town, interpreting it as an insult to his past vocation, and the arrogance of the party [Congress] in power. Ever since he took charge of the party, Rahul Gandhi has maintained that he and his party will follow a certain propriety even when mud is thrown at rivals in the heat and dust of elections. There is no booklet available that lists out the dos and don'ts, but it seems in the Congress book, everyone but Modi is fair game. So the name of Arun Jaitley can be changed by Gandhi to  . The BJP has returned the compliment by branding the Siddaramaiah government a 10 per cent government, insinuating that it is corrupt. This reluctance to attack the PM at a personal level is more to do with fear factor than real respect. Political strategists point out the example of Arvind Kejriwal who at one point in time, would not tire of dragging Modi into just about every issue concerning Delhi. So much so that it started to look like the Delhi CM suffered from a Modi-phobia. And the more he attacked the PM, his own stature started diminishing with even those who had voted him to power in Delhi, asking why he does not let his work do the talking instead of venting his spleen through Twitter everyday. Which is why it will be interesting to note how the Siddaramaiah versus Modi battle plays out on Twitter. For the past one week, the Karnataka CM has taken on the PM, countering his allegations with facts. This has BS Yeddyurappa, the BJP's chief ministerial face, feeling left out as he expected Karnataka to be a Yeddyurappa versus Siddaramaiah fight. On numerous occasions, he has tried to draw the CM into an argument by responding to his tweets. Siddaramaiah's effort to target Modi directly runs the risk of going wrong for two reasons. One, people like to see a battle between equals, and it would seem that Siddaramaiah is punching above his weight by taking on the PM. Two, it will take just one slip by Siddaramaiah for his rivals, including Modi, to use that to counter attack him. Similarly, the approach of actor Prakash Raj is fraught with risk. For the past many months, Raj has been speaking out against both Modi and Amit Shah, accusing them of being anti-Hindu. If Raj campaigns against right-wing hardline elements in Karnataka, as he may do, it will obviously be seen as helping the Congress. It is a double-edged sword as any kind of vitriol that is seen as a personal attack, could boomerang. It is here that the Nitish Kumar strategy is spoken of as a better template. He made the Bihar 2015 election as a \"Bihari versus Bahari\" duel, positioning himself and Lalu Yadav as sons of the soil versus the two outsiders in Modi and Amit Shah. So Siddaramaiah's emphasis on Kannadiga pride as a counterpoint to the nationalistic approach of BJP, would be a better electoral ploy. Karnataka has always been seen by the BJP as its gateway to south India. The party made a mess of the chance it got in 2008, with Yeddyurappa who was the CM, getting embroiled in corruption cases. It would now want to make amends. With Karnataka being the largest state under Congress control, the stakes are high for both the parties. Enough reason for politicians to stoop as low.  ","title":"In Karnataka, no one dares to upset Modi, not even Congress","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-congress-rahul-gandhi-karnataka-siddaramaiah-arun-jaitley-divya-spandana/story/1/22296.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15277},{"author":"Omair Ahmad","content":"The recent Gujarat state elections were marked by the BJP and its supporters campaigning against Muslims, and the Congress  . The one candidate who did speak on this issue was  , an independent candidate supported by the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, fighting for a seat reserved for Dalits. Weeks ago in  , Uttar Pradesh, as rioters disrupted a Republic Day hoisting of flags by Muslims and called them “Pakistanis”, the one legislator to raise the issue as one of fundamental rights was  , representing a regional party with one MP in the Lok Sabha. His ability to influence national politics is next to non-existent. The marginalisation of Muslims in national politics is almost complete. Their position is that of the eternal stuffed toy, to be vilified at will, with almost no legislator willing to speak of the fundamental right to life of more than 170 million people in the world’s largest democracy. The virtual political disenfranchisement of Muslims in India is a corrosive problem, with potentially catastrophic impact on Indian democracy, but there are no Muslim political leaders of note to address this. At such points, there is the usual lament about the fact that Muslims have not been able to produce a leader of the calibre of Abdul Kalam Azad, India’s first education minister, and who was elected to the post of President of the Indian National Congress, on par with Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. What these lamentations ignore is that Azad was a politician of pre-Partition India. The loss of the large Muslim population in Punjab and East Pakistan/Bangladesh meant that the national base of Muslim politics was vastly reduced after Independence. The Muslims who would have voted for the Congress and a Congress Muslim – bear in mind that in the 1937 elections, the Congress won 25 of the 59 seats reserved for Muslims, including all 15 from the then-North West Frontier Province – were gone (the Unionist Party in undivided Punjab won 101 seats, almost on par with the Muslim League total of 106, and its base was largely the part now in Pakistan). They had to, and still do, navigate politics in different states. With the loss of large mass bases, Partition meant that there was literally no state in the Indian Union where Muslims accounted for a majority, apart from Jammu & Kashmir. Given that J&K accounts for one per cent of the Indian population, and the role of Chief Minister of J&K has basically been reduced to asking, “How high?” when the Centre says, “Jump”, its impact on national politics is hardly worth considering. In the rest of India, the chance of a Muslim party dominating a state, or even playing a major part in its politics, was doomed from the start. In the first-past-the-post elections that we have (we can see from Germany or South Africa that proportional representation better manages diverse polities), a candidate usually needs between 30 to 35 percent of the vote-share to win. There are almost no constituencies in India where Muslims have that much of the population, even if they were not factionalised among themselves to begin with. Lastly is the issue of finance. After Partition, not only did Muslims no longer have a mass base, they lost many of their most prosperous community members, with only a very few of the elite remaining. These were deeply disconnected from the conditions and concerns of, and often in exploitative relationships with, their poorer brethren. Today, if Muslims are found on the national landscape, their wealth is largely tied to the arts – and the  like Aamir Khan or Shah Rukh Khan when they question anti-Muslim rhetoric or actions highlight exactly how precarious their position is, despite their fame or success. Given these conditions, post-Independence Muslim politics has been dominated by two types of Muslims, the “sarkari mussalman”, who kowtowed to the ruling dispensation in return for a share of the spoils, or the “unlettered mullah”, who spoke of Muslim concerns as religious difference, as distinct from the national agenda. In both these cases, what these politicians offered to the ruling parties is a vote base that they could energise, whether by patronage or polarisation. Neither offered an investment in the principles of the Constitution, in fundamental rights, in the life of the nation, in issues of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, in deepening democracy, and the importance of federalism and the identity of regions. Why would they? They were in the business of being doorkeepers, and if doors were easily accessible to all, their own value would plummet. This corrosive failure is most clearly seen in Kashmir, where Muslims have largely adopted a “nationalistic” line that is deeply at odds with Constitutional values. The cost of this has been that a political issue has been handled as a communal issue. Today, as many of the same features of misgovernance in Kashmir find their way into the national agenda, Kashmiris snarkily comment to Muslims – who ignored these very same issues of the degradation of democracy, the gutting of institutions, of impunity and murder – that they have got what they deserved. And frankly, it is true. Too busy fighting little turf wars to protect their “privilege” to serve the rulers, or in highlighting their difference from mainstream debates, Muslims have found themselves completely on the sidelines of democratic debate. In many ways, the failure of the elite is far greater than that of the mullahs. Most of the community members who attend madarsas, or are trained as ulema, come from under-privileged families who have few options, and have not had the depth and breadth of education or experience to engage well with politics. The elite do not have this excuse. If there is hope for Muslim leadership, it lies in the fact that the prosperity of the nation as a whole has allowed a wider educated middle class to emerge. While the Sachar Commission report highlighted the woeful socio-economic condition of Muslims, what should not be forgotten is that Indians as a whole are far better educated and living in better conditions than at the time of Independence. As part of that progress, Muslims have benefited too, if not as much as others. This rising base of capable young men and women are the ones in the frontlines of the battle for Constitutional values, it is on their shoulders that the future of Muslim politics in India rests, and the future of India as a whole, because there is no good future with such a large part of the body politic going unrepresented.","title":"The failure, and hope, of Muslim politics in India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/muslims-in-india-communal-politics-bjp-hindutva-kasganj-asaduddin-owaisi/story/1/22300.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15278},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"Our history and mythology are full of women punished for laughing. Laughing in an open court at the king’s follies, when everyone would rather please the emperor, is blasphemy, a written and/or unwritten code. Laughing at untruths peddled as fierce rhetoric, combatting willful instrumentalisation of historical ignorance to farcical and fearful ends is a heroine’s job. Standing out is a heroine’s way of being, laughing at the powerful whom no one dare displease is what she does for a living. , Congress MP, 63, laughed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday (February 7), when he was delivering a speech in Rajya Sabha. He was going on and on about how Gandhi wanted a “Congress-mukt Bharat”, just like hours back in Lok Sabha he had claimed without Sardar Patel, Kashmir wouldn’t have been divided. These historical distortions, fraudulent claims, these lies, that PM Modi utters in Parliament, the highest legislating body in the country, in the garb of “roaring”, or “declaring war on the Nehru-Gandhis”, as much of the media would have us believe, are enough to drive anyone with a secondary school sense of history into peals of hysterical laughter. On Twitter, historian Srinath Raghavan tweeted out the obvious “facts” of 1947 and the case of Kashmir, and many shared his words with a hearty laugh at the PM. Chowdhury laughed inside Parliament, in Rajya Sabha. While she was laughing, she was breaching “etiquette”, written down rules of good conduct, usually reserved to maintain order in the House, but also to preserve equality among the representatives. Yet, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu interrupted PM Modi to chastise Chowdhury, saying he needed to report such “loose talk and unruly behaviour”. Naidu didn’t interrupt Modi once, or contradict his claims of counterfeit, his downright disgusting humiliation of the most luminous star in India’s historical firmament, Jawaharlal Nehru. Naidu interrupted to reprimand Chowdhury instead, give her sermons of discipline, egging on PM Modi in his act of hysterical fraudulence.  It was then PM Modi, in a matter of pointed rebuke, said the chairman mustn’t say anything to Chowdhury, because it was after a long time since Ramanad Sagar's   serial was aired, did they get to hear such a laughter. MoS home Kiren Rijiju tweeted out the clip, describing Chowdhury’s laugh as “vexatious”. Some headlines called it  , others reported how BJP national president and Rajya Sabha MP Amit Shah burst out laughing after Modi’s rebuke, along with the men and a few women in the upper House, laughing along, because they dare not laugh at. \r\n \r\n There are many Ramayanas, but in the version most pleasing to the north Indian patriarchy that has a fetish for the warrior king Rama, the laughing women are not the female protagonists. Surpanakha, Ravana’s sister, supposedly laughed at Lakshmana, and had her nose cut off. Manthara, the hunchback aide to Kaikeyi, the middle queen, the muddle queen, of Dasharatha, perhaps laughed while whispering the lure of power and the throne into the queen’s ears. Laughing in Ramayana is akin to evil; laughing is dangerous because it liberates women from the rib cage of patriarchy. In turn, patriarchy, its scribes, retellers, turn them into deformed minds and bodies, monstrosities stinking of deeply racial stereotypes, making them responsible for what’s ultimately a challenge to the inevitability of primogeniture - eldest male succession - and male control of everything around. In feminist rereadings of Ramayana,  , as she sings the blues, controls her womb, makes decisions. In male fantasy version of Ramayana, Sita immolates herself for the sake of her husband, to prove her chastity. However, in the superior epic that’s Mahabharata, the female protagonist Draupadi laughs a lot, menstruates, has sex with five men at least. Draupadi laughs at Duryodhana when he falls into a pool thinking it’s a crystal floor in a palace at Indraprastha. Duryodhana takes his revenge by having his younger brother try disrobe Draupadi in the court of king Dhritarashtra, before a manel of royal loyalists, some tied to the throne, some to sycophancy, turning away their gaze from the injustice. The Kuru clan gets decimated in a “just war”, desired by the Kurus themselves. Laughing women appear in Greco-Roman myths. Helen (before she was of Troy) had laughed at the uncouth Menelaus, whom she was wedded to. She eloped with Paris, and Homer made her the peg on which to hang the male imperial and sexual insecurities. In  , French feminist Helene Cixous wrote how the laughing woman is always the outlier, the biggest challenger to patriarchy’s self-replicating tropes. So, she must be turned into a demon, a gorgon. The laughing woman is seen as a castrator, an antithesis to the power of the male pen and the penis. Laughing women are punished by gods everywhere, turned into stone, raped, turned into animals, cast away, chained, imprisoned, rebuked, called a witch, bitch. Laughing women’s agency makes the gods shiver, so they take to collective punishment. Even Milan Kundera, the great Czech writer of  - weaponised the male laughter at the powerful as worthy of his writerly attention, critical engagement. Female laughter deflated even men like Kundera; so characters like Zedna laugh but also complain, nag. Female solitude was erotic - but female laughter too challenging, too uncomfortable, in fact “emasculating”. Men laughing at men, or men becoming victims of the political consequences of their unscheduled laughter, men refusing to join in the chorus of orchestrated laughter, the theatre of cheerfulness at a totalitarian time - they happen to people Kundera’s universe of laughing men in a laughable world. But women are either props of that laughable world, or outliers incinerating the self-worth of these leading men, prompting the writer to scavenge the myths in search of a bogus salvation. Renuka Chowdhury laughed at Narendra Modi, in Parliament. It’s the laughter of powerless at the powerful, the laughter that momentarily inverts the order, as it were. Chowdhury’s laughter resembled that of Baubo, the Greek goddess of mirth and laughter, whose liberation is bundled with her wisdom, for she knows she must laugh at the powerful, and heal the powerless. And that solitary laughter at power is incredibly more powerful than a court laughing at its single female challenger, the harbinger of the imminent fall.      ","title":"Why Renuka Chowdhury’s laughter is more powerful than that of Modi coterie","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/renuka-chowdhury-laughter-modi-parliament-patriarchy-bjp-ramayana-mahabharata-draupadi/story/1/22262.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15279},{"author":"Geeta Mohan","content":"The  administration, in what is being termed as \"bold\" and a \"historic\" visit, has decided to de-hyphenate   and engage with both nations separately. While many believed that the Indian prime minister and his government will shift course, after the BJP came to power in 2014, from the traditional line that India always took on Palestine, the decision to vote in favour of Palestine at the UN and now the visit has infused hope and confidence in Ramallah. Not only has a strong foreign policy decision been made, but also the highest level of the Indian leadership has “belled the cat”, taking on the daunting task of visiting Ramallah. \r\n \r\n For many years, India’s visit to Israel and Palestine at the highest level were given a miss keeping in mind the \"sensitivities\" involved. And then in 2017, breaking away from past trappings, Prime Minister Modi took the bold decision to visit Israel - visit Israel alone without touching Palestine, which made many question India’s stand. Have we given up on Palestine? Is this a shift in India’s foreign policy? These were the common refrain. Clearly not. Certain sections in India hailed the Israel visit as one where India has charted out a new course for itself without pandering to the “appeasement” brigade and reaching out to Muslims... Until reality set in. India understood the importance of balancing ties and accounting for the important role Arab nations play in India’s economic growth story which led to the announcement of his “stand-alone” visit to Palestine. But many still ask, will Modi stay the course on India’s support to the Palestinian cause? India’s defence and security ties with Israel is growing exponentially. And the strong Jewish lobby certainly can help India’s case against Pakistan in the United States. But then again, Israel also has great relations with China. A nation that sides with Pakistan even if all odds are against the latter. Either Israel can be an influencer or despite strong Sino-Israel ties, China can continue to support Pakistan. The Arab world, on the other hand, is a stabilising factor providing jobs and is a major source of energy for India. But here again, terrorism and security matters sometimes adversely impact India’s interests. If India is trying to be transactional in its dealings with the nations of this region, then the decision to stay the course works in India’s favour. There is a strong opinion growing in Palestine that with the disruptive role that the US has played on the issue of Jerusalem and with the closeness that Modi shares with Benjamin Netanyahu, India could be an influencer rather than a disruptor. But both Israel and Palestine also realise that the Modi era is finite. Hence, what is important is to ensure a continuum in the foreign policy rather than a hasty shift that could spoil India’s equilibrium in the region. Interestingly, both Israel and Palestine are calling the outreach a “love affair”, neither unable to fathom why is Modi giving the time of day to the other.","title":"National interest over ideology, but will India stay the course on Palestine?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-palestine-visit-gulf-israel-mahmoud-abbas-ramallah-benjamin-netanyahu/story/1/22269.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15280},{"author":"Nikhil Wagle","content":"There is a new spring in Sharad Pawar’s step ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief has already managed to cobble up an informal alliance, and we saw a glimpse of that at the January 26 \" \" march in Mumbai. Even though the rally was organised by MP Raju Shetty and MLC Jitendra Awhad, Pawar was the one pulling the strings. He personally made calls to the main Opposition leaders, ensuring the presence of the likes of Sharad Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Omar Abdullah, D Raja and so on. More importantly, the senior state Congress leaders too were present at the rally. If there is any chance of an Opposition unity, Pawar knows it isn’t possible without the backing of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. He was in touch with them from the beginning. On top of that, he even tweeted saying that the next moves would be decided after consulting Rahul Gandhi. Later, the Opposition leaders held two more meetings, one at Sonia Gandhi’s residence, and the other at Pawar’s. \r\n \r\n Known for his astuteness, Pawar’s strategy should be seen in the context of the dramatically changing political climate in India. According to an IndiaSpend analysis published recently, the BJP could be down to   from its unprecedented 282 seats. In the last four years, 15 states have witnessed Assembly elections. Those 15 states had fetched the BJP 191 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. But considering the downward popularity of the BJP in those states, along with trends in Gujarat Assembly elections and Rajasthan by-polls, the ruling party looks set to lose considerable vote share in 2019. In such a scenario, the non-BJP and non-Congress parties can make a considerable difference. If the BJP is restricted at around 225, and the Congress at 125, the remaining 193 seats could be crucial, and that is where Pawar comes into play. He enjoys excellent rapport with parties across the board, irrespective of their ideologies. And with BJP’s current allies such as the Shiv Sena, the TDP and the Akali Dal upset with Modi, Pawar could easily exploit the situation. Moreover, more than 100 BJP’s MPs are Congress turncoats. Smelling an opportunity, Pawar seems to have rekindled his dream of becoming the prime minister. He has been trying his luck since Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, however, only in vain. In 1991, Pawar took on PV Narasimha Rao in the leadership race. I was witness to these happenings in New Delhi. Pawar’s Man Friday, Suresh Kalmadi, tried his best even as  his industrialist friends extended their full support. But Narasimha Rao was equally shrewd and knew the Congress party better than Pawar. He defeated Pawar, made him defence minister and sent him back to Maharashtra after the 1993 blasts. Since then Pawar’s close associates have tried their best to revive his dream during each Parliament election except the 2014 battle. The Modi wave had seemingly demolished Pawar’s dream even before the race began. Pawar admitted this publicly several times. But now in a changed political scenario, the NCP veteran has become active once again. Of course, if you ask him that, he would deny it immediately. However, there are several impediments in the way of his PM dream. The biggest of them is his own credibility crisis, not just in Maharashtra, but across the country. Even Opposition leaders around him concede the fact that he cannot be trusted. Not too long ago, his party unconditionally supported the   government in Maharashtra from outside in 2014 and kept the minority BJP government afloat after the Assembly polls threw up a hung verdict. Also, his friendship with Modi is looked at with suspicion. And even though his relationship with Rahul Gandhi has improved in the recent past, to what extent will the Congress president repose his trust in Pawar is anybody’s guess. Further, how would the big Opposition leaders with even bigger egos work with each other? The TMC is currently the third-largest party in Lok Sabha. Mamata Banerjee’s hold over West Bengal is comfortable. Even though she sent her representative to Mumbai for the rally, she later said it is just a formality. Why would Banerjee accept Pawar’s leadership, who doesn’t even have 15 MPs? Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav will also ask the same question. Within a week of the Pawar-led march, Akhilesh Yadav conducted his own rally in Mumbai. Moreover, Akhilesh and Mayawati haven’t joined hands either. Even in Mumbai, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh chief and Dalit stalwart Prakash Ambedkar is not ready to repose his trust in Pawar. On top of that, leaders from the southern states remain unpredictable as ever. The ego battles between regional parties are historic and the country has seen it closely in 1977, 1989 and 1996. There is another possibility that cannot be neglected. If the BJP’s seats go down to a level where Modi cannot hold the allies together,   within the NDA could emerge as a preferred candidate to lead the country. The late PA Sangma’s son and NPP chief Conrad Sangma, has recently said that in as many words. (For the uninitiated, the National People's Party was formed by the veteran PA Sangma after he left the NCP, which he, along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar, founded in 1999 following their expulsion from the Congress for opposing Sonia Gandhi's leadership over her foreign origin. Pawar and Sangma later fell out after the NCP refused to back Sangma's candidature for President of India in 2012. An ally of the NDA, the NPP's influence is mostly concentrated in Meghalaya, which is going to Assembly polls on February 27.) Notwithstanding the ever-changing equations, Pawar in all likelihood will continue to play an important role.

Sheikh is the man behind the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul case in which a huge cache of arms and explosives to target political leaders were procured. Leads from Sheikh’s sustained interrogation have already helped the National Investigation Agency (NIA) make two vital arrests from Bihar’s Gopalganj district. The latest arrests were on Thursday when the premier investigating agency picked a suspected operative of terrorist outfit LeT from Gopalganj district for his alleged involvement in creating a sleeper cell of the banned organisation in Bihar. An NIA team from Delhi picked up one Mahfooz Alam from his house at Khajurbanni locality of Gopalganj, around 145km northwest of capital city Patna. Alam has been taken to Delhi for interrogation. Incidentally, this was NIA’s second arrest the same district in last two months after the agency picked one Bedar Bakht alias Dhannu Raja on December 1.  Both Alam and Bakht have been found to have assisted Sheikh, and provided logistic, financial support and shelter to him. The two also collected funds for Sheikh through international money transfer services. All these arrests have revealed an uncanny terror link to Gopalganj district, as Sheikh too had spent two years in this district from early 2015 to March 2017. These arrests have raised a flag about Bihar, as the intelligence agencies are said to be assessing what drew the terrorists to Gopalganj district. While he was in Gopalganj, Sheikh ran a private coaching institute in the Bihar town, where he indoctrinated youths and built sleeper cells of the banned terror outfit. Prior to making Bihar his base, Sheikh was arrested in West Bengal in 2007 while infiltrating into India from Bangladesh with two Pakistanis and one Kashmiri. He escaped from judicial custody in 2014 while being taken to Mumbai to the MCOCA court there. Investigations have revealed that while government agencies frantically searched for him after his escape, Sheikh was relatively safe, teaching spoken English at his Gopalganj-based coaching institute called Smart Learner. Sheikh, considered close to 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Abu Jindal, had obtained Aadhaar card, passport and PAN (Permanent Account Number) under a pseudonym of Suhail Khan alias Mohammad Ali. Incidentally, Nayeem’s story bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Md Tauseef Khan, the 30- something mastermind of the July 2008 Ahmedabad blast, who was arrested from Bihar’s Gaya district in September last year. Tauseef too had taken shelter in Bihar’s Gaya district and was working as a school-teacher after triggering explosions in Ahmedabad, which killed 56 people and injured over 200. Nayeem is also believed to have obtained fake certificates of secondary school to get his passport issued from the Patna regional passport office. The NIA is also questioning a number of district-level officials to find out how Abdul Nayeem Sheikh, a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, succeeded in getting a domicile certificate, driving license, matriculation certificate and passport issued in the assumed name of Suhail Khan. Incidentally, Bihar has its old connections with terror outfits. Indian Mujahideen co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and another operative, Abdul Karim Tunda, were arrested from the Raxaul border in East Champaran district.

Let’s do the electoral math by placing the country into four clusters: 1) north and west; 2) south; 3) east; and 4) Northeast and union territories.  This comprises 12 states (Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh). Together they offer 259 seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won 205 seats out of its overall tally of 282 seats from this 12-state, 259-seat cluster. This is therefore the make-or-break cluster for the BJP. In 2019 though, it can realistically expect to win only around 150 seats from these 12 key north-western states. That’s a fall of 55 seats over 2014 due to strong anti-incumbency, the Congress’ resurgence and the   across the region. Can it make up this large decline in the other zones?  The five are unlikely to provide a cushion. The BJP won 21 out of 129 available seats in the south in 2014. Karnataka provided 17 of these. Again realistically, the BJP is unlikely to increase its tally significantly in 2019. Kerala may offer the odd extra seat. Karnataka could even slip a little, leaving the BJP with around 20 seats in the south. Together in the first two clusters, the BJP’s tally could therefore total around 170.  The four key eastern states of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand could prove crucial for the BJP. In 2014, the BJP won 37 seats in these four states from 117 seats on offer. In 2019, it will rely heavily on seat-sharing with ally JD(U) to sweep Bihar. Odisha promises a rich harvest too with dissent at the top of Naveen Patnaik’s BJD giving the BJP an opening. West Bengal remains a distant prospect though the BJP is likely to make inroads as the Left continues to lose traction. Meanwhile, with Jharkhand, where the BJP won 12 out of 14 seats in 2014, still a safe bet, the BJP could increase its tally in the 117-seat east cluster from 37 seats in 2014 to around 45 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP’s overall tally in the first three clusters rises to around 215 seats.  The   has been a special focus for the BJP. In 2014, it won just eight out of 25 seats in the seven northeastern states and Sikkim - seven of them from Assam. The BJP-backed North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) has changed the situation dramatically. The party can expect to raise its tally to around 14 seats in 2019. The seven union territories (UTs), including Delhi NCT, contributed 11 out of 13 available seats to the BJP in 2014. That total is unlikely to change much, though Delhi could swing partially towards the Congress, giving the BJP around 25 out of 38 seats on offer in the fourth cluster. Thus, the four clusters, in a best-case scenario, are likely to provide the BJP with 240 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election (150+20+45+25). Caveat: a Mayawati-Mulayam-Congress mahagathbandhan, however unlikely, could significantly reduce the BJP’s tally in Uttar Pradesh, cutting its Lok Sabha numbers to the low 220s. Unpredictable events such as a positive verdict by the Supreme Court in the Ram Mandir case and escalation of a conflict with Pakistan could in turn change the electoral math in favour of the BJP. Clearly, the BJP with 220-240 seats will not be able to form a government without the support of NDA allies. The Shiv Sena, TDP, LJP, SAD and others have varying degrees of problems with the BJP. To form a stable NDA coalition, the BJP would need at least 50 seats from its allies, taking the alliance’s tally to around 270-290. With the JD(U), but without the Shiv Sena, even that may prove difficult. The Rajinikanth factor in Tamil Nadu though could play a decisive role if he allies with the NDA, making Shiv Sena support redundant. Now turn to the Congress. To win power, Rahul Gandhi will have to rely heavily on old and new UPA allies. Across our four clusters, the Congress will be lucky to win 85-90 seats overall. To be a credible challenger to form a UPA 3 government, the Congress will need the following eleven key allies: TMC, the Left, DMK, SP, RJD, BSP, JD(S), AIMIM, NC, NCP and TRS. Defections from the NDA’s disgruntled allies would be welcome. Again, taking a best-case scenario, despite the unlikely prospect of the BSP and SP as well as the Left and TMC cohabiting in UPA 3, the 11 key allies together with smaller Congress-leaning parties are unlikely to garner more than 120 seats. Even if the Congress doubles its own tally to 90 seats, a putative UPA 3 would have only 210 Lok Sabha seats in all (90+120) - far short of a working majority. The way forward for the Congress therefore is to win at least 150 seats on its own as it did in 2004. Then only will it be able to cobble together a workable UPA 3 coalition in 2019 with over 270 seats (150 Congress plus 120 allies). In 2004, the Left with 60 seats supported the 145-seat Congress from outside. Other UPA 1 allies made up the numbers. In 2019, though relatively weakened, the BJP will still win far more than the 138 seats it won in 2004. At our estimate of 220-240 seats, the BJP can effectively thwart a potential UPA 3 - unless the Congress nearly quadruples its 2014 tally of 44 to well over 150. There just aren’t enough UPA allies to make up the slack as there were in 2004 with the Left’s 60 seats plumetting in 2014 to just nine. In 2019, the largest UPA ally will be the TMC with 30-odd seats. For the BJP, the message is clear. Five consecutive mediocre Budgets have alienated the middle class. They count for little electorally, but have a disproportionate influence on the political narrative. The BJP’s policies over the past 45 months have been a mixed bag: in sum, it has failed to deliver maximum governance and minimum government. It has less than a year to reverse the slide. The Lok Sabha election may well be advanced to December 2018 along with the key state polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in order to mask strong anti-incumbency. The BJP though does have one trump card: a still-anaemic Congress. But it can’t rely on that forever. To win re-election, the BJP will have to perform. Or perish.","title":"Why Modi faces rocky road to 272 in 2019 Lok Sabha elections","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-2019-lok-sabha-elections-bjp-nda-allies-disgruntled-272-mark/story/1/22234.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15283},{"author":"Harsh V Pant","content":"Crisis in the Maldives escalated this week after President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of Emergency and asked the military troops to arrest two top judges and detain former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the Opposition. Last week the nation’s Supreme Court had ordered the release of nine imprisoned Opposition politicians on the ground that their trials were politically motivated and flawed. The government refused to implement the ruling which led to widespread demonstrations in Male and clashes between the police and protesters. Calling President Yameen’s announcement “unconstitutional and illegal”, exiled former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed, the country’s first democratically-elected leader, has urged India to “act swiftly” to resolve the crisis. In some ways, Yameen’s actions are understandable as his options after the Supreme Court ruling were limited. The court verdict not only paves the way for Nasheed to return from his exile in Colombo and run for the presidency this year but also makes Yameen’s impeachment potentially plausible. Yameen must be calculating that with help of friends of like China, he would be able to ride over the crisis that would emerge with his declaration of Emergency. The alacrity with which the Maldives embraced China seems to have caught India off guard. But New Delhi’s engagement with Male has been hesitant of late and China has made the most of it. During Yameen’s China visit last year, the two nations signed 12 pacts, including a free trade agreement. Yameen also fully endorsed China’s ambitious Maritime Silk Road initiative. President Xi Jinping declared that “China deems the Maldives as an important partner” in this initiative and Yameen repaid the favour by claiming that the Maldives viewed China “among (its) closest friends” and that “the Belt and Road Initiative has greatly helped the development of many small and medium countries”. At a time when China’s belt and road initiative is beginning to attract scrutiny around the world, with even erstwhile supporters calling for a reassessment, such an endorsement is much sought after by Beijing. The Maldives became the second country in South Asia, after Pakistan, to enter into a free trade agreement with China. The Yameen government pushed the FTA through the nation’s Parliament, the Majlis, stealthily, with the Opposition not attending the parliamentary session. The principal Opposition party, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that it was “deeply concerned over sudden and rushed Free Trade Agreement with China, without any disclosure of details to the public or to the MPs”. The concerns of the Opposition centre around a possible increase in the trade deficit, already tilted in favour of China, and the strategic direction of the country. The MDP has argued that it is worried “that further entrenchment of the country into a Chinese debt trap will result in additional stress on strategic national assets and increasing instability in the Indian Ocean region”. But that is where Yameen wants to take his country, it seems. On the one hand, he has been flirting with Islamist extremism and on the other, he wants to use closer ties with China to shield his government from global criticism. After the first-ever visit by a Chinese President to the Maldives in 2014, it officially became a part of the \"21st-century Maritime Silk Road.\" China quickly expanded its economic profile in the Maldives by building mega infrastructure projects, including the development of Hulhule island and a bridge connecting it to Male as well as the country’s main international airport. A constitutional amendment allowing foreign ownership of freehold land was passed in 2015, which can potentially enhance Chinese military presence in the island nation. Already, Chinese naval ships have become regular visitors to Male. During his 2016 visit to Delhi, Yameen had said his country pursues an “India first” foreign policy, describing it as the Maldives’s most important friend. But that was just after India had shielded the Yameen government from punitive action by the Commonwealth’s human rights and democracy oversight body. New Delhi’s recent policy of engaging with the Maldivian Opposition, especially the former President, Mohammad Nasheed, may be causing heartburn in Male and so the outreach to China has intensified. The Maldives remains the only country in South Asia which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is yet to visit. There were many in India who had been critical of the Modi government’s light touch approach vis-à-vis Yameen over the last few years as he systematically worked at destroying the foundations of democracy in his country. But New Delhi had other interests to preserve in the archipelago nation. Now the moment of reckoning has come for both New Delhi and Yameen. India’s suggestion that the Supreme Court’s ruling should be promptly implemented was clearly given a short shrift by Yameen. New Delhi will have to intervene cautiously. A coordinated response with other like-minded regional and extra-regional players will be the first step. But like in the past, New Delhi should not be shy of using coercive diplomacy if only to underscore that ignoring India’s warnings comes at a price. The logic of geography dictates that India’s role will be critical in determining the trajectory of political developments in the Maldives.

So do nations. Nothing manifested that better than the congregation of the super rich, their global affluence evident as their private jets swooped into the Swiss Alps at Davos, an annual bash of eclectic celebrity capitalists where India was supposedly doing a showstopper-walk, and the tragic suicide of  , an 84-year-old beleaguered farmer from Maharashtra who committed suicide amid the hustle-bustle of Mumbai's non-stop irrepressible energy. There could not have been a more apposite paradox to explain India's inherent contradictions. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made another of his highfalutin speeches to hard-sell India (even as India Inc palpably serenaded him on bent knees, despite the snow), but appeared blissfully unaware of some hard economic data that had surfaced concomitantly from the organisers, the World Economic Forum itself. India's ranking in the Inclusive Development Index had slumped to 62; an appalling commentary on the skewed policies of the last four years of Mr Modi's government which has increased social disparities. Not surprisingly, it seemed to synchronise with the astonishing fact that  . US President Donald Trump followed Modi to justify his America First pitch to the august gathering of essentially free-market fundamentalists. Like India, America has seen an escalating income inequality, ironically electing a tax-evading, anti-free trade, ultra-nationalist avatar in a billionaire businessman with a dubious track-record as its man in the White House. Politics is indeed weird. Even as India's stock markets breached stratospheric levels crossing 35,000 levels prompting pink papers to go into uncontrollable euphoria, Dharma Patil lay dead at JJ hospital. The state government of Maharashtra had refused to respond to his several entreaties for help after it acquired his land for a pathetic pittance. It was unconscionable. The opposition blamed the government of Devendra Fadnavis for culpable homicide; in effect, it was callous nonchalance to a desperate cry for help. It was a stark reminder of one Gajendra Singh from Rajasthan who hung himself from a tree while an election rally proceeded with much fanfare in New Delhi. It was an ugly manifestation of a society that had forgotten its once revered creator of the rice bowl. Evidently, we have chosen to turn a blind eye to the hapless farmer, once deserving of a national call; Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. Arun Jaitley, India's Finance Minister, who famously declared that India will double farmers' income in five years, has been extraordinarily silent on his progress report. Perhaps that is understandable given that after four years of the Modi government , the average agricultural growth is just 1.9 per cent. To achieve the ambitious growth levels projected with profuse showmanship by the government, a minimum of 12 per cent is needed. The target is ridiculously off the curve, but ask any policy wonk and he will tell you that it is always a preposterous kite-flying exercise. That begs the question, have we become so politically immoral that we make even suffering farmers dream of bountiful profits when in fact it is nothing more than a mirage, a chimera? Or are Indian politicians, once elected, decoupled from ground realities? In his farewell budget on February 1, 2018, Mr Jaitley made another grandiloquent claim; that his government had successfully provided for minimum support price of 50 per cent over cost-of-crop production as it had promised in its 2014 manifesto. It seemed like a stunning apocryphal story, because the definition of the cost of production had been deliberately left ambiguous. The convenient formula was adopted, but based on that measure, the farmers were getting 50 per cent over MSP since the UPA days. In that case, what was Modi promising during the 2014 election campaign? At the time of writing, very few in the mainstream media have even questioned this brazen inconsistency. Mr Modi also magnanimously laid out the red carpet for foreign investors citing India's charming hospitality and tranquil environs. But back home it was anything but. The release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's   was meshed in  , and agitating Karni Sena supporters had become official non-state actors, as several BJP state governments happily catapulted to their intimidating threat to not release the controversial film. Chopping off heads of those who were related to the film was publicly broadcasted by these insidious hate groups, but the prime minister did not think a strong condemnation was necessary. Despite a scathing indictment from the Supreme Court, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh refused to screen the film, citing law and order risks. It was tantamount to acquiescing that they were incapable of ensuring governance, despite having the full police force under their authority. The world could see the farcical melodrama turning violent, but India's elected leaders did not budge. What was once classified as right wing fringe was now a legitimate mainstream disruptor, courtesy official umbrage. Their poisonous footprint is on the rise, as punitive action has not been taken. At last count the film was headed for blockbuster box-office collections, and the Rajput community had not found anything offensive enough about it. So what was the purpose behind the belligerent posturing? And why did Indian politicians play ball? But on the day of the hugely hyped budget, something remarkable happened. Even as Mr Jaitley gave his budget speech, from nearby Rajasthan, people spoke in collective unison, condemning both the wilful neglect of the farming community and the senseless mayhem over a commercial film. The BJP got a   in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat. The voters had seen through their forked tongue that sells stardust dreams even as it deliberately ignores solving the real issues. February 1 was a reminder that Indian democracy was still alive. And that Dharma Patil's death would not be forgotten.","title":"Why India needs to remember a farmer forgotten by Modi government","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/income-disparity-modi-government-dharma-patil-arun-jaitley-padmaavat-davos/story/1/22182.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15285},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"Tamil has been on MK Stalin's mind this week. At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ","title":"Hindi is becoming a rallying point in Tamil Nadu politics again","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/tamil-mk-stalin-hindi-tamil-nadu-karunanidhi-madras-high-court-anti-hindi-agitation/story/1/22178.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15286},{"author":"M Reyaz","content":"One of the top trends on Twitter on Saturday was #AnkitSaxena, a 23-year old young photographer from Delhi   by the family members of the 20-year old girl he was allegedly in a relationship with for three years. No, Ankit's case was not trending merely to demand justice for the victim's family or as a debate over the law and order situation in the national capital. Not even because some custodians of culture and tradition are supporting the murderers or because Twitterati are outraged over the \"honour killing\". Ankit's case has instead given the right wing and their whole politics grounds to demonise and target the community they love to hate. Ankit's girlfriend Shehzadi was a Muslim. His killers, the girl's father, mother, uncle and a minor brother also come from the same faith. She had allegedly locked her family members in the house and fled after an argument. The enraged father, accompanied by other family members, came out with a knife in his hand and found Ankit, who lived nearby in west Delhi, on a scooter. A scuffle started. According to the police, as the family members held Ankit tightly, the father of the girl slit his throat. All accused have already been arrested, and a case has been filed at the local police station in west Delhi. One hopes that the law will take its course and the aggrieved family will get justice. What is troubling is that instead of asking for justice certain media and the right wing forces are using the case to bash the entire Muslim community and they are being forced to condemn the gruesome incident. So far only in terror cases guilt by association was raised to target one community, but even though not one person has spoken in support of the murderers, the whole community is being demonised and bashed. Imagine for a moment that the boy was Muslim and girl a Hindu, the right wing would have justified the incident in the name of a purported case of \"love jihad\". On the contrary, I have not come across any Muslim on social media justifying the murder; rather they have all expressed shock, some have condemned it and demanded swift action from the police. It is rather ironical that the same people who are targeting the Muslim community would be asking people to celebrate on February 14, the Valentine's Day, as \"Matri Pitri Poojan Diwas\", and have called Hadiya a victim of love jihad. Religion must have played an important role in the decision of Shehzadi's family to not accept their daughter's choice, but it is more of a patriarchal problem than anything else. I have written earlier, how families find any pretext under the sky to  . Our society at large has still not come to terms with the fact that adult men and women can themselves make a better decision in choosing their life partner, and would rather get them married to people of their choice. The so-called   is one of most dishonourable things for any society that claims to be civilised, irrespective of religion or creed or caste. Professor Dibyesh Anand of Westminster University rightly pointed out after the incident, \"The lethal concept is not a religion but proprietorial-patriarchal-family-honour that afflicts many Hindus, Muslims, and others alike.\" Killing a daughter or her partner for defying them is not unique to any one community but is a larger malaise in our part of the world that sadly often has sanctions from religious leaders as well as community formations such as khap panchayats. Only in January, there was a report of a (Hindu)   as he had dared to marry the girl from another caste. And ironically on the same day Ankit was murdered, I saw a  , of a woman being savagely flogged for an alleged extramarital affair. There is a lesson we can all learn from Ankit's father, Yashpal Saxena. He , who reportedly visited the family, \"I do not have hatred against any community. I have no such (communal) thinking.\"","title":"Shameful to use Ankit Saxena's murder to stoke Hindu-Muslim tensions","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/ankit-saxena-murder-honour-killing-muslims-right-wing-delhi-crime-murder/story/1/22179.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15287},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"The BJP has found itself at the receiving end since a 84-year-old farmer from Dhule, Dharma Patil, died in Mumbai on January 29, less than a week after consuming poison. The Opposition has claimed that Patil consumed the poison outside chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s office at the sixth floor of Mantralaya as the government failed to deliver justice to him. Patil had received compensation of Rs 4 lakh for his five-acre farm whereas his neighbour Kisan Girase got Rs 1.98 crore for one-acre farmland, though both of them had planted mango trees. The case has exposed the chinks in the state’s administration as well as the unholy practices adopted while granting compensation to land. Girase stands accused of paying a bribe of Rs 1 crore to the officials from land acquisition department to get higher compensation. At the same time, a nexus between officials and land-selling agents also has come to fore. Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar admits that the nexus exists. “The government does not make any discrimination between the beneficiaries. It is the officials who misinterpret and take disadvantage of the government schemes,” he told me. It has become a trend over a couple of years to plant mango trees in farm land to increase its value at the time of land acquisition even though the climate does not suit the trees. Water resources minister Girish Mahajan points that agents purchase land from poor farmers at throwaway prices, “import” mango trees from Konkan and demand higher price at the time of acquisition. The mango trees are literally “replanted” to create an impression that they exist in a particular farm land for many years. As per rules, if a farm land has mango trees its values grows multifold. In some cases, the government has given Rs 1 crore for one acre farm land when the actual price was Rs 10 lakh because of the mango trees. “This is not possible without the direct involvement of government officials,” Mahajan admitted. “They know it better which land would be acquired for which project.” He pointed that the government had carried survey of the proposed super communication highway between Nagpur and Mumbai, known as Samruddhi Corridor, using Google maps to count the number of trees on the patch before the project was announced. “If we had not done that the agents would have replanted mango trees everywhere on the corridor making the project economically unviable,” Mahajan said. The government has reserved Rs 10,000 crore only for compensation to land acquisition. The nexus exists for a long time. Patil’s case has given the government an opportunity to break it once and all.  (Courtesy of  )","title":"It's rotten.

A grand scheme intended to tackle an incredibly serious policy issue with almost no details of know-how in the public domain. Yet, it was celebrated as if the outcome it sought had already been achieved. Yesterday (February 1) seemed no different. Once again we forgot what   was good at: fooling us with lofty goals with a tinge of morality added to it. “Modicare”, as it’s now being touted, seeks to provide health insurance to about 100 million “vulnerable” families across India. About 40 per cent of the country’s population (or 500 million beneficiaries) will be \"protected\" under the scheme. Yet somehow its being touted as a system of universal healthcare. A universal scheme should generally cover all citizens, but that’s a matter of separate debate. Unsurprisingly, it overshadowed pretty much everything else in the discussions around the Budget (including a higher fiscal deficit, the introduction of long-term capital gains tax and changes to custom duties for about 50 items). It was supposedly the \"aha moment\" of the  for many TV news anchors and commentators. The general consensus was that the poor and the destitute end up spending a large portion of their income on secondary and tertiary healthcare and that the government is right in providing a helping hand. Imagine if they don’t need to save for a rainy day? Imagine if they are free to use that money to consume goods and services? Imagine what would it do to accelerate growth, and thereby generate greater revenue? Undoubtedly, all of these instances are possible, but it requires a rock-solid combination of detailed plans, smooth execution, a big pot of cash and a ton of luck. Unfortunately, the way our governments are designed, its hard if not impossible to hit such a sweet spot. In this case as well, no basic plan has been charted out yet. The current plan is to draft a plan in the next six months. In terms of execution, it’s best not to glorify government’s notoriously poor record in implementation of schemes. As for cash, the government could easily end up spending thousands of crores of rupees (maybe a lot more depending on premiums). Where will the money come for it is anyone’s guess. But what seems eerily similar to demonetisation is that no cost-benefit analysis of the scheme seems to have been done. And just like demonetisation, this will most certainly become BJP’s major talking point during elections. Leaving aside these minor technicalities, one has to seriously ask if 500 million individuals in India need mandatory insurance from the government? Sure, no one is arguing against not providing subsidy to those below poverty line (and maybe others). But what about those who can? Wouldn’t they be better off left alone in deciding their choice of insurance and allow the government to use the valuable tax revenue for an alternative purpose? Choice matters as that will allow greater competition amongst private/public insurance companies and not just benefit those who are contracted with the government. India has only so many resources at hand and it would have been ideal to allow states to chart their own course (health is a state subject) rather than initiate a massive scheme from the top. Secondly, most debates moved around the ifs and buts on the health coverage. Not many offered a view from an ideological and principled standpoint. It’s rather easy to get bothered by questions around the government’s ability to fund or implement the project, but its far more important to ask if the government should sponsor such a scheme at all. A similar scheme was proposed in 2016 which offered a coverage of Rs 30,000 per family. That has now been raised to Rs 5 lakh per family. Those in Opposition can always offer another substantial hike until we will reach a point of no return. What are the chances that the government will do away with such a mandate even when most Indians will easily be able to afford it? Third, instead of focusing on drafting policies (reforming land, labour and capital) that would eventually pull people out of poverty and allow them to make enough money to pay for their own and family’s health/education, the government is creating another tax-payer funded entitlement. Yes, both (growth and redistribution) can go on simultaneously, but there is just not enough noise and movement on the former. What looks probable right now is that we will go through another loop of good intentions and bad outcomes. But considering how lucky PM Modi is (and was through the execution of demonetisation), it may just work in his favour, of course electorally.","title":"Budget 2018: How achievable is Arun Jaitley's promise of health cover for 500 million poor Indians?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/health-insurance-union-budget-arun-jaitley-demonetisation-november-8-2016-modi-election-promise/story/1/22143.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15289},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"Going into the last full Union Budget of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only bet on the farmers, but bet the farm on his rural voters. Articulating his vision for the general election of 2019 quite clearly, he has recognised the existence of rural distress, amplified by a string of farmer protests and suicides last year provoked by falling commodity prices and increasing debt. Hoping to deliver on his promise to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, the Budget has shown every intention of boosting farmers’ incomes by raising the minimum support price for crops to 1.5x the cost of production, liberalising export of agri-commodities, and modernising agricultural markets. This comes in the wake of agri-GDP registering an insipid average annual growth rate of 2 per cent in the first three years of the Modi government - in the last three years of the UPA rule, it was nearly twice this figure. The second clear narrative in Modi Vision 2019 is the creation of jobs. The Budget has seen a push to small businesses, which were badly hit both by demonetisation and the initial implementation of GST. The corporate tax reduction for firms with turnovers below Rs 250 crore as well as Rs 3,794 crore in credit support to MSMEs could help. The continuing push to infrastructure, with expected investments in excess of Rs 50 lakh crore in roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways, is also of a piece with this strong effort - unemployment emerged as the biggest concern among respondents to the India Today Mood of the Nation Poll last week, along with rising prices. Equally clear is the government’s belated recognition of the importance of healthcare and education. As Amartya Sen says, no developed country in the world has progressed without investing in these key areas. On education, the Budget has announced Eklavya schools for tribals as well as 24 new medical colleges and 1,000 new fellowships for doctoral students. In healthcare, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an ambitious National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide up to Rs 5 lakh per year to 100 million families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. Impressive as this sounds, I am not sure the mechanisms or details of funding have been worked out. The expense could be monumental. There is a disconcertingly familiar sense of too many announcements and too little implementation. Take the example of the Smart Cities Mission, announced in 2015, which aimed at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-the-art amenities. So far, 99 cities have been selected with an outlay of Rs 2.04 lakh crore. But projects worth a mere Rs 2,350 crore have been completed. The rest remain \"in progress\". That’s a pathetic strike rate, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the government’s ability to deliver. Given the additional spending, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019 will require disinvestment and the highest ever gross taxes as a percentage of GDP. It is a tough ask, according to Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi, one of the eminent economists in our panel of commentators, but not entirely unachievable. The Budget has nothing for the middle class and large corporates, who in many ways are the bulwark of the economy. The big question is, whether all this will be enough - especially given that the GDP growth rate is expected to fall to 6.75 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to 7.1 the previous year. So far, the economic environment was conducive, but now oil prices have crossed $70 a barrel internationally, and retail inflation has breached the RBI’s target, hitting 5.21 per cent in December. Also, there is nothing to spur the investment rate which has fallen from a peak of nearly 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 26.4 per cent in 2017-18. Unless the government is able to move the needle on this, it is difficult to imagine the accelera­tion in economic growth so necessary to finance its ambitious schemes. My own nagging concern is an old one: I am not sure how much of government expenditure actually reaches the intended beneficiary. In 1985, on a visit to drought-affected Kalahandi in Odisha, the late Rajiv Gandhi said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reached the intended recipient. Has that leaky bucket been fixed? If not, the electoral benefits this government is hoping  for after this Budget may not materialise. Elections are not won on grand announcements or manifestos, but on real development on the ground which people can feel.

And when she’s not working, meaning governing the state or minding politics, she is into creative pursuits — writing books, penning lyrics, composing songs, painting and doodling. Mamata Banerjee has been recently awarded the prestigious DLitt by Calcutta University for her versatile contribution in the field of literature and language and for her gigantic footprints in social work. There was much hue and cry, storm over tea stalls, debates dragging into court as to whether she merited the honorary degree. Ultimately she got the degree and she accepted it teary-eyed and her voice choking, partly for the love and appreciation of a section of people, who considered her eligible, and partly for the insult, humiliation and barbs she had to face in the process. Without going into the sanctity of the awardee, the literary merit of her work, which can be purely subjective (depending on who are judging it, on what basis, under what condition and who are conferring the title), one cannot deny the sheer numbers she has added to the world of printed letters. Half a dozen books a year is child’s play for her and she has been spewing such volume at every Kolkata Book Fair. And for all her detractors crying foul, the books are published by a leading publishing house of Bengal and they are always bestsellers — well at least as per the records of the publishing house. This year too, as the city warms up to another book fair, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is coming out again with not less than half a dozen new publications. She has a volume of already 70 published works and this year it will increase to 76. And think of the range, she has something for everyone: names of babies for would-be or new parents, rhyme-books for toddlers,   for children,   (voice of heart) Urdu shayaris for the youth,   — something about personality development of the young generation, and   (exhorting the young brigade to consider politics as a noble profession) to travelogues ( ) for the trotting community. Her memoirs on struggle —  , the tidbits of bitter-sweet memories of life —  , her youth, desires sacrificed at the altar of politics — Bikel Hnariye Geche (a personal note on how the sweet spring has slipped by), and   — a compilation of quotable quotes on the philosophy and ideology of her life, an allusion to Kathamrita — quotes of Ram Krishna Dev for the spiritually inclined, are her other book. Not to be missed is the historical documentation of important landmark events from the political work — Nandi Ma (the land movement in Nandigram), Singur, Kutshapokksho (Rumour Mongers), a commentary on how the Opposition and the BJP-led Centre were engaged in a slandering campaign to malign her on the eve of 2016 Assembly, Notebandi (Demonetisation) and this year its   (intolerance). Though the majority of the political memoirs are political campaign on her sweat and labour and the string of achievements she has been weaving in, Asohishnuta is an interesting record of the environment of hatred, fear and intolerance unleashed by the saffron party both in the country and her state. The diversity of subject and magnitude of work apart, one should not miss the proficiency of language, the ease with which she nimbly moves through languages, Bengali, English, Urdu and Ol Chiki, some of her books are being translated into Ol Chiki. So if these are not grounds, solid enough to confer her the D.litt, what are? As for the sceptical and high-browed critics, especially those who are deprecating, the Calcutta University as the conferring body chose to seal all probable leaks. The award has been given by virtue of her literary works and her social welfare activities, which have been acknowledged internationally and she has even got the prestigious UN Public Service award for Kanyashree — the scheme for empowering women. The DLitt debate has been dismissed by the court perhaps because it realised that wisdom lies in closing the chapter. After all, there is nothing new in conferring titles and awards to political personalities, great administrators and statesman and it has been the practice all over the world. When men of letters like Dr Mammohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and legends like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi get awarded, the country bursts into euphoria, and rightly so. But the feeling definitely cannot be the same when Akshay Kumar (University of Windsor in 2008) and Shilpa Shetty Kundra flaunt one or godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim claims a doctorate title from some little known UK university. The fact that PM Narendra Modi declined to be awarded a doctorate by BHU in 2016 at the peak of his popularity in recognition of him being a reformer and an outstanding leader in public service and governance is a rare, pragmatic thing. Had he accepted he would have invited similar muck throwing as happened in the case of Mamata.

At least, that was his poll promise of \"na goondaraj, na bhrashtachar (freedom from goons and corruption)\" to the state. However, this year's Republic Day clashes tell a very different story altogether. As residents of Kasganj, belonging to different communities, began preparing for the 69th Republic Day celebrations, a group of ABVP and VHP cadres set out on a bike rally. Passing through every mohalla, they finally reached Baliram Gate. This group, which had no police permission, was also carrying saffron flags - enough to instigate a communal outburst. As they approached the minority-dominated area, their slogans grew louder. Soon, what started out as a verbal spat turned into a violent clash with both sides throwing stones at the other. One man reached for his gun and fired in frenzy which hit 20-year-old Chandan Gupta, killing him two hours later. Another man, Naushad, was also hit in the leg by a bullet and is now recovering at an Aligarh hospital. This was enough to trigger the mob, which went on a rampage across the town. The district police force was in Etah for the Republic Day parade as the town erupted into flames. A mosque was set ablaze and the police, in an FIR, said stones were hurled and bullets fired on them as they tried to quell the commotion. By afternoon, Yogi's promise of \"na goondaraj\" was blown into pieces as shops and buses burning to cinders became the image of Kasganj. The police, unable to control the situation, imposed curfew to restrict mob movement. One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and five companies of Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) along with police forces from adjoining districts were deployed in Kasganj. The district magistrate, inspector-general of police, commissioner of Aligarh and at least half a dozen other IPS officers from adjoining areas were deputed to control the surging violence. But all these measures had no bearing on the rapidly deteriorating condition of Kasganj. Around 9.30pm, Lakhimpur resident Mohammad Akram, unaware of the violence, was on his way home with his pregnant wife in a Tata Safari. As he reached Kasganj, the mob attacked his car. They broke the windows with bamboo sticks and almost gouged out his left eye. \"They saw my beard and attacked me. My wife is expecting and the delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,\" Akram said, his face covered in blood. Akram was attacked in the middle of the town, Agrasen Gate, and the police was absolutely unaware of the situation. Fortunately, the local correspondent of Aaj Tak, Devesh Pal Singh, who was present there informed a senior police officer even as he recorded a video on his mobile phone. By this time, the mob had already put kerosene on Akram and his pregnant wife in an attempt to burn them alive. The senior officer responded swiftly and sent his forces just in time to save them. Akram is now recuperating in a hospital. Just 50 metres from here, BJP MP Rajveer Singh, along with a few other legislators, district magistrate and police officers were at the residence of Chandan Gupta, requesting them to cremate Chandan's body, but the family was struck to their demand of \"status of martyrdom\" for their dead son. The deadlock ended around 2am after the family was given verbal assurance of a government job to a family member and Rs 50 lakh as compensation. However, three days after his death, Chandan's family has received a cheque of Rs 20 lakh. On January 27, Chandan was cremated in the morning and even as his mortal remains were set on the pyre, Kasganj continued to burn. Around 200 meters from the cremation ground, one bus and a shop were set on fire while some locals vandalised a garage. Minutes later, three more buses and three shops were set ablaze by them. All the shops and vehicles were owned by the local Muslim population who till one day ago were living peacefully with the Hindus.  What was shocking was that these incidents were taking place within a range of 500 metres from where hundreds of policemen and two companies of paramilitary forces were standing guard.  As we witnessed, it appeared that a section of the locals belonging to a particular community were given a free hand by the local administration, allowing them to go on a rampage against the minorities.   Parliamentarian Rajveer Singh in a statement to us blamed the Muslims for the clashes. \"Muslims are responsible for this incident. It was pre-planned and they will be dealt with strict action,\" he said. Virendra Tomar, VHP leader, said, \"It's time for us to give a fitting reply to \"love jihad\". If they kill one of us, we will kill 10 of them. The police is our servant and they will work on our instructions.\" After several incidents of violence since the morning of January 27, the mob, led by a local VHP leader, took on the policemen. With no courage to face the crowd, a senior police officer called a VHP leader and requested him to ask their cadres to vacate the streets. The VHP leader agreed to the officer's request, but while walking away, he warned the police that within 48 hours, they will ensure that Kasganj is on fire. The political conspiracy was quite clear following the clashes which started on January 26. Now, there was only pressure from the innocent locals and media on the administration and police officers to act.  On January 28, when we confronted the suprintendent of police, Sunil Singh (who has now been transferred), as to why they failed to control the situation, he categorically said, \"This is being done on the instructions of a few people (higher-ups) and I cannot rule out any political conspiracy.\" His statement on camera probably cost him his job as he was transferred from Kasganj. Politics over Kasganj violence is at its peak with BJP and VHP leaders making controversial remarks, and parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party blaming the BJP for polarisation for the upcoming elections. In this political tussle, the ones suffering are the common people. Situated on the banks of Kala Nadi (Black river), most of the population in Kasganj is dependent on daily business for their survival. With a population of little above one million, Kasganj district has approximately 66 per cent Hindus and 33 per cent Muslims. And in last one decade, there has been no incident of any communal violence. Five days on, Kanganj continues to simmer while politicians are busy trying to cash in on communal sentiments.  ","title":"How politics is fanning the communal flames in Kasganj","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kasganj-violence-mohammad-akram-pregnant-wife-district-magistrate-sunil-singh-transferred-yogi-adityanath/story/1/22090.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15292},{"author":"AVM Manmohan Bahadur","content":"Technological asymmetry has been an understated cog that goes into deciding victors in interstate conflicts — for, it is finally the image of a victorious soldier, sailor or airman that lingers — on in human memory. While the \"man behind the machine\" is important, there comes a stage where the superiority of warfighting implements overcomes the prowess of a warrior. We have witnessed that when the bow and arrow overcame the mightiest of land warriors only to be overcome itself by the lance; the bow, lance, sword, shield et al were steamrolled when gun powder came on the scene. And so has been the story over centuries leading to tanks, submarines and now air power, whose instruments have become deciding factors in winning battles and affecting the way war progresses. Adverse technological asymmetry has been fatal down history; India is in the dangerous position of getting on the wrong side of the tech asymmetry curve vis-a-vis its neighbours, especially China — this should be lighting up red bulbs in South Block. The Chinese military-industrial complex has matured to a point where it has become the world’s third largest major arms exporter. Though this is especially true in the field of air defence systems, UAVs and mid-capability fighter and transport aircraft. While the J-20 stealth aircraft has been inducted (production rate being ramped to 36 aircraft per year) and is going through its operational paces, there are reports that the J-31 is being converted to become a carrier borne stealth fighter. This would affect Indian naval power adversely as there are no reports of a corresponding development for the Indian Navy, which is still debating after the shelving of the Naval Tejas programme, whether to get more trouble prone MiG-29K for the indigenous aircraft carrier or some other foreign aircraft. The Chinese have produced the sixth Y-20 Very Heavy Transport Aircraft which will become the mainstay of long range airlift as well as the base aircraft for AWACS and inflight refuelling. They have tied up with the Russians for making a new Advanced Heavy Lift helicopter for the Tibetan plateau and have bought from Ukraine, lock stock and barrel, rights to the world’s biggest transport aircraft, the An-225. The massive airlift capability that will accrue to the PLA can well be imagined! Secure communications, that are so vital in war, will become their forte with research being done in quantum technology. Similar advancements are happening in the land and naval armament arena but the advantage that India presently has with its superior aircraft and aircrew over its Northern frontiers may be slowly slipping away. Air power assets do not come cheap and it is necessary that a nation, vying for a seat at the table of the powerful, commits enough monies towards their acquisition. While the depleting squadron strength of the IAF is being regularly debated, it is the other equally vital aspects too that merit government’s attention. We have only three AWACS and six Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and no additional ones on the horizon. This writer is witness to the selection of a new FRA in 2009, but the proposal was shot down on \"high\" costs. The reshoot of the project met a similar fate five years hence and now we have floated another tender last week! Will this be cheaper now? No way! Reports from HAL about the ramping up of Tejas are not encouraging and prototype testing of the Tejas Mk1A, eighty-three of which will be bought, is some distance away. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft seems a mirage while the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft project is still on the drawing board. The real silver lining is the transport aircraft and helicopter fleets of the IAF that constitute a very potent airlift capability, but these aircraft too are all imported – hopefully, their maintenance contracts are being addressed in time to have adequate availability on the flight line. A healthy combat-ready flight line demonstrates the deterrence that air power affords a nation. The forthcoming national budget is awaited with great anticipation by the armed forces. Technological asymmetry should not be allowed to handicap our first-rate war fighters. : The Economic Survey for 2017-18 brings out the startling fact that India spends only 0.7 per cent of its GDP on Research & Development while China spends 2.1 per cent, the US 2.8 per cent and Israel 4.3 per cent. If the R&D spend is worked out in monetary terms the huge difference between China and India would be abundantly clear as Beijing’s GDP is five times India’s. It is a no-brainer that this is a clear indicator of the fact that technological asymmetry would only increase unless some radical steps are urgently taken by the government to ameliorate the imbalance.

After all, pooh-poohed its strategic experts, the first iteration a decade ago was short-lived and fizzled out. The Quad’s second coming, however, has so far appeared more robust — or robust enough to concern Beijing. Two top officials who travelled to Delhi in December — state councillor Yang Jiechi and foreign minister Wang Yi — both made oblique references to the danger of “small groups” getting together with the aim of containing others. They both also referred to what they saw as unhelpful meddling by the US in the South China Sea and hoped India would continue its “independent” foreign policy. So, when four top naval officials of the Quad countries took the stage together in Delhi in January’s Raisina Dialogue, Beijing duly saw red. Especially when the commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, openly called China a disruptor, and Japan’s naval chief Admiral Kawano called for countries to come together to counter Chinese naval expansionism amid muscle-flexing in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The hawkish Chinese tabloid   wrote that “the Raisina Dialogue was elaborately planned to serve as a platform for countries like the US, Japan and Australia, to show their tough stance towards China and Russia, and meanwhile demonstrate India’s position of trying to balance between Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific region, in addition to India’s independent major power status and dissatisfaction with China.” The unprecedented joint attendance of 10 ASEAN leaders, days later at the Republic Day parade in Delhi, further deepened the angst in Beijing, with the same newspaper in an editorial raging that “some members of the Indian elite enjoy engaging in geopolitical bluster. But they cannot truly gauge the reality of India’s comprehensive strength and diplomatic experience. They are beginners playing at geopolitics.” “New Delhi is not Beijing’s major trading partner, and, despite border disputes, is not an imminent security threat to us Chinese,” the editorial said. “However, some Indians keep pestering us, asking us to acknowledge that India is developing better than China.” New Delhi, with a GDP that’s only one-fifth of China’s, has been striving to prevail over Beijing in almost all aspects.” It concluded, “Honestly speaking, Chinese people are not occupied by India.” But apparently occupied enough to warrant a stream of concerned editorials in the state media.

Both Dalit leaders - one from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the other from Gujarat - they are charismatic young men who offer possibilities of a new and vibrant Dalit movement in a national landscape as riven by caste as ever. Both are lawyers, both are Ambedkarite - Azad more than Mevani - and both are modern rationalists in the Ambedkarite tradition. To be sure, they are not Dalit Panthers. Azad, despite the fact that he calls his group an army, spends most of his efforts on ensuring education for Dalit children. Mevani works to ensure land officially belonging to Dalits is returned to them. Both are constitutional leaders, believers in the rule of law, anti-violence and careful to defuse any situation that has the potential to turn violent. Despite widespread claims that both either incite or actually preach violence they have been against stoking of conflict between Dalits and Muslims or retaliatory actions against upper caste violence. It is symptomatic of our times that despite this, both are seen as terrifying threats to the Indian state, the media and the right wing middle and upper castes and classes in India - all of which amount to the same thing really.  chief Azad is in jail under a battery of false cases since June 2017. More recently the UP government has   under the National Security Act, an absurd law to invoke in his case. Mevani is constantly attacked in the media, especially since he joined electoral politics and won a seat in Vadgam, Gujarat. Recently he came under fire for refusing to entertain Republic TV in Chennai and for offering a critical appraisal of BR Ambedkar which was predictably and deliberately taken out of context. Why are the two such threats despite being no more than militant liberals? Part of the answer lies in the fact that they have an Ambedkarite pride in their Dalit identity and are very clear that it is their right and duty not to be quiet in the face of caste-based abuse and exploitation. In the feudal state of Uttar Pradesh, Azad and Mevani have emerged as a formidable challenge at a time the threat posed by the   lost both substance and direction. The BJP therefore considers it important to quash them and their politics at all costs. In the deeply communal Gujarat, the mobilisation of Dalits and Muslims by a dynamic leader can spell doom for the dominant BJP. The recent elections and Mevani's thumping victory was a taste of that destabilising effect for the dominant party. Both men are also articulate and not fooled by any of the smokescreen discourses of the dominant party. If Mevani is the more urbane and suave of the two, Azad has a clarity born from being grounded in his location and a compassion that gives his home-grown north Indian machismo an unusual edge. This is why both are an anathema to the mostly inarticulate, unintelligent leaders of the dominant, or indeed, any party. Both men came to prominence over democratic contestations of violence against Dalits. In Mevani's case, it was the atrocity in Una; in Azad's case the atrocity in Shabbirpur. This is really at the heart of the hatred, fear and resentment directed against the two. They are not going to remain silent about atrocities against Dalits and their responses to it are not reactive but proactive, collective and systematic. Mevani has openly spoken in support of Azad, particularly after his arrest. The combination of the two men is more frightening than taking on them individually. Mevani has the theoretical tools and a critical engagement with history, Ambedkarite and otherwise. His speech taken out of the context by the media recently shows that he is neither hagiographic about Ambedkar nor his Communist heroes and knows that historical circumstances have changed and so must theories, even as his primary commitment to their vision remains. Azad has a hands-on engagement with the community which forms the foundation of his politics but his vision is resolutely and uncritically Ambedkarite. Both have much to offer each other and what is important is that both are cognisant of the need to combine theoretical vision and grassroots politics. Mevani sees himself as a social movement activist; Azad sees himself as putting Ambedkarite thinking into action. Both have much to say to each other. But with a hostile state, media and middle class combine, things are not easy for them. The internet Ambedkarites are mostly silent about them, when not critical of them. That is the privilege of internet activists. They do not have to get their hands dirty. It is important for us to nurture these two young men. They are by no means perfect but they are the best we have. On gender, their thinking has not gone very far. On the issue of politics of sexuality, they have not thought much. Neither of them is in touch with his subconscious - both deal mainly with the rational and the legal/constitutional - but it is our duty to widen the scope of their vision. In the mindlessly neoliberal, rabidly anti-intellectual and activism-phobic times we live in, they are reminders that not all is lost. Not fooled by hyper nationalism, grounded in local struggles and unafraid to stand up for who they are, Chandrashekhar Azad and Jignesh Mevani might well be the reasons for us to start thinking again. That they are both really handsome and hot is just an added bonus.","title":"Why everyone feels threatened by Jignesh Mevani and Chandrashekhar Azad","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrashekhar-azad-jignesh-mevani-dalit-politics-vadgam-gujarat-bhim-army-br-ambedkar/story/1/22046.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15295},{"author":"Ashok Upadhyay","content":"Speaking at the 70th foundation day of the  (NCC), prime minister Narendra Modi said no one would be spared in his drive against corruption. Seeking cooperation of the youth in the battle against corruption and black money, the PM said, “I don’t think any youth of my country is now willing to tolerate corruption. The hate for corruption in the society is visible… I want you to help end corruption that is like a termite.\" Countering the general perception that the rich and the powerful mostly get away while the poor get the short shrift in corruption cases, the PM said, “The country used to discuss corruption in despair, the lament being 'no one catches the powerful'. Three former chief ministers are now rotting in jail. Who says there is no justice? No one will be spared.\" The prime minister was talking about the three former chief ministers who are currently in jail. While former Bihar chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra have been convicted and sentenced in cases related to the fodder scam, former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala is serving a jail term following conviction in a recruitment scam. Three former chief ministers landing in jail on graft charges is certainly unprecedented in seven decades of independent India as far as corruption is concerned. It is also not the norm in a country where the general perception is that the powerful political class is never punished, and are above the law. But going by how the prime minister placed the issue in his speech, it may seem like it was his government which ensured the conviction of these powerful people. But is that truly the case? Let us first talk about the fodder scam cases. In March 1996, the CBI was brought into the case as per the Supreme Court’s order. Lalu Yadav was named as accused in six cases.  The central investigation agency filed chargesheets against Lalu Yadav and 55 other co-accused in 1997.  On 30 September 2013, a special CBI court in Ranchi convicted former Lalu Prasad Yadav and Jagannath Mishra along with 44 others in the case. The court had announced a sentence of five years for Lalu Yadav and four years for Jagannath Mishra. On January 6, Lalu Yadav was again convicted in another fodder scam case and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. On January 24, a special CBI court in Ranchi awarded five years jail to Lalu Yadav and Jagannath Mishra, this being the third case in which verdict has been pronounced. Barring orders by the courts in the last two cases, nothing has happened after Narendra Modi took over as the prime minister of India. So his or his government’s role is certainly not a factor in sending Lalu Prasad and Jagannath Mishra to jail. In the teacher’s recruitment scam case, in which former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala has been convicted, started in 2003. The Supreme Court ordered a CBI probe. In June 2008, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the court of special CBI judge against 62 people including OP Chautala. In January 2013, the court convicted Chautala and sent him to jail for 10 years. So Om Prakash Chautala was already in jail by the time Modi became the prime minister. It is very clear from the facts that in none of the three court cases involving the three former chief ministers did Modi or his government has a role to play. So while decrying corruption, the PM forgot to clarify that the credit for putting these powerful politicians behind bars was not his for the taking.  Is this not a form of moral corruption, or did the PM not realise what he was implying?","title":"Modi may be hitting corruption hard, but what has jail for 3 former CMs to do with him?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/corruption-bjp-modi-black-money-fodder-scam-lalu-yadav-jagannath-mishra-op-chautala/story/1/22062.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15296},{"author":"Harsh Mander","content":"Our second day of the Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018 was India’s 67th Republic Day. We spent this day travelling in remote rural Bengal, meeting families of three young men who were lynched, and their bodies mutilated and dismembered. This was one more lynching in the country that was celebrated by videotaping the killing and circulating the recording triumphantly on social media. It was claimed at that time, by the crowds, the police and even representatives of the ruling party, that a mob of villagers killed them because they were cow thieves. The story we heard in our travels was all too familiar, one troublingly similar to those that we have heard over and over again in the eight states to which the Karwan has travelled so far. It was the evening of the 27th roza fast of Ramazan in Eid on   midsummer last year. Three friends in three different villages in the North Bengal district of Uttar Dinajpur were enjoying the special Iftar meal to break their fasts with their families, in anticipation of the Eid celebrations that were to follow. The friends were all in their mid-twenties. Two were day labourers ready to do any work that was locally offered to them – construction work, farm labour, tea leaf plucking, and whatever else came their way; one was trying to set up a small business. All the three friends were married, with small children. Each of their families reported to us that their mobile phones rang while they were eating. Each said that the young men initially said to whoever called that they were reluctant to leave their family celebrations but finally conceded. They speculate that because the three of them often took petty construction assignments together, perhaps this was what they were called away so urgently for. But they now have no way of knowing for sure. Two of the young men left on their bikes, one walked and was picked up some distance away. They did not return that night. The next morning, each of the families was summoned to the police station. To collect their sons’ savaged bodies, dead and mutilated after mob lynching. The first family we met was in the village Dhulagoch. The young man Nasruddin’s ageing father, Yasin Mohammed, with a white beard, white singlet and blue lungi customary for men of his age, met us weeping. For the hour that we were with him, he would not leave my hand. He was joined by his mother, bent over with age and mourning, the boy’s mother, his widow Anisa and their two small children. The entire family sobbed out loud and long as they shared with us the trauma of his loss six months earlier, and the nightmare of what followed. He used to work in Delhi as a truck driver. After a road accident, his father called him back home. It did not matter if he earned less as work was uncertain and low-paid. At least he was safe and close to home. The morning after he did not return home, a policeman of the village came to their home in civil clothes. He showed them a video of a lynching. To their horror, they could recognise that one of the young men being attacked was Nasruddin. They rushed to the police station, only to be handed his bloodied and defaced dead body. The distraught families of his two friends were also there. We met their families as well in the course of our journey today. Nasirul’s mother Masida Begum and wife Marjina in the village Kutipada; and Samiruddin’s widow in the village Kandapora. Nasirul’s widow gave birth to a daughter months after he had died. Two of the bodies of the young men were lying in an ambulance, and a third on a hospital stretcher. They were disfigured and dismembered, with limbs smashed and crushed, and even their genitals stoned. The police would tell them nothing more than that villagers of a neighbouring Hindu village Durgapur had found them stealing cows. They had caught and in their mass fury lynched them. The families were enraged at the charge of their boys being cow thieves. \"Would anyone in their right mind set out to steal cows on motor cycles?\" they asked indignantly. But they reported that the police was rough with them. Two of the post-mortems were completed before the families arrived. One was done with the family present. The police then handed over the bodies to the families. The dazed and grieving families spent their own money to transport the bodies to their home before they confined each to their graves. After their deaths, some local politicians came to see them, and some people from the local media. A local politician announced that he was convinced that the men were indeed cow smugglers, without offering any proof. No senior officials, to offer help or solace. One family reported that the local block office gave them some grain and a bag of rice. Nothing else. We found the families in extreme want, with their able-bodied bread earners suddenly lost. The families were desperate to know the truth of who had killed their sons and husbands so viciously, and why. We looked at the papers of the cases, and found that the police had registered cases under Section 304, of culpable homicide not amounting to murder; and not murder under Section 302.  The faces of the killers and a large crowd of onlookers were clearly visible in the video they circulated. But only three men were ultimately arrested, and released on bail in just a fortnight because of the lenient sections of the Indian Penal Code under which they had been charged. The families went in delegations to the police station, but report that they were roughly tuned away without answers. They claim that the police threatened that they too would be locked up if they made too much trouble. The villages planned a gherao surrounding the police station. But a local representative of the panchayat – the same who said the men were cow smugglers - dissuaded them. He said that if they did this, it would anger their Hindu neighbours, and might result in Hindu-Muslim riots. It was wise, their representative advised them, to remain silent to avoid trouble in which in the end only they would suffer. They finally accepted this counsel – whether out of voluntary restraint, or despair. We decided that we should try to get some answers from the police to the grieving families. We took representatives from each of the three families with us to the Chopra Police Station. We waited for an hour before the circle inspector agreed to see us. We told him about the Karwan, and our concerns for the families whose sons had been lynched, that they were entitled to know the progress in the investigations into the lynching. I also asked if charges of murder had at least now been instituted against the killers. He said he would not speak to us until he had the permission of the district superintendent of police. He spoke to his superior in our presence and then replied that he was not authorised to give us any answers at all. I asked heatedly how as a public servant, he could turn away the families of the bereaved families. But he was adamant. We left Bengal intensely troubled about how deep the poison of communal hatred has penetrated even a part of India that has maintained greater communal peace after Partition than most others. The villagers in all the three villages to which we travelled said that apart from stray and minor incidents, there had before this been no major incidents of communal tension and violence between Hindus and Muslims of the area before this. All of this lies shattered after the lynching of the three young men, aggravated first by the charge that they were cow thieves, and then the refusal of the state administration to extend to them solace, support or justice of any kind. This is a failure also that I feel compelled to point to, of local civil liberty groups and progressive and secular political parties. My greatest disappointment was to observe that the attitude of the state administration to the victim families whose loved ones had been felled by hate violence was no different from that of the administrations of BJP ruled states. I could easily instead have been in Gujarat, or Rajasthan, or Uttar Pradesh, and not West Bengal. The betrayal of governments of political parties that claim to be secular in failing to defend their minorities rankles painfully and erodes the secular promises of India’s constitution. Today’s was a journey made even more painful because we made it on the day that the Indian government was celebrating its republic with displays of its military might and cultural pageantry. The despair and fear in the eyes of the members of the three families we met on this day in Bengal villages revealed how hollowed out are the promises of India’s republic to its most vulnerable citizens, and how weakly we all defend these.","title":"Karwan-e-Mohabbat 2018: Lynchings expose the hollowed out promises of India’s republic","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karwan-e-mohabbat-lynchings-hate-crimes-bengal-bjp-congress/story/1/22013.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15297},{"author":"Kartik Mittal","content":"Last year, the powerful Arab quartet of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt abruptly announced a diplomatic and economic blockade against another regional pseudo-ally – the state of  . The four countries led the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in accusing Qatar of supporting and funding terrorism and manipulating internal affairs of its neighbouring states. Widely regarded as the most-advanced Arab state for human development by the UN, 85 per cent of the country’s population comprises expatriates, set against just 313,000 Qatari citizens in a population of 2.6 million. Qatar is also a high-income economy, with the world’s third-largest natural-gas reserves and oil reserves. Qatar, which was abruptly shunned by its immediate neighbours, and had little or no indication of the crisis that began as an extension of the Qatar-Saudi proxy conflict. The involvement of the other regional GCC nations, including Bahrain, Egypt and UAE in the blockade further complicated the position to negotiate, as the quartet had a unified and unwavering stance in dedicating the terms for appeasement. The countries cited Qatar's alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for their action, insisting that Qatar has violated a 2014 agreement with the members of the GCC. The GCC also felt threatened by the media arm of Qatar - Al Jazeera - for engaging in what they termed as a \"media conspiracy\" against the nations, and also for the country’s proximity with Iran. Now entering its eight month, the blockade by the GCC nations effectively amounts to economic sanctions on Qatar, which has rendered  , travel, trade and diplomatic restrictions. The effect of these sanctions has been widespread, crippling several companies operating out of the country, and including its citizens and expatriates. The abrupt notice and enforcement of the sanctions had also meant the country was put in a limbo, freezing several of its regional assets and disrupting everyday operations.   As a small gas-rich nation, Qatar has been balancing its trade with heavy dependence on its oil and gas exports for subsidising its food and industrial imports. With its land border with Saudi Arabia closed, Qatar’s food imports initially dropped substantially, before recovering via expensive alternatives. While the allegations against Qatar’s supposed terror-funding has been the prime focal point, in reality, it is also an extension of the regional differences, especially manifested after the network’s coverage since the 2011 Arab Spring. Al Jazeera, the state-funded broadcaster in Doha, was one of the significant nerve-points in the diplomatic blockade, as the GCC members have over the past continued to express distrust over the network’s coverage of the Arab Spring and for “negatively portraying” the local governments. In fact, the complete shutdown of Al Jazeera was one of the terms put forward jointly by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to even commence negotiations. The direct losses incurred by Qatar, along with the indirect losses, would amount to several billion dollars, and the country is already exploring legal avenues to claim compensation from the GCC countries. Several senior ministers have also indicated that Qatar has contracted a specialised legal team to study the actions taken by the blockading countries against it. The country has also been clear in its position on backing Al Jazeera, effectively ruling out any calls for its shutdown.  While the blockade imposed by the GCC is geo-political, efforts by the members in calling for a wider global support, including from the UN is far-fetched. The issue was momentarily complicated when US President Donald Trump took credit for the Saudi-led actions (which was initiated shortly after his visit to the region), but nevertheless it did not gain any traction as international consensus, including from the European Union and the United Nations, among other nations, had called for the resolution of the diplomatic crisis through dialogue. The gas-rich nation has virtually been cornered over its movements - both financially (for its current instruments/investments in the GCC countries) and physically, having to re-rout its land and sea movements via Iran.     Surprisingly, despite all the extreme measures by the GCC quartet to arm-wrestle Qatar, countries, including the UAE and Oman, continue to depend on Qatar’s gas pipeline to power their infrastructure. Qatar continues to pump around two billion cubic feet of gas per day to the UAE, showing no signs of impact from the sanctions.","title":"US-GCC sanctions: One year on, how Qatar is weathering the crisis","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/qatar-blockade-gcc-saudi-us-al-jazeera-donald-trump-arab-spring/story/1/22006.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15298},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"In the most anticipated speech of the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, the last hurrah as it were, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, outlined his idea of America at the globalist platform, asserting that the two are not at odds with each other. Declaring that \"America First\" - the motto of his nationalist government under the Republican party banner - isn't an automatic route to \"America alone\", Trump dispelled some of the widely held fears that he would hijack WEF's overtly internationalist outlook with his nationalist zeal, upsetting the applecart somewhat.   Instead of railing against the transnational order, Trump trained guns at \"predatory trading practices\", saying each country has the right to safeguard its interests. Hinting at the wide-scale off shoring of jobs and manufacturing by American companies over cheap labour and cost, Trump said he has cut corporate taxes to make America \"open for business\" again, something that wasn't being done since the time of Ronald Reagan, Trump's Republican antecedent.  While the tax cuts are being hotly debated in the US national media, concurrent with other policies of the Trump-led White House, such as depleting medical cover for the poor and the middle classes, immigration tightening and strict regulation of previously lenient visa norms such as the H-1B, etc, the US president waxed eloquent about the stock market boom that has followed since the cuts were announced. Trump also spoke of America being a great investment destination, hard-selling his country against a resurgent Europe under the twin leadership of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump also pitched America as an alternative to obvious Asian markets such as India and China. In fact, parts of Trump's speech sounded similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's keynote address at the opening plenary session on January 23, especially the well-oiled business-friendly pitch. While PM Modi had warned against \"protectionism\", Trump sounded a caveat, saying every country has the right to defend itself economically. However, unlike PM Modi, Trump made no reference to climate change, given his high-profile exit from the Paris climate deal in April last year. He touched upon securing America more in terms of defence spendings, as well as saying that the anti-ISIS coalition has wrested almost 100 per cent of the territories once occupied by the Islamic State.  \r\n \r\n President Trump sounded more sober than his usual bombast, though the claims that he made on employment rates among Hispanics, African-Americans and women can be attributed to the policies of the previous Obama administration with its strong affirmative action push. Similarly, the state of the political economy could be gauged from the fact that on the first anniversary of Trump's swearing-in, there was a US government shutdown because the Congress couldn't agree on a federal budget. Not to mention the bad press that Trump is still getting nationally, with some seriously considering if he can be impeached. That said, the expected grouse against \"fake news\" and \"nasty\" media at a global platform was new for the WEF, even though Trump enjoyed a full house, like always. Trump's speech and later interaction with WEF head Klaus Schwab indicate clearly that his anti-immigration policies will continue unabated, making it increasingly difficult for foreign policy experts in India to negotiate a better deal for the expats and NRIs, increasingly courted back home by all political parties. Does Trump's speech ring alarm bells already? Yes, but they are not as loud as we had made them out to be. ","title":"'America First' doesn't mean 'America Alone': What Trump said at World Economic Forum","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/donald-trump-davos-world-economic-forum-2018-united-states-of-america/story/1/22009.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15299},{"author":"Amna Mirza","content":"Diplomatic relations with China have always been a thorny issue as far as India's global outreach programmes are concerned, especially in its efforts to reach out to neighbouring countries. At a time when the US, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has been hinting at  , China is trying to take centre stage with its globalisation plans. To understand how this Chinese stance impacts Indian interests, one must look at Beijing's engagement with neighbouring countries. It's an open secret that China is Pakistan's all-weather ally. However, of late, Beijing has been offering submarines to countries along the Indian Ocean coastlines at lucrative prices. Pakistan and China recently announced they will hold joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean regularly. Reports have also surfaced saying China's third domestic aircraft carrier is   in the Indian Ocean. It is pretty evident that Pakistan has consented to self-destruction by agreeing to be a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and trying to bypass the US' strategic encirclement policy that has a military base in Diego Garcia in Indian Ocean and includes the South China Sea. With Pakistan getting loans at exorbitantly high interest rates, imperialist loot and plunder is pretty evident. China has been pretty ruthless in this game of trying to shift the power balance in its own favour. China has invested several billion dollars in building sea lines of communication through Pakistan running far into the Indian Ocean. This is a difficult target to pursue, but that hasn't deterred China from actually going for it. China was critical of the US moving its   in the South China sea, calling it a violation of its sovereignty, and pledged to take necessary measures to protect the same. Beijing took this stand despite the fact that its ships and submarines keep surfacing near Japanese islands, near Taiwan and in the Indian Ocean. China's clout is not restricted to Pakistan, it is growing in the entire Asian region. The country's role in fomenting trouble in Maldives is well-known. Exiled Maldivian Opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed termed Chinese property deals in Maldives as \"land grab\". Chinese influence actually stretches to as far as Australia. It is being said that Beijing's rising display of might in South Asia is in response to India's outings in Southeast Asia. It is indeed great that India can work closely with other nations which are joined by the common thread of Chinese aggression in the region. New Delhi can especially draw support from member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Even though India has been mindful of the Chinese threat, it needs to shore up greater support given that the challenge from Beijing is growing increasingly formidable.","title":"India must forge deeper ties with ASEAN nations to counter China in Indian Ocean","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chinese-aggression-donald-trump-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-cpec-maldives-pakistan/story/1/21980.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15300},{"author":"Kaveree Bamzai","content":"That the right wing in India has no sense of history is being proven daily on the streets of cities across India as Karni Sena and its clones threaten the screening of  . They want to ban a movie they have not seen. And they want to protest the depiction of their clan though they do not know details of how it is portrayed. This is in keeping with their lack of knowledge of history. Or rather, as Audrey Truschke points out in an earlier  for  , the skewed colonial history that was taught to us all. As she notes: \"The story of how Aurangzeb became India’s most maligned king begins in the British colonial period. In brief, the British wanted to point to Indian rulers who were even worse than themselves in order to justify the horrors of colonialism. So they painted a skewed picture of Aurangzeb, often misrepresenting his alleged worst crimes. Many Hindu nationalists today think that hating Aurangzeb is a distinctively Indian feeling, but such sentiments are perhaps more aptly described as a colonial inheritance.\" For the right wing, Aurangzeb is seen as the epitome of everything evil. Not only do they see him as a destroyer of temples (though he built more temples than he destroyed), but also as the man who imposed the dreaded jizya tax and disliked music and art. In asking for the boycott of  , the RSS has shown that it is no less than Aurangzeb - they hate the very thing he is said to have abhorred. So, do we become what we hate most? It would seem so. No matter that Aurangzeb's name is sought to be erased by the BJP from Indian history (though he ruled quite successfully for almost half a century) and that no less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his name when he spoke disparagingly of Rahul Gandhi recently, he has become the epitome of what a \"bad Muslim\" can be. So, if we are to believe the history that has been taught to us, and is now forwarded through WhatsApps, we should assume the RSS and Karni Sena are Aurangzeb's true heirs. That is also not quite true though - music wasn’t proscribed even in Aurangzeb’s court. The emperor’s own coronation anniversaries were marked by both musicians and dancers. Not only that, his patronisation of music meant that a number of dhrupads were composed in his name. In the  , Bahktawar Khan wrote of the Emperor having a “perfect expert's knowledge” of music. In  , Alauddin Khilji is shown as feeding those pages of history to fire that don't bear his name. If history were to be rewritten to suit those in power, we would have as many versions of it as we have had rulers. Will burning buses and protesting at cinema halls change Rajput history? The irony is that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made a film that celebrates every virtue the Rajputs hold dear - including a very emotive sequence at the end when Rani Padmavati leads her army of women into the flames, choosing jauhar over falling into the arms of Khilji. Every community has its own idea of its special status. The Rajputs certainly are entitled to it - and, in fact, the movie celebrates that, with Ratan Singh saying \" ,   Rajput;   Rajput;   Rajput.\" If their objection is that the film portrays a sort of \"love jihad\", they couldn't be more wrong. Arjun Appadurai speaks of the \"fear of small numbers\", the idea that a small minority is standing in the way of a great people from fully embracing their nationalism. It is exactly what is happening here. Khilji's existence is supposed to stand in the way of Rajput's embracing their idea of who they are, or ought to be. Now if that is not a majoritarian mindset, what is? How does it make the Karni Sena or RSS any different from what they imagine Aurangzeb to have been?","title":"How are Rajput Karni Sena and RSS any different from what they imagine Aurangzeb to be?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karni-sena-violence-rss-padmaavat-aurangzeb-right-wing-vandalism-gurgaon-school-bus/story/1/21976.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15301},{"author":"Siddharth Singh","content":"The   has released the US National Defence Strategy last week, shifting its focus, for the first time in over a decade, from fighting terror to preparing for what it believes is a threat from  and  . The National Defence Strategy (NDS) is an important document which encapsulates the Trump administration’s defence policies in one place for the first time. The NDS bluntly describes a US military that is losing its edge over potential competitors, and urges “increased and sustained investment” for “long-term strategic competitions specifically with China and Russia”. The NDS also identifies three theatres of engagement for the US: the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the West Asia that is consistent with what the Obama administration had been doing towards the end. While the NDS specifically points out that “China is a strategic competitor which is using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbours while militarising features in the South China Sea”, the document blames Russia of violating the borders of nearby nations and pursuing veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbours. The unclassified synopsis of NDS 2018 acknowledges an increasingly complex global security environment, characterised by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations. The NDS states in clear terms about growing Chinese hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and states on China \"continues its economic and military ascendance, asserting power through an all-of-nation long-term strategy, it will continue to pursue a military modernization programme that seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global pre-eminence in the future”. The Trump administration had also released its first National Security Strategy (NSS) last month on December 18, 2017. In principle, the strategy which has been outlined in the NSS document charts out the strategic objectives of Trump’s administration and also the ways to meet those strategic aims. The NSS document describes the Indo-Pacific region as the most populous and economically dynamic part of the world and maps it as a stretch from the west coast of India to the western shores of the United States and reinforces its commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance with international law in the Indo-Pacific region. The NSS reflects a growing consensus in the US that China is an adversary. The document is a frank acknowledgment of widely shared concerns about China’s rise. It is important here to note that the approach of Trump administration is a far cry from the Obama administration’s 2015 NSS which had welcomed the rise of a “peaceful” and “prosperous” China. In future, a sharp deterioration of China-US ties cannot be ruled out, especially if Washington perceives Beijing as a hindrance when it comes to resolving the crisis in the Korean Peninsula. The Trump administration’s complaint of China’s bullying of other States using “economic inducements and penalties, influence operations, and implied military threats,” echoes fears spreading from Asia to Europe. In the Indo-Pacific region, as far as New Delhi is concerned, the NSS “welcomes India’s emergence as a leading global power and stronger strategic and defence partner”. On the future course of action in the bilateral partnership between the US and India, the document mentions that the US will expand its defence and security cooperation with India which is a major defence partner of the United States, and will also support India’s growing relationships throughout the Indo-Pacific region. There is a specific mention in the document of the much-talked and debated “quadrilateral partnership” among the US, Japan, India and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region, and the NSS puts its stamp on it by mentioning the “Quad” for \"free and open Indo-Pacific\". On the issue of maritime cooperation, Washington has time and again shown its willingness to deepen its strategic partnership with New Delhi and support India’s leadership role in Indian Ocean security and throughout the broader region which is reflective in the cooperation in the Malabar naval exercise. Terrorism in South Asia is one of the biggest challenges among other geopolitical issues and in a direct reference to it, the NSS states that “the US will press Pakistan to intensify the counterterrorism efforts, since no partnership can survive a country’s support for militants and terrorists who target a partner’s own service members and officials”. Overall, the hypothesis of the NSS is based on the principle of realism in international relations as it defines the international system as one of great power competition in which the document specifically points out about Russia and China and portray them as “revisionist powers” challenging the status quo and identifies both the nations as strategic competitors or opponents of the United States. The NSS also criticises past several decades of US foreign policy approach and points out that in past it was shaped by the misguided belief that \"engagement with rivals and their inclusion in international institutions and global commerce would turn them into benign actors and trustworthy partners\". This kind of realist framework in the conceptual context needs to be welcomed because it was long overdue departure from previous and successive administrations of the US. Interestingly, the NSS neither makes any mention of China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative nor mentions about the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which together has the potential for a parallel Sino-centric sphere of influence in future. The US needs to shed its obsession with zero-sum trade reciprocity and should come out with a coherent and comprehensive geo-economics strategy if it wants to preserve the US-led rules-based order and counter China’s grand strategy to carve out a parallel Sino-centric order or sphere of influence.  ","title":"What Trump's new national defence and security strategies mean for India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/us-national-defence-strategy-security-india-us-ties-defence-trump-obama-administration/story/1/21979.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15302},{"author":"Minhaz Merchant","content":"The   between the chief justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and four Supreme Court collegium justices - J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph - gets curiouser by the day. Despite several meetings to reconcile their differences, the gulf between India’s seniormost justices has not narrowed. What precisely are those differences? At their press conference and in their seven-page letter, the four collegium justices were vague in their demands. For those who want linguistic clarity and brevity from our finest judicial minds, the letter gives little indication of either. Sample this: “ But if all Supreme Court justices are equals, why shouldn’t cases, sensitive or not, be assigned to benches led by “junior” Supreme Court judges? No clear answer has been forthcoming. So what do the four rebel justices really want? First, they want the case relating to the death of judge BH Loya reassigned. That wish has been fulfilled. Justice Arun Mishra was hearing the Loya case. Rattled by the events of last week, he recused himself. The CJI, in a show of authority, reassigned the case to a bench headed by himself. He was under relentless pressure to reassign the Loya case to a bench headed by one of the four collegium justices. He did not. Instead, he even transferred the two PILs related to the case pending in the Bombay High Court to his own bench. Last week, the petitioners’ senior counsel Dushyant Dave had pleaded “with folded hands” against the CJI doing that. The CJI brushed aside Dave’s plea. A group of lawyers and politicians are using the  , as they had earlier used the  , to target BJP president Amit Shah. The confrontation between the Maharashtra government’s counsel Harish Salve and Dave in the CJI’s court on January 22, brought this out into the open. Dave claimed that Salve had defended Shah in the past and should not appear in the Loya case due to conflict of interest. The charge was summarily rejected by the CJI’s three-judge bench.   Salve has, meanwhile, submitted medical documents and other material to the Supreme Court to show that judge Loya’s death occurred due to natural causes. The CJI has posted the next hearing in the case for February 2. But amid the judge Loya clamour, the case that lurks in the background is about building the  . Like Banquo’s ghost that haunted Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the Ram temple case haunts the Supreme Court. The long drawn-out case is now with a bench headed by the CJI. He retires on October 2, 2018. There is an expectation that the CJI wants to deliver a verdict in the case before he demits office. The same powerful group of lawyers, activists, politicians and sections of the media that has shown exceptional interest in the judge Loya case fears that the CJI could be inclined to rule in favour of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque stood. Such a ruling would benefit the BJP in three big states due to go to the polls in December 2018: Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. All three states will feature binary BJP-Congress contests. All three face strong anti-incumbency. A pro-temple ruling would give the BJP a steroid boost ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election.  Two outcomes can now be divined. First, a chastened CJI, buffeted by the collegium’s rebellion, will postpone a verdict on the Ram temple case till after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, citing its sensitivity. Second, the CJI could rule against  building the Ram temple where the Babri mosque stood and instead suggest the construction of two new structures, a temple and a mosque, side by side. That would suit the Opposition ahead of 2019. All of these well-laid plans though may amount to nothing. Even if the Supreme Court’s verdict goes against building the Ram temple, or the verdict is inordinately delayed, the anger that it will spark among devout Hindus will be electorally fissile. In the end, therefore, the elaborate shenanigans we have been witness to in the Supreme Court over the past two weeks could end in a whimper. But the spotlight it has shone on the apex court and its hallowed innards will have served a purpose.  Why, for example, haven’t the senior justices of the Supreme Court shown similar ire, as they have over assignment of cases, against the real issues that bedevil India’s judicial system: deep-seated corruption, shambolic infrastructure, a mounting backlog of cases, lawyers holding clients to ransom with adjournments, and the opaque collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court by other Supreme Court judges? Such opacity hardly inspires confidence in India’s top judicial minds as they wrestle with the fissure within their ranks and Banquo’s ghost that hovers silently over the unbuilt Ram temple in Ayodhya.","title":"Why Ram temple issue is lurking behind crisis in Supreme Court","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-judge-loya-ram-mandir-2019-modi-amit-shah-congress/story/1/21953.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15303},{"author":"Aruna Chandrasekhar","content":"Given the surreal times that we live in, it's always reassuring to hear world leaders reaffirm that climate change is still real for them. This time it was   at Davos, acknowledging climate change as one of the biggest threats to the world as we know it.  It was a statement in keeping with India's strong positioning as a climate leader and doing more than it should. But that we are bending over backwards to set ambitious climate goals - given our history as being a site of colonial pillage - is a point I wish he drove home without constantly having to bring yoga into it.  Sustainable lifestyles make for great soft power sell at Davos, but not when you are the world's second-largest coal consumer and third-largest emitter, with a capital that's not particularly conducive to \"pranayama\".

I wish he'd spoken of the impacts closer home -  , caught off guard by  , agrararian suicides in a year where average rainfall dropped five per cent and devastating floods that took over a thousand lives in the sub-continent.

Over 200 coal projects - many of them greenfield - still lie on the top of his office's  . It was only because of a case filed by air pollution activist Sunil Dahiya that    have been put on hold, unless they comply with new emission norms. Dahiya is a campaigner with Greenpeace, an organisation the present government has relentlessly persecuted for calling out the excesses of coal culture. Modi's call for rich nations to do their bit and arguments against protectionism struck the right notes, as developed countries must demonstrate they can put their money where their mouth is, beginning with their commitments to the Kyoto Protocol which turned 20 last year. India deserves, and is due to all, the finance and technology in helping it fulfil its most daring gigwatt goals, and to build climate adaptation capacity. But this must be finance that is easy to access. To win a project under  , for instance, is nearly impossible, making one wonder what Make In India the government is hoping to seed fund from its unique carbon tax. While the international press saw Modi's protectionism diatribe as directly   America-centricism - the latest being a 30 per cent tariff imposed on foreign-made solar cells and modules - the Indian government is currently mulling imposing one, putting Operation Suryanamaskar's success in peril. For Modi to invoke Mahatma Gandhi's spin on natural resources while making an elevator pitch at Davos was a stretch even by his standards. For one, his government's continued expansion of Coal India's mines towards a 1.5 billion target has been the opposite of the kid-glove-meets-swadeshi kind of trusteeship,   to forcibly grab indigenous land, while  that allow for local trustees to have any say in the matter. Two, his government's coal auction regime has not been a vast improvement, with ghosts of cartelisation returning, conflicts around land and pollution that were never   and mines unable to get off the ground. Instead, contract mining has become the default way to go, with the state taking on the bidding and regulatory prep work, while private miners like the   rake in the profits without the exposure. By the looks of it, neither   nor   have benefitted the least from three and a half years of Modi's custodianship. If Modi really wants Davos and the world to believe in India taking the lead on climate change, he needs to shed his telling proximity to the fossil fuel industry, acknowledge and fix the haze at home, announce the no-go zones in India's forests and wetland buffers, strengthen laws that empower communities with the lowest carbon footprint and make clean energy R&D accessible, without doing away with essential laws and protections.  All else is \"pawanmuktasana\" for the international press.","title":"Why Prime Minister Modi's talk of climate change in Davos was hogwash","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/davos-pm-modi-climate-yoga-change-pollution-trump-indias-coal-culture-clean-energy/story/1/21948.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15304},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"Uddhav Thackeray was searching for a “villain” he could blame for the Shiv Sena’s decision to go solo in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He found one in the form of BJP national president Amit Shah. Thackeray claims that Shah sidelined the other constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) while setting a target of 380 seats for the next Lok Sabha election. “Why the astonishment over Shiv Sena’s stand to go solo in the elections?” Thackeray asked in party mouthpiece   on January 24. Thackeray compares the Shiv Sena with the army of Maratha emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji: “The Maratha warrior didn’t worry about the vast empires of the Muslim rulers, their unlimited sources of wealth even though he himself didn’t have enough money to pay his army men.” However, it seems he has not taken lessons from Shivaji’s guerrilla war tactics. True to his impulsive nature, Thackeray has revealed his strategy much before the country can go into the election mode. He has given the BJP ample time to formulate its strategy ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election without his party’s support. Interestingly, it was the BJP that had kept Thackeray in the dark about the future of their alliance when the former had unilaterally announced a break up two days before the nomination for Assembly polls began in September 2014. “A mature leader never lets his rivals know his strategy much in advance. Uddhavji should have waited for some time,” says a Shiv Sena leader. Voters will not trust Thackeray’s intention to take on the BJP until he proves his credibility by quitting the coalition government. His criticism regarding the government’s failure on issues like loan waiver to farmers will not carry weight till he remains a key player of the government. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have begun chiding him for sticking to power rather than dismantling the alliance. Traditionally, the Thackerays are not known to be open-hearted. Shiv Sena workers are not sure whether they will get monetary support from the party for their work during elections. Around six months ago, the Shiv Sena had fielded Tanaji Sawant, a wealthy Mumbai-based businessman, in the Legislative Council elections from the faraway Yavatmal constituency, declining loyal but poor workers the opportunity to contest polls. Sawant secured a comfortable victory that upset party loyalists. Bring this into the equation, and it is highly possible Thackeray will choose candidates with money instead of those who have been toiling for the party for many years. Ordinary Shiv Sena workers have gone into political hibernation since Thackeray joined the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in December 2014. The chief does not have any programme to infuse enthusiasm into them. The moment any Shiv Sena worker expresses his dissent over the functioning of the government, a patent question is thrown at him: why is he complaining if he is a part of the government? The Shiv Sainiks have been caught in a Catch-22 situation. They feel they are in the government but the BJP has ensured that they do not get any benefit of the power. Thackeray will have to come up with a detailed roadmap to revive the party — at present, he does not have any. Thackeray has announced that Shiv Sena will contest elections in every state on the Hindutva plank. The ground reality, however, paints no rosy picture. In Maharashtra, north Indians and Gujaratis will vote for the BJP on the Hindutva plank as the Shiv Sena has time and again taken a hard stand against these communities. For north Indians, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is a bigger Hindutva icon than Thackeray. The Gujaratis do not consider anyone Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s equal — he remains the biggest Hindutva idol. The Marathi-speaking voters, on the other hand, will rally behind the Shiv Sena as they are divided in other parties — BJP, Congress and the NCP. It is important to note that Hindutva supporters disapprove of Thackeray’s growing closeness with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee whom they consider anti-Hindutva owing to her politics of appeasement. The Shiv Sena is not a dominant force outside the Konkan and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra. In Mumbai, it will have a close contest with the BJP should the two parties fight the polls separately. Thackeray has failed to take Shiv Sena to new heights in western Maharashtra, north Maharashtra and Vidarbha, the regions where half of the Assembly seats are consolidated. Uddhav’s decision to go solo in the election is certainly aimed at energising depressed Shiv Sena workers, but it will not get him sweeping power. Who will he blame then?","title":"Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to go without BJP in 2019 general elections will be disastrous","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uddhav-thackeray-shiv-sena-lok-sabha-elections-2019-maharashtra/story/1/21949.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15305},{"author":"TS Sudhir","content":"The   could well be mistaken for the latest season of \"MasterChef Karnataka\". What else explains the obsession of both the Congress and the BJP to reduce the political battle to all things culinary? At a time when the man on the street is grappling with bread and butter issues, the political cooks are serving him beef biryani instead. The B-word was introduced into the Kannada electoral lexicon by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who many in the BJP believe is the man who could ensure distribution of laddoos on verdict day in May 2018. He slammed his Karnataka counterpart Siddaramaiah, mocking his Hindu self, deriding his choice to   despite his religious identity. The Congress hit back with a video that spoke of how Yogi is a recipe that the BJP has prepared to stir trouble in Karnataka. The video made references to the criminal cases against Yogi and the BJP was not amused. Plagiarism is the name of the game so a week later, the BJP too chose the same culinary metaphor to show Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Congress working president Dinesh Gundu Rao as chefs, out to prepare beef biryani. The ingredients in this case, according to the makers of the video, included \"illegal beef from a slaughterhouse\", \"rotten rice\" given as part of the PDS, the inability to solve the Cauvery and Mahadayi river water sharing crisis, killings of Hindu youths and alleged corruption in the building of a steel flyover in Bengaluru. But the real reason behind calling it \"beef biryani\" was to stress the appeasement of the minorities under Siddaramaiah. On Monday, the Congress beefed up its rhetoric by expanding the BJP to \"Beef Janata Party\", inspired from Gabbar Singh Tax, perhaps. The attempt was to expose the hypocrisy of the BJP which adopts different positions on consumption of beef in different states. For example, while it does not breathe a word about its anti-beef position in a beef-consuming Meghalaya that goes to polls next month, it wants to put the Congress on the mat in Karnataka by making it a poll issue. The video also spoke of Goa that under BJP's Manohar Parrikar wants to import beef and UP's BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who reportedly runs a meat processing unit. The reason for the BJP raising the decibel levels over its love for the cow goes back five years, when the party was in power in Karnataka. In 2010, the then BJP government had passed the Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill. Siddaramaiah, then in the Opposition had dramatically torn a copy of the Bill, accusing Yeddyurappa of behaving like \"Hitler's regime\" and \"imposing a vegetarian\" culture on the people of Karnataka. His argument was that by banning beef, mutton would become prohibitive. Three years later, when Siddaramaiah became CM, one of his first decisions was to overturn the beef ban. The 1964 Cattle Preservation Act was restored under which slaughter of cows, calves and buffaloes was banned. The Yeddyurappa Bill had banned the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and imposed harsh punishments for violators of the law. By making beef a poll issue, the BJP wants to jog the memory of voters on Siddaramaiah's conduct, hoping to sway the vegetarian Kannadiga and the orthodox Hindu on to its side. This is because even while standing his ground on his right to decide what food will be on his plate, Siddaramaiah has emphasised that he is  . \"There is both Siddha and Rama in my name,'' he declared, raising the spectre of a Gujarat-like temple run in Karnataka by the Congress led by Rahul Gandhi. The Congress, having seen the results of running a Hindu-ised Gujarat campaign, wants to ensure the BJP does not pitch its tent as the sole spokesperson of the Hindus in Karnataka. The BJP's assessment is that controversial planks like beef ban will find traction in pockets of Karnataka, especially the communally sensitive coastal belt. The intention also is to provoke the Muslim voices in the Congress to speak up, so that it will give the BJP a chance to label the ruling party as batting solely for the minorities. So far, the Congress has ensured it does not fall into the trap, trying instead to pick holes in the BJP's policy of different strokes in different states. But what is certain is that the beef recipe will only bring a divisive election on the menu and that won't do Karnataka any good.","title":"BJP vs Congress: Who will get the beef recipe right in Karnataka polls?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/karnataka-elections-siddaramaiah-yogi-adityanath-beef-ban-bjp-congress/story/1/21918.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15306},{"author":"Valay Singh Rai","content":"At a dimly lit internet cafe in one of the several urban villages of Delhi, two Class 12 students, sporting latest hairstyles and faux designer labels, are getting their school projects printed. Sushant’s submission is on the Goods and Services Tax (GST); his friend Sumit struggles to translate his project title into English. The irritable cafe owner is in a hurry to move on to his other customers. “Write the title in Hindi -   (the crisis of unemployment),” Sumit tells him.  The boys study in a government school in south Delhi’s Swamy Nagar, a posh neighbourhood that houses many of the 1 per cent Indians who have come to acquire 73 per cent of the wealth generation in India in 2017. The boys on the other hand belong to the 14-18 years age group that constitute 11 per cent (100.2 million) of India’s population of 1.2 billion people. They form a huge chunk of our much-touted (and neglected) demographic dividend of 390 million millennials and the 12 million young people who join the workforce every year. A week ago, the   (ASER) was released by Pratham. Titled \"Beyond Basics\", the latest report is a welcome departure from the past as it looks at rural youth in 14-18 age group, through the lenses of - activity, ability, awareness, and aspirations. Earlier, ASER reports have brought out in stark detail the poor learning levels of children in the schooling system. It is thanks to this annual survey, we now know that while school enrolment has gone up to more than 95 per cent, learning levels of children in government schools are woeful. Most Class 3 students are unable to Class 2-level text. The findings of \" \" are a stinging slap to policymakers and state governments of the 24 states that formed part of the    The worst indictment is for the union government, which has been stubbornly resisting the extension of the Right to Education Act from 14 years to 18 years.  So far, only primary school education in India is a legal right, which is why primary school enrolments have shot up to more than 90 per cent. Groups like the   have been demanding that secondary school education should also be made a legal right as most children tend to \"drop out\" after Class 8. The latest survey confirms once again that the urgent need is to make the entire 12 years of schooling a legal right. The survey has thrown up worrisome trends that belie the media frenzy over Skill India, Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India, and Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat. Consider this: Out of 100 children in Class 7 only half of them continue to study till Class 10. And only 25 per cent of them go on to complete Class 12. Less than 10 per cent of the youth surveyed in the \"Beyond Basics\" report were enrolled in undergraduate or other degree courses. Nearly 30 per cent of all youth are not enrolled in either a school or any other educational course. The prime minister, who is in   to tell the world’s business tycoons that \"India means business\" ought to bear in mind the complete failure of his government’s Skill India programme. According to the ASER report, only 5 per cent of youth are \"taking some type of vocational training or other courses\". Just 5 per cent. That’s less than the proportion of such youth in Sri Lanka and Nepal, leave alone the rest of the world. For the RSS and its supporters, the ancient golden age of \"Bharat\" is an ever-present model to attract ordinary Indians to their fold. \"India will once again become the world’s teacher\" - this promise is often heard from RSS men, BJP leaders and ministers alike. While a lie can possibly be turned into truth by repeating it ad nauseam, the same doesn’t hold true for grand promises. Last year, the central government  . This month, the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE) once again stalled the demand for the extension of the RTE Act. Moreover, there is a shortage of 9.4 lakh teachers in government schools where the poorest children study. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, only half of all secondary school teacher posts have been filled. In Bihar and Gujarat, one third of them are vacant. Among the other alarming findings of the ASER report is the abysmal \"awareness\" level of India’s rural youth. Less than half of them were unable to locate their own state on the map. Only 64 per cent of them knew that Delhi is India’s capital and nearly 14 per cent of them didn’t recognise India’s map. The prime minister, especially believes in the power of apps and internet, but again, the bulk of India’s youth are deprived of access to the new knowledge-based economy. The   says that  only \"28 per cent had used the internet and 26 per cent had used computers in the last week, while 59 per cent had never used a computer and 64 per cent had never used internet\". If we divide this on the basis of gender, we find that girls are lagging in internet usage also. The report found that, “while 49 per cent  of males have never used the internet, close to 76 per cent of females have never done so”. The proportion of mobile phone users was predictably higher at 73 per cent for all youth, here too more females (22 per cent) had never used a mobile phone as compared to males (12 per cent). If a \"Beyond Basics\" kind of survey is conducted among the youth who scaled the court complex in Udaipur and planted a saffron flag in the wake of the gruesome communal murder of migrant labourer Afrazul, the results are likely to be in consonance with the general findings of the actual report. Incidentally, Udaipur was the only district where the survey was conducted in Rajasthan. The findings for Udaipur are depressing, 96.8 per cent of the youth surveyed were not enrolled in any vocational course, less than half of them could do basic arithmetic, or recognise their own state on the map of India. This pattern repeats itself across different states. The crux of the ASER survey is clear. Most of India’s youth are uneducated, deprived of access to skills of the future, and live in abject hopelessness. In the absence of free and compulsory education till Class 12, many of the rural youth are forced to discontinue their education over reasons ranging from death in the family to the wedding of a sibling even as education is prioritised over practically everything in middle class Indian families. The whole family works in mission mode to ensure that their children ace their competitive exams and join a professional course, while the laggards make up by buying seats in colleges. On the other hand, in the other India which lives in villages and small towns, the youth lives in a deep and dark well which is illuminated by TV and mobile phones. In the absence of role models (40 per cent said they have none), their lives are a dark vacuum which can be easily filled by destructive, if not exhilarating purposes. The demographic dividend is real and inevitable, but are we as a country prepared to constructively engage the youth is the question that should be bothering our government? Because if the government continues to look at school education as business as usual, and ignore education, skills and employability of the future Indian workforce, then the demographic dividend will surely turn into a demographic disaster.","title":"India's demographic dividend is turning into a disaster","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/modi-demographic-dividend-aser-education-slap-davos-skill-india-rte/story/1/21919.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15307},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"When he was inducted into the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government in 2014, Chandrakant Patil was considered a man for all seasons because of his ability to handle a number of issues besides his clean image. Three and a half years later, the revenue minister has become the epitome of goof-ups and misplaced priorities. Most recently, Patil found himself at the centre of controversy when he recited a Kannada song praising Karnataka, where he attended the inauguration of a Durga temple in Belgaum district. Patil opened his speech with \"Huttidare Kannada Nadalli Huttabeku (roughly translated as \"One should be born in Karnataka if one is born at all\")\". As expected, the Opposition is demanding Patil’s head for “insulting Maharashtra in Karnataka”. The controversy assumes political relevance owing to Maharashtra's long-pending border dispute with Karnataka. Belgaum is the centrepoint of the chorus for the demand for the merger of Karnataka’s Marathi-speaking border areas with Maharashtra. Patil has effectively given the Opposition an opportunity to target the state government for its “double standards” over the decades-old issue. “We were aware of the BJP’s affection for Gujarat. Now, it has developed love for Karnataka. Chandrakant Patil has stabbed the people of Maharashtra in the back,” said Nationalist Congress Party leader Ajit Pawar. He even asked for the minister's resignation in a tweet. \r\n \r\n Patil has become a habitual offender when it comes to breaking Marathi hearts. Only two weeks ago, he had raised questions over the competence of BJP workers in the state. Speaking at a conclave of teachers in Beed, Patil had said it had become difficult to find leaders of character for various important posts in the party. “We won’t find such people even if we look for them with binoculars,” he had said, in an apparent dig at \"incompetent\" BJP workers. He had also found himself in a spot in October 2017 when he provided wrong information about the ownership of two flats in the possession of state Congress president Ashok Chavan’s daughters – Shrijaya and Sujaya. While he has apologised to BJP workers over his remarks in Beed, Patil clarified that he spoke in Kannada recently as the native audience could grasp only that language.  The goof-ups are likely to hamper his political career, considered bright till a couple of months ago. A smear campaign has already been conducted within the BJP to curtail Patil’s phenomenal political growth. He was an office-bearer at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Kolhapur office till 2010, when the BJP inducted him full time and made him contest the legislative council election from the graduates’ constituency. Patil secured a comfortable victory but kept a low profile, following his Sangh ideals. His stature in the party started growing since Amit Shah became BJP's national president. Both of them share very good relations since Shah’s wife comes from Patil’s hometown Kolhapur. Patil has had close ties with Shah’s in-laws since his days in the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in late '80s. He became number two in the Fadnavis Cabinet following the ouster of then revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who was the party's most senior face. On at least three occasions, when there were speculations over Fadnavis being replaced as the CM, Patil emerged as a frontrunner for the coveted post. First, it was the outcry of the Maratha community demanding reservation in education and government jobs. Later, the unprecedented agitation by farmers demanding a better price for their produce and, recently, the protests by Dalits following clashes at Bhima Koregaon on January 1 made Patil feel that he stood a chance to lead Maharashtra in the event Fadnavis is asked to step down for “mishandling” the crisis. It created the impression that Patil, a Maratha, could succeed Fadnavis, a Brahmin. The situation has rapidly changed and an impulsive Patil alone is responsible for that. He has become the target of detractors within the BJP. A source in the party claims that a whispering campaign has been engineered over Patil’s caste. Some have started circulating a message that says Patil is a Jain not a Maratha. It points out that there are many Jains in western Maharashtra, especially in Kolhapur and Sangli, who carry Marathi surnames like Patil. That Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, the founder of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha, a major education trust in Sangli, was a Jain. The message asks what Chandrakant Patil has done for the welfare of Maratha students as the head of a committee constituted to deal with issues pertaining to the community, such as reservation and scholarships. If the message is an indication, it is the beginning of the decline of Patil’s influence.","title":"Why Chandrakant Patil is facing the heat in Maharashtra BJP","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/chandrakant-patil-kannada-belgaum-devendra-fadnavis-maharashtra-bjp-rss/story/1/21920.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15308},{"author":"Subhash Kak","content":"There was an outcry in the Indian media last week when  , minister of state for human resource development, reportedly said: \"Darwin's theory (of evolution) is scientifically wrong. It needs to change in school and college curriculum. Since the man is seen on earth, he has always been a man.\" He was speaking to reporters in Aurangabad at the All India Vaidik Sammelan. He reportedly added: \"Nobody - including our ancestors - has said they saw an ape turning into a man. No books we have read or the tales told to us by our grandparents had such a mention.\" Indian scientists are shocked that the minister should speak thus against the idea of evolution which is fundamental to biology and medicine. How can the HRD minister be so ill-informed about science? This is all the more puzzling since he was a senior police officer before entering politics. Was the minister merely trying to be nice to the traditionalists at the Vaidik Sammelan, and he has no strong views on the matter, and perhaps the HRD ministry is safe under his leadership? My own thinking is that he is genuinely misinformed because, in reality, the idea of evolution (more general than Darwinian Evolution) is basic to all Indian thought, which is something that he does not appear to know. The least he can do is to understand both modern evolution theory and Indian ideas on it and then see how the education system in India can help people know the history of Indian ideas as well as the foundations of modern science. The Sankhya is the Indian theory of evolution, which is supposed to apply both to the individual and the cosmos. In it, the basic entities are pure consciousness and materiality (nature). Nature has three constituent qualities (gunas) called sattva, rajas, and tamas, and as the balance between these three changes the universe evolves. Out of the interplay of the five basic elements arise other principles (tattva): five subtle elements, five action senses, five senses of perception, mind, egoity, and intellect. The evolutionary sequence goes through many levels. The tattvas help in the emergence of life out of inert matter. The gu?as are not to be taken as abstract principles alone. Indian thought believes that structure in nature is recursive, and the gu?as show up in various forms at different levels of expression. The texts imply that ingredients for the growth of life are available throughout the universe. Infinite number of universes are conceived, so each new one is created like a bubble in an ocean of bubbles. The tattvas are not discrete and their varying expression creates the diversity of life in and across leading different species. Each sensory and motor tattva is mapped into a corresponding organ. Indian thought conceives of 8.4 million species, which is an impressive number, considering modern authorities estimate the number of extant species to be 4.5-10 million. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger thought that the S?nkhyan tattvas were the most plausible model for the evolution of the sensory organs. A quote on evolution on earth from the thousand-year-old, encyclopedic Yoga Vasistha (YV): Indicating the presence of other animals while the giant asuras were on earth, YV suggests that man arose later. YV also speaks of minor ages of destruction on earth that correspond to the yugas. The Indians believed that all life can be divided into three classes (Chandogya Upanishad 6.3.1): \"In truth, beings have here three kinds of seeds, born from the egg, born alive, and born from the germ.\" Given that it is also affirmed that life on other planets exists and that there was a gradual rise of life on the earth, it would appear that this implied a belief in a panspermia theory. Why aren't Indian ideas on evolution known to educated Indians? We see that Satyapal Singh did not need to deny evolution just to be on the right side of the remembered Indian tradition. The question then is: Why are the minister and other Indians ill-informed about their own sciences? India is the only major nation where history of science is not integrated in the school and college curriculum. People pick up bits and pieces on it from a variety of sources, such as tangential references in religious texts, and other sources many of which are unreliable or plain wrong. Superstitions arise in the absence of right knowledge and sunlight dispels darkness. A course on history of Indian science in colleges and universities will go a long way in presenting Indian scientific ideas to the next generation, and help people distinguish scientific ideas from mythology and fiction. The history of Indian science is not a politically divisive issue as it is not teaching religion or ritual. Why can't the HRD ministry take leadership on this issue?","title":"What Hindu tradition says about evolution","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/satyapal-singh-human-evolution-apes-scientific-thought-chandogya-upanishad/story/1/21888.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15309},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"The Supreme Court on Friday decided that the judgment given in the Mahmood Farooqui case by the Delhi High Court is a  . The top court, comprising a bench of justices SA Bobde and L Nageshwar Rao,   of the American scholar against the high court judgment which acquitted Farooqui of rape charges, on the first hearing itself. While acquitting Farooqui, the Delhi High Court had controversially said, \"Sometimes a feeble no, means yes.\" There was much hope pinned on the apex court when the matter reached its door. In a hearing that lasted about 20 minutes, some observations and questions raised by the Supreme Court bench were deeply troubling. Here is a short account of the hearing because I was present in the courtroom: It began with the bench pointing out how the two (Farooqui and the woman) weren't strangers to each other. Justice Bobde observed, \"She knows him [Farooqui] well enough to make a drink for him.\" The bench went on to question the lawyer, \"How many times did the complainant visit the house of Farooqui alone.\" The court referred to an earlier incident when the complainant and Farooqui kissed despite the presence of Farooqui's wife in the house. The bench mistakenly thought that the incident is of the same day, but advocate Vrinda Grover informed that the instance of kissing did not happen on the day of the incident. The bench went into a discussion on whether the complainant faked an orgasm which could have led Farooqui to believe that she gave her consent. The bench asked: \"So, how did she communicate that she didn't have the  ? The lawyer responded by saying that the complainant said no several times. The judge interjected by saying, \"Initially yes, but later there is a response wherein she says she faked (orgasm). People give fake smiles all the time. But how could the alleged accused know it was fake. She said she was afraid but what she did was completely contrary to someone who would be afraid.\" The court insisted Vrinda Grover read the email written by the complainant to the accused after the incident, which talks about how the complainant felt her sexual autonomy is violated, how Farooqui became forceful and how she \"went along\" because she was scared. The complainant also told Farooqui how his behaviour was inappropriate and went on to say, \"I love you and wish well for you but..\" The court picked on this line: \"Ms Grover in how many cases have you seen the victim saying I love you to the accused.\" The lawyer tried to explain how it happens in cases where parties have known each other and victims are still coming to terms with their trauma. The court dismissed the plea. There are two grounds on which the court primarily dismissed the appeal against the high court judgment. The first was whether the absence of consent was properly communicated to Mahmood Farooqui as the parties were known to each other and had a history of kissing each other. The apex court seems to believe that because the complainant faked an orgasm towards the end of the sexual activity, it gave the defendant a presumption of consent. This argument is flawed. First, if the complainant had repeatedly   when the sexual activity began then faking an orgasm at the end cannot be conclusive proof that she consented. Consent in law is understood as the ability and freedom to make choices. The victim says she feared for her safety hence she \"went along\". This issue was dealt with in case of Doyle (2010) by the Court of Appeal in UK. The court came to the conclusion that the fact that the victim \"just let him get on with it\" was held to be no consent as there was a fear of harm. In this case one can argue that the fear of harm was not immediate. Most common law countries follow this proposition. One can of course debate whether the threat of harm was immediate or imminent or whether the complainant was reasonable in holding such a belief. But the mere faking of an orgasm towards the end cannot be conclusive for Farooqui to reach the conclusion that she consented. Let's move to the aspect of the proximity or the relationship between the parties. Both knew each other and had exchanged kisses earlier. But the past sexual conduct cannot be at any stage adduced as evidence for consent unless it can be directly established that it impinges upon the right of fair trial for the defendant. The test for adducing the evidence of past sexual conduct is pretty high even under the Indian law. It cannot be brought forth in ordinary circumstances, at least the law doesn't say so. In such a scenario for the bench to make observations like \"she knew him well enough to make a drink for him\" or \"how many times she visited the house alone\" raise some disturbing questions. I wonder, whether the sexuality of a woman continues to be on trial. The bench did clarify that they were not implying that making a drink or visiting someone's house gives one the right to rape, but having such questions is in itself problematic in a deeply violent and patriarchal society. The language used in a rape trial is an important component in the entire process of delivery of justice. At no point did the court delve into the fact that the defendant was intoxicated. Was he capable of understanding the verbal and non-verbal cues of the complainant? Why wasn't the conduct of the defendant who was arguably in a position of trust not questioned at any point? Now to the second and more disturbing aspect, which is of the email sent on March 30, 2015, two days after the incident. It is true that the complainant does say that \"I love you…\" but here is the full text of that email:  (Source: Judgment of Delhi HC). Few days later, on April 12, 2015, the complainant writes another mail which literally abuses Farooqui for the trauma and pain and how the experience has been haunting her ever since. These mails should be understood in the proper context. This is an account of a woman who is still coming to terms with what has happened with her. As women, we often deny our realities unless they start haunting us. This is very well documented especially in cases where the victim and offender have known each other.

This is not about a lawyer weighing her each and every words, imagining this to be used as evidence in court, but rather a woman who is finding it difficult to accept the reality in the wake of a saexual assault. Eventually it is for the courts to decide whether there was consent or not and yes the case of Farooqui is a difficult one. But the case has to be dismissed or admitted for the right reasons and in cases of sexual assault one can't ignore the language of it.

With the one-of-a-kind American president in Donald J Trump, whose protectionist   motto is exactly the opposite of what WEF has stood for, there’s bound to be “clashes”, if not among personalities, at least among competing ideas at the forum in the snow-clad Swiss Alps, despite the   on the mountains, thanks to India. With both Modi and Trump scheduled to give keynote addresses – Modi at the opening plenary session on   and Trump on the last day,   – it seems the organisers have tried their best to avoid awkwardness, and any hijacking of the forum by Trump with his anti-globalist ideas. While there have been protests against WEF by the anti-globalisation activists of the left, environmentalists, anti-capitalists from Europe and Latin America, the concern about Trump is unique, since it’s the US president this time, usually a force of globalisation and undeterred flow of global capital, who is spewing policies and ideas that are clearly in the “far-right” of the socioeconomic spectrum. On the other hand, despite immense criticism at home, Prime Minister Modi, who’s the first Indian PM to make an official trip to Davos after two decades since former   went in 1997, stands for pitching India as a global investment destination, even though it’s not going to be the easiest of tasks. With the investment-to-GDP ratio dipping at home, and the economic indicators that were paraded by the government, such as the   and the World Bank  , both having faced  , thereby stealing Modi’s thunder somewhat with hard data, the task has become more uphill. In fact, India is that rare big emerging economy that has seen its  , while the world economy as such showed a healthy upward swing, 10 years since the 2008 Wall Street crash. This has been attributed to the twin economic shocks – demonetisation and GST – and PM Modi will have a hard time explaining the counter-trend in India as opposed to the global upswing. This means at the World Economic Forum, which is hosting 2,500 delegates including several heads of states or elected premiers, along with 120 global CEOs, Modi and Trump would be doing the opposite jobs. While Modi will be looking for more FDI – it’s significant that 100 per cent   via automatic route has been sanctioned just before the WEF 2018 – and “hard-selling India” as a brilliant investment destination, Trump will be selling his America First policies to retain most of the CEOs who happen to be Americans, to pick the United States over emerging economies with huge markets such as India and China. With business heads, prime ministers and presidents of countries, academicians, philanthropists, environmentalists, Silicon Valley honchos, human rights activists and members from art and cinema all descending on Davos for the WEF, it’ll be the usual potpourri of intense debates around the biggest hot-button issues of our times.  These  narrow nationalisms (including the Trump variety, but also perhaps the Modi variety), climate change, cyber-security and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation in manufacturing that is posing a serious threat to low-end jobs, refugee crises such as plight of the Rohingyas, and the ongoing battles creating fresh flux of conflict migrants, ecological damage owing to urbanisation, depletion of forest covers for agriculture and industry, river and ocean water pollution, etc. On the sociopolitical side, the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein revelations and the #MeToo movement and the new feminist wave gripping the world, the demand for new equality, the women’s marches in the United States but also in other countries, the rights of LGBTQ peoples and their battles with law and social prejudice, especially in a country like India, sex education and reproductive rights for women, etc, would figure prominently in the debates. Released a week before the WEF commences, the   underlines all the major threats and the likelihood of their occurrence or intensification, that the global systems need to face together. These include extreme weather events, natural disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud/theft, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, climate/war-induced involuntary migration, terror attacks, illicit trade, asset bubbles in major economies, weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear arms race, biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse, spread of contagious diseases, water crises, food shortage, among others. In fact, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum has clearly stated in the risk report that “unilateral nationalisms” pose a threat to the joint action needed to mitigate these enormous challenges, making a thinly veiled reference to Trump. While Europe is banking on French president Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bring more collaborative projects together, the presence of post-Brexit United Kingdom prime minister Theresa May, is likely to add to the clamour. Last year, in the aftermath of Trump’s election to the White House, WEF found an unlikely foothold in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ode to globalisation, underlining the great irony of a communist country head batting for the global capital and free market of funds and ideas. While Xi hogged the limelight and China filled in the huge vacuum left by the US in matters of international leadership, this time,   by Xi’s economic adviser Liu He, amid concerns over One Belt One Road initiative’s possible . This leaves a big opportunity for PM Modi to pitch India’s as the global destination for investments. As part of his Make in India scheme, PM Modi is likely to use the hoopla surrounding his Davos visit to signal that India is greenlighting major global companies to invest in India. His business dinner with corporate heads on January 22 and his   on   at the opening plenary session are both being looked forward to by Indian and foreign observers alike.    Though Union finance minister   the WEF, PM will be accompanied by a retinue of ministers, including Piyush Goyal, Suresh Prabhu, Dharmendra Pradhan, MJ Akbar and Jitendra Singh at Davos, and Modi’s motto is going to be  .  In two recent interviews, a rare occurrence in themselves, PM Modi maintained that his stint at Davos would be about “sharing his vision for India’s future engagement with the international community”. PM Modi is likely to meet Swiss premier Alain Berset to discuss issues of financial transparency and black money. Being the face of the world’s seventh largest economy with an excellent growth rate that was stymied somewhat by the twin shocks of 2016 and 2017, PM Modi’s handling of the 2.3 trillion dollar economy has been keenly watched in the almost four years into his government’s tenure. While the Indian delegation of business leaders and members of the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry), including Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji, Chanda Kochar, Uday Kotak, Ajay Singh, Rahul Bajaj, among others, will be signing or negotiating pacts with their foreign counterparts, superstar and king of Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan will receive the annual Crystal Award (along with Cate Blanchett and Elton John) for his work towards “improving the state of the world”. While Ramesh Abhishek, secretary, department of industrial policy and promotion, has confirmed that PM   with 60 top global CEOs, including 20 from India, on January 22 night, would be a big deal, literally, other informal interactions at the sidelines with representatives of General Motors, Sakesforce, Royal Dutch Shell, Nestle, JP Morgan, Airbus, Hitachi, BAE Systems, IBM, etc would be top calls on the part of the prime minister. The mix of soft power in the yoga classes, as well as the hard power through strong negotiations at the financial high table, would nevertheless be met with puzzling questions on India’s economic performance at home, as well as the case of Aadhaar which has now garnered  , despite fawning editorials earlier. This would naturally put a question mark of Modi’s other flagship scheme, Digital India, and would also sit well with the prognosis on data fraud and risk posed by digitisation encapsulated in the Global Risk Report 2018 by the WEF organisers themselves.","title":"World Economic Forum 2018: Anti-globalist Trump and FDI-hungry Modi stand for clashing trends in Davos","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/world-economic-forum-2018-davos-donald-trump-narendra-modi-climate-change-diplomacy-foreign-relations/story/1/21889.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15311},{"author":"DailyBite","content":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a hit in front of crowds — with millions of people watching him, waiting for him to speak, looking up to his podium with the adoration one reserves for deities. Yet, for all his charisma, it is hard to get a one-on-one with the PM. It is a rare occasion when one gets to see Narendra Modi answer questions posed by an individual in a closed room. So it was an “Eid ka Chaand” moment when Zee News’ Sudhir Chaudhary got the PM to give him an  . Even when faced with softball questions, PM Modi managed to give a few biting replies that will help bolster his supporters' affection and raise many an eyebrow — especially among his critics and detractors. Responding to a question on democracy and criticism, the PM  : “Criticism should not be seen as bad and this is the strength of democracy where everything must be analysed. Good things should be praised and shortcomings should be criticised.” About the criticism of the BJP government’s economic and financial decisions — including GST, demonetisation and the GDP growth rate slowdown — Modi said it is healthy since the country’s focus has shifted towards economy and growth. He added, however, that the BJP government has faced “less criticism and more allegations” and that issues like corruption and black money have long been a topic of discussion. He also  , “Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST. We brought economic reform, built toilets, brought electricity to 18,000 villages. The success of GST lies in the power of the federal structure. It takes time to adjust to change, but the outcome will be good.” But it was not just criticism the PM spoke about. On being asked about his unique diplomatic style — as he has demonstrated with world leaders like former US president Barack Obama, current US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin and Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Modi said he is an ordinary person and that is what helps other leaders befriend him. “Every time I stand besides world leaders like Putin or Trump, all I remember is that I am the representative of 125 crore Indians. They have given me the mandate to be there. We must also remember world is an interconnected entity and we cannot live in isolation.” Continuing on his interactions with world leaders and India’s position in the world, Modi said: “India has been instrumental in bringing world’s attention to financial transparency. It was acknowledged by former United States president Barack Obama.” Modi further stated that the Word Economic Forum (WEF) in  , Switzerland — to be held on January 22 and 23 — will be a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with the strength of demographic dividend: “Davos is a major platform in the financial world. Many business leaders gather there to deliberate upon the economic future of the world. India is the centre of attraction for the entire world. There are two reasons for that. First, our GDP is growing at a fast pace — and this has been accepted by leading agencies like the World Bank, Moody's etc; second, due to our strong democratic values. It's a unique combination of both in India. And that's what has evoked everyone's interest. So it's an opportunity for India to showcase itself on a global platform like WEF in Davos.\" Speaking of the Opposition, the PM said that the UPA government “did not address the issues of states. The central government did not listen to us. We respect the federal structure. Hence, we were forced to take economic and monetary reforms”. GST is the product of such a reform, he added. “We have worked hard towards building the concept of one nation-one tax.” Modi also spoke of a number of development issues, especially pertaining to the financial. “The country has witnessed a growth of 70 lakh accounts of employee’s provident fund. The Mudra Scheme launched by the Centre has also been successful. The initiative of government e-market has empowered small-scale entrepreneurs across the country. It has not only helped in reducing government’s expenditure but also dismantled the monopoly of big entrepreneurs.” Several times during the interview, referring to the gigantic mandate that got him elected, Modi said, “My work is to be the voice of 125 crore citizens and I am trying to do that honestly.”","title":"'Don't judge me on demonetisation and GST': Modi talks tough on criticism in interview","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/narendra-modi-interview-zee-news-gst-demonetisation-netanyahu-gdp-growth/story/1/21856.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15312},{"author":"Pooja Shali","content":"The news of the impending disqualification of   for allegedly holding office of profit spread like wildfire in newsrooms today (January 19) afternoon. According to AAP leaders, the matter to be referred to the president of India is without a complete hearing of the \"office of profit\" case. With that, the expected political blame game ensued throughout the day. Soon after coming to power in 2015, the AAP government had passed an amendment to the Delhi Members of Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1997 to \"exempt the post of parliamentary secretary from the definition of office of profit with retrospective effect\". The Kejriwal government later appointed 21 AAP legislators as parliamentary secretaries in order \"to assist ministers in speedy implementation of work\". The party even claimed that the 21 MLAs won't take any remuneration and so wouldn't fall under the office of profit regulations. It was the Congress, which on June 9, 2016 had moved the poll panel seeking disqualification of the 21 MLAs. Considering that one of them, Jarnail Singh, had resigned to contest the Punjab Assembly polls, the number stands at 20 now. The disqualification of the MLAs will pave way for by-elections in the Delhi Assembly. Sources claim 11 MLAs have been heard by the Election Commission and their statements recorded so far. The AAP, however, says these were not part of official hearing as the case was still in early stages of designating if EC, as a constitutional body, should hear the matter. Around 2pm today, reporters claimed their sources in the Election Commission (EC) hinted at a possible recommendation being sent to the president's office. It was also reported that the recommendation letter would agree that the MLAs received undue privileges as parliamentary secretaries, an additional position given to elected representatives (the appointments were against protocol). \r\n \r\n There, however, was no official announcement by the EC in this regard, neither a confirmation nor a denial. And this is what has precisely got the AAP's goat. The party leaders attacked the Election Commission for acting \"as an agent of the BJP\" and \"leaking information to the media\". \r\n \r\n The development signals considerable trouble for the AAP, which also heads the government in Delhi. AAP MLA Madan Lal rushed to the Delhi High Court in the hope of managing to get a stay order on the case. The court, instead, refused any interim relief and will hear the matter again on Monday at 4pm. The HC also reiterated to the party that the court has already deemed the positions unconstitutional last year and would not interfere further, asking the party to approach and respond to EC summons. \r\n \r\n \"If approved by the president, 20 of the 66 MLAs will be disqualified, with immediate effect. With 46 in tow (BJP-3,  SAD-1), they would still retain majority in the 70-member Assembly.   Interestingly, two MLAs within the AAP are anyway considered \"opposition\" - the vocal critic Kapil Mishra and Pankaj Pushkar, a supporter of Yogendra Yadav. So, the number would unofficially stand at 44 , for the AAP.  Delhi will have to then brace for by-polls to 20 empty seats. The situation, however, is purely hypothetical right now considering neither the EC nor the president's office has confirmed the \"movement of the file\". Sources maintain that the notice has been received and is under consideration. As reporters rushed to the AAP office by 3pm, party leader Saurabh Bhardwaj launched a scathing attack against the EC, making a personal remark about CEC AK Joti's age and his approaching retirement. “AK Joti was the principal secretary under [the then Gujarat chief minister] Narendra Modi and then the chief secretary of Gujarat. He is retiring on Monday. So you want to repay Modiji’s debt. You are mortgaging a constitutional post like the Election Commission,” Bhardwaj said. But the matter is at sub-judice, a fact that the AAP spokespersons were quick to remind. Party leaders, meanwhile, started to reach Arvind Kejriwal's Civil Lines residence and went into a huddle. Each AAP insider, I spoke to, expressed deep anger against the Union government, before the line either got cut or went on hold. The party leaders were oscillating between \"breaking news\" correspondents and chalking out a survival strategy. Since its inception, the AAP has accused most existing institutions of being corrupt and anti-people - media houses, political parties and bureaucracy had been declared as bought-off by the rich and the powerful. The party eventually realised that, once in power, the perpetual derogatory tone is not the best way forward. Interestingly, the Election Commission's credibility had also been questioned occasionally by the party, but today the AAP came out all guns blazing. But it's debatable if their arguments were justified since rather than focussing on facts, party members primarily targetted the chief Election Commisioner over his alleged proximity to the BJP. But it seems the AAP is not alone. Many others are also raising questions over the EC's move. \r\n \r\n Did the EC give any reasonable evidence in its defence against AAP's allegations that an independent organisation has compromised its credibility at the behest of a ruling party at the Centre? Well, an explanation by the EC will clear the air, before Arvind Kejriwal seizes the opportunity.","title":"AAP MLAs disqualification: How the 'office of profit' case unfolded","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aap-20-mlas-office-of-profit-election-commission-ak-joti-bjp-bypolls/story/1/21854.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15313},{"author":"Kiran Tare","content":"A fortnight after the riot at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on January 16 exhorted BJP workers to get into election mode in the next six months. That has led to speculation that the BJP might prepone Assembly election in Maharashtra by a year along with polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram. In his fourth year as the CM, Fadnavis' hopes to retain power are pinned on two \"achievements\" — his government’s social welfare schemes and the scattered opposition. While the first one has failed to convince the BJP cadre, the second situation might not last long, in the rapidly changing political scenario. Fadnavis has been insisting that BJP workers go out in public beating the drums on his government’s two goals, water conservation and debt-free farmers. The state’s flagship scheme, Jal Yukta Shivar, aimed at making 5,000 villages free of water scarcity every year, has delivered impressive results in some areas. The government has managed to deposit Rs 28,000 crore in the farmers’ bank accounts in an attempt to make them debt-free. However, neither the party workers nor its elected representatives are enthusiastic in advertising the government’s work. On the political front, the main opposition parties, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), are slowly but steadily working on their respective revival plans. The Congress has suddenly started feeling energetic after the Bombay High Court refused to prosecute its state president Ashok Chavan in the Adarsh society scam on technical grounds. Now, as he has no fear of action, Chavan is expected to come up with a broad strategy to corner the government. Confident that the government will not take any action against its two top leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the multi-crore irrigation scam, the NCP too has launched aggressive posturing against the government’s policies. A source told   that a fact-finding committee has not found any evidence of Tatkare’s involvement in the irrigation scam. On the contrary, the committee has pointed fingers at Pawar, whom the government does not want to touch due to several political compulsions. Caught in a tricky situation Fadnavis has only one option — boosting the morale of the BJP workers. He needs to pay attention to their grievances and demands and pat their back to make them feel they are also part of the government. His statement on poll preparedness is sparked by the sense of uneasiness he has noticed across the state.

Now, imagine what happens when the snow on these high mountains melts at a faster rate in view of the rising global temperature? From Jammu and Kashmir in the west, to Arunachal Pradesh in the east, India is blessed with an almost 2,500km-long Himalayan range with varying biodiversity in sync with altitudes. This includes Ladakh and parts of Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) that fall in the trans-Himalayan region. This is all part of the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region spanning eight countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (under Chinese occupation), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar — dependent on and facing similar problems due to the rising temperature in the HKH region. Ladakh has been witnessing increasing temperatures. Precipitation (snowfall in case of Ladakh) has been erratic to say the least. On the other hand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have been witnessing similar developments with springs going dry early each passing year. Mountain communities are dependent on the local springs for their daily water needs rather than the massive rivers gushing through deep gorges or meandering through valleys. What people on the ground and experts have been saying has been corroborated in a report that will soon be released. The changing climate is indeed a serious issue when it comes to the Himalayas, the repository of snow/glaciers that feed billions in the subcontinent. As part of the Paris Agreement, more than 190 countries have committed to reducing their green house emissions and taking various measures to ensure that the global temperature does not go beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (as compared to the pre-industrial time). But, even when the world manages to maintain the global temperature rise average at 1.5 degrees Celsius, there will be a rise of 2 degrees Celsius or more in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region by the end of the century, resulting in a substantial decrease in snowfall and melt rates increasing by at least 33 per cent. This is already happening as temperature increases more rapidly in the high-altitude region, points out a report being coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development ( ), an inter-governmental organisation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet (China), Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. The soon-to-be published report \"Comprehensive Assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) Region\", as part of the \"Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme ( )\" that is coordinated by the ICIMOD, points to a decrease in snow-covered areas and snow volumes over the coming decades in response to the increased temperatures and to the rise in the snowline elevation. The rising temperatures in the Ladakh region, made up of Leh and Kargil districts, should be a cause of immediate concern. Leh’s annual precipitation is about 100mm, all snow. Kargil receives more precipitation than Leh. For centuries, the region has received snow starting from October till March, vital for the survival of Ladakhi people and agriculture. Of this, snowfall in December, January and February is most important. But the scores of people whom I met last year and still others who I spoke with this year have been complaining about how snow has been missing for almost the whole of December in Leh town (about 11,000feet) and villages at a relatively lower altitude. A quick glimpse at the   (CRIS) of the Hydromet division of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Leh shows that between 2012 and 2016, snowfall in November for four out of five years showed 100 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. For December, three out of five years show above 90 per cent departure from long period averages for the district. I called Sonam Lotus, who heads the IMD’s Jammu and Kashmir office, to understand what this data means. “Although just five years’ data is not sufficient to predict a trend, it is nevertheless true that snowfall in Ladakh has been variable and inconsistent. But one thing our records show is that there has been a significant increase in temperature (in Ladakh) especially after the 1980s,” he told me. Earlier, when there was snowfall, the snow would remain for almost a week or more. But now it melts in just two days, he observed, arguing that the increasing number of people (including the large number of tourists) and vehicles have pumped enthno-carbon and other green house gases into the atmosphere as Ladakh witnesses a drastic change, positive by conventional standards, in the standard of living. While talking about the future of the mountain communities and how their lives and livelihoods are integral to the well-being of the mountains, a common factor that comes forth across regions is the participation of the communities themselves. Unfortunately, government programmes largely neglect local communities. Be it the dams in the fragile Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, be it factories set up along the rivers in the Himalayan foothills or the mounting problem of municipal solid waste, the government wants to keep away the community and bring in an outsourced partner. For decades now, the effects of such a debilitating approach are for all to see. It simply has not worked because community participation is the key to conservation, the key to ensure that local and global interests are taken care of. One of the best examples is the World Wide Fund: India’s Western Arunachal Landscape programme, which began in 2010, has been monitoring the presence of and working for the conservation of threatened species along with the local Monpa population of Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal Pradesh. The community was faced with the crisis of springs drying faster — a continuous topic of discussion among the community and the WWF people. “Our conservation programme are primarily community conserved programmes, managed and owned by the local community. It is for their interest, to secure their livelihood and their ecological needs. For many years now, the community has been talking about the need for spring rejuvenation. We now plan to study and identify the springs in these two districts as a pilot project,” said Kamal Medhi, WWF-India coordinator, Western Arunachal Landscape. It is the tenacity of the communities that will help in the long run, with or without government help. But having committed to the United Nations via the Paris Agreement, governments of the HKH region countries are duty-bound to help their mountain communities. Going beyond the geo-political boundaries, these communities have had a healthy cultural exchange and a thriving trade. Even today, positive case studies from one mountain community can be tried by others and the government can facilitate such experiments. After all, for the government of India, as for other countries, there are very limited options when it comes to water availability. Surely, the Himalayas and their glaciers, the snow and the rivers that sustain such an enormous population are vital for our survival.","title":"Rise in temperatures is threatening the survival of Himalayas","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/global-warming-climate-change-himalayas-ladakh-arunachal-extreme-weather/story/1/21812.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15315},{"author":"Angshukanta Chakraborty","content":"To immense applause from almost every quarter have the Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs)   between the newfound friends India and Israel, with great energy and enthusiasm from the respective prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu. The chemistry and bonhomie have already become legendary, and among the most talked about MoUs has been the “ ” deal, involving cooperation and sharing of data in the fields of cyber security, energy and agriculture. Involving a   cutting across sectors, such as cyberspace, energy, agricultural technology, Internet of Things and Internet of Energy, the big data deal has been pegged as “boosting measures... to revolutionise Indian farm production”. According to the Union ministry of external affairs website, the   signed between India’s Vijay Gokhale, MEA’s secretary of economic relations, and Israel’s Yuval Rotem, “envisages cooperation in the field of cyber security to develop, promote and expand cooperation in the field of HRD through various platforms and arrangements such as training programmes, skill development, and simulator based hands-on training. It also envisages collaborating in the field of cyber security resilience, promoting B2B cooperation in cyber security and facilitating industrial summits”. While the MoU between the respective ministries of petroleum and natural gas/energy cooperation states that it’s about “looking to explore opportunities of long-term cooperative relationship and joint economic projects to enhance bilateral engagements in the field of Oil and Gas, inter-alia including collaboration in upstream sector activities; R&D and Technology; promoting institutional linkages between Universities and R&D establishment for mutually beneficial collaboration; and in the area of Start-ups”. Another related MoU has been signed between Invest India and Invest in Isarel – respective platforms – with the purpose of “supporting and developing cooperation between the two sides through exchange of information on investment opportunities, relevant laws and regulations, policies and government initiatives”. Keeping these three MoUs in mind, it’s important to look at another related news which claims that Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is set to  , a “big data and smart city tech provider”, which is an important business delegate of visiting PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s official retinue. Reported by a number of websites, the then imminent deal was about RIL’s “move to get deep into the smart city, big data, defence and critical infrastructure space”. As reported by  , this deal is about RIL getting “access to next-level technology on a number of mission-critical monitoring systems, big data analytics software for power utilities, industrial internet of things (IoT), smart cities, critical infrastructure and defence sector”.   quotes an official part of the B2B event, saying: “mPrest places a specific focus on the IoE (Internet of Energy) sector. Its power utility offering is a ‘System of Systems’ platform with applications including DERMS (distributed energy resource management), asset health management, mobile asset management, SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) enhancement and critical infrastructure protection security, and cyber management”. It’s important to read these two news items together to arrive at, if not a set of conclusions, certainly a set of pressing questions. Given the critical big data deal between Israel and India comes at a time when extremely sensitive matters of the very constitutionality of such mass-scale data scooping, collation and storage without the citizens’ informed consent, and/or any informed opinion on the technologically nebulous issues, are being heard in the top court of India, how are we to read this inter-governmental agreement, if not as an instance of technology-driven impatience of both governments and corporate behemoths? \r\n \r\n As reported in  , apparently, the data-driven methods are being shared and accessed to “fight cybercrimes”, and the request for access to big data was from the Israeli side in the context of “how technology can now be used to agglomerate vast amounts of information and then bear on individual field and individual farmer’s efforts, improve the yield”. It’s interesting that in a country in which the majority of “individual farmers” are either landless or with very small landing holdings, with virtually no access to digital tech or data thereof, even as they are being forced to obtain the biometrics-based Aadhaar card and then link it to other nodes of information/identity proofs, the peg on which the “big data deal” has been hung is agricultural technology via data analytics. In fact, Union minister of agriculture Radhamohan Singh “participated” in the delegation-level talks on agriculture collaboration using India’s population big database. Moreover, to questions of “safeguards in place to share Aadhaar-based data with Israel”, there were no clear answers, other than stating basis aspects of an agriculture-centric programme. While the digital push to augment agriculture might be commendable in theory, there have been reported instances of   a very tangible, essential, non-digital ingredient necessary for agriculture – the waters of Narmada River. Even as the Sardar Sarovar Dam has been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with great fanfare, the   to “canals” and not farmlands, is becoming a huge bone of contention among the farmers of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Even Hardik Patel, the young Patidar leader who campaigned against BJP in Gujarat has tweeted his reaction to the agriculture-centric MoU between India and Israel based on the grievance on the ground. \r\n \r\n Given that the priorities of the government aren't exactly in perfect order when it comes to agriculture, with massive debt, rainfall lapses, crop failures and other endemic issues haunting tens of thousands of farmers, exactly how will a deal involving sharing of big data between governments and corporate behemoths - integrating the diverse investments in energy and telecom, while spreading its wings in emerging fields of data analytics and critical-monitoring systems - actually help the farmer in whose name the MoU has been signed? Which brings us to the next question: what about data security and privacy? What is the exact nature of the data that will be shared, and what all safeguards are being put into place? How is it that another country, Israel, is given access to India’s centralised databases, whose existence is under the scanner, and whose legality is being debated in the Supreme Court of India, as we speak? There have been a number of reports   by foreign agencies – whether foreign government-driven or private and commercial, but big enough to  , and the Aadhaar database –  as has been repeatedly proven –  is a  . In this context, it is important to ask if the inter-governmental MoU between India and Israel is at odds with the fundamental   of the individual farmer at whose behest the big data is being collected, shared with another country? All this at a time when a giant corporate entity from India, with extensive interests in oil and natural gas, telecom, etc is looking to not just   diverse fields, but also control the mechanisms of monitoring via   of Indians. As internet and privacy rights activists have asked, what does it mean to have “ ”? One of the fundamental premises is we must safeguard people, citizens, individuals, over innovations in technology that erode privacy, individuality, autonomy – informational and bodily. Aadhaar-based authentication and databases have proven to be structurally invasive and exclusionary, which means any technology based on, or dependent on, such a loophole-ridden system is problematic to the very core, at odds with India’s billion-plus citizens, who should not be treated as mere sources of data and be . In fact, Biju Janata Dal MP Tathagata Satpathy has argued on exactly this line, saying a line of argument that treats   should compensate citizens for sharing their data, not otherwise. Instead, if citizens are being harnessed and farmed for data, as it were, by governments, technology giants and corporate behemoths alike, then we have created a system that’s extremely problematic, to say the least.","title":"India-Israel ‘big data’ deal leaves questions about security and privacy unanswered","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/aadhaar-benjamin-netanyahu-modi-india-israel-big-data-deal-privacy-surveillance/story/1/21823.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15316},{"author":"Aroon Purie","content":"I am not a very religious person, though I was born a Hindu. I do celebrate the festivals and follow most of the rituals. My father was a follower of the Arya Samaj and we had \"havans\" on all auspicious occasions, a tradition I continue to this day. I was born in Pakistan and growing up in newly independent India, differences of religion, caste or ethnicity were not something I was aware of. We were taught to respect everyone, regardless of their roots. Some may call me deracinated, and I have to confess I still do not know my \"gotra\", but I believe the greatest quality of Hinduism is its liberalism and its plurality. It is those qualities that are under threat today, as who we pray to and how we pray becomes politicised. Where there is religion, can politics be far behind? This unholy alliance is ruining the world. Our democracy has been weakened by vote bank politics. The most obvious manifestation of this is the culture of appeasement of minorities practised by the Congress party in the 49 years it ruled the country since Independence. The aggressive assertion of Hinduism, otherwise termed as Hindutva, that we are witnessing today is a backlash to this. As the BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe writing in this issue says, “it has spurred a mindless competition to get the tag of minorities”. This is not the way forward if we are to build an equitable society. The disadvantaged should be helped regardless of caste, creed or religion. It will happen only if we stop mixing politics with religion and prevent extremists from radicalising faith. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s new book,  , puts upfront a critical issue of our time - the difference between Hinduism and Hindutva. While Hinduism has a distinct cultural ethos with a common history, common literature and common civilisation, Hindutva believes Indian nationalism is the same as Hindu nationalism, and that non-Hindus must acknowledge their Hindu parentage or convert to Hinduism to return to their true cultural roots. Hindutva maintains that Hindus need to preserve and protect their religion and culture against the onslaught of a hostile, alien world. It is insecurity that drives this sentiment rather than strength, which is what Swami Vivekananda, who can only be described as the first rock star of Hinduism, believed in. I believe Hinduism teaches us to live amidst a variety of other identities, and to do anything differently would be, as Tharoor notes, a partition of the soul, after the partition of the soil. In the best traditions of the religion, we have invited reputed scholars, ideologues and politicians to debate the issue. There is former BJP general secretary, KN Govindacharya, who believes Hindutva means Hinduness and not Hindu nationalism in the Western sense; former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi says the freedom of a Hindu to self-define his or her dharma is the greatest asset of Hinduism; novelist Kiran Nagarkar calls out the Sangh Parivar for obliterating the inherent inclusive values of Hinduism; while the bestselling author Devdutt Pattanaik exposes the myth of the wounded Hindu, tormented by a thousand years of slavery at the hands of the invaders. There is much more. Some of it is despondent, such as author and translator Arshia Sattar’s argument that the distinction between Hinduism as plural and Hindutva as singular is being lost at the hands of the newly empowered local gatekeepers of Hinduism and active proponents of a \"Hindu Rashtra\". For a multi-cultural country like India to be divided on the basis of religion is a recipe for disaster. But I remain hopeful. After all, which other religion in the world can say that it does not claim to be the only true one?

Pakistan Taliban’s claims are published in a  ,  , written by a senior Taliban leader Abu Mansoor Asim Mufti Noor Wali. The book was published on November 30, 2017, at Maseed Computer Centre at Barmal, in Afghanistan’s Paktika province. The 588-page book, posted online, contains TTP’s history, military operations, activities in Afghanistan, pictures of many Taliban leaders, and claims its involvement in a suicide bombing two months earlier at Bhutto’s procession in Karachi in October 2007, killing more than 140 people. The book claims that, “Despite attacks on Benazir Bhutto’s procession in Karachi, the government had not taken appropriate security measures that made it possible for the attackers to have easy access to Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi.” According to the book, Bhutto was killed since “her return was planned on the behest of the Americans as they had given her a plan against the ‘Mujahideen-e-Islam'. And slain Pakistan Taliban founder Baitullah Mehsud had received information of the plan”. For the first time, a terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the assassination which altered the political dynamics of Pakistan. Musharraf was accused of conspiring Bhutto’s assassination, murder trial remained controversial and Musharraf was declared fugitive. It is important to understand what compelled the TTP to make this announcement after 10 years. It would be useful to analyse some of the developments to be able to understand the unconventional move by the banned terrorist group. Pakistan's military launched a major offensive,  , in 2014 in North Waziristan and Khyber, following a major attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on June 8, 2014. The Operation was seen as a major success within Pakistan and the official records projected remarkable decrease in suicide attacks, terrorist attacks and fatalities in terrorist attacks. However, while the operation targeted a large number of TTP operatives, it did not manage to control the growth of extremism and terror within the country. There were major terror attacks in northwestern region conducted by Jaamat-ul-Ahrar (JA), a splinter group of TTP. The beginning of 2017 witnessed a series of terror attacks claimed by ISIS, challenging the success of the military’s counter-terror efforts. On February 22, 2017, Pakistan Army announced the launch of a nationwide military operation, Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad. According to an ISPR release, “the efforts entail conduct of broad spectrum security/counter terrorism operations by Rangers in Punjab, continuation of ongoing operations across the country and focus on more effectives border security management. Country wide de-weaponisation and explosive control are additional cardinals of the effort\".  The operation came as a response to a series of at least six back-to-back attacks in Pakistan within a week (mid-February 2017), killing more than 100 people in different parts of Pakistan. One of the deadliest attacks in the string of terror attacks took place on February 16, when a suicide bomber blew himself up among the devotees in the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. The attack was claimed by Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) and resulted in about 88 deaths and 300 injured. On the same day, in Awaran, an IED attack on a military convoy took place. is a continuation of the \"National Action Plan\" which was formulated after the 2014 attack in Peshawar on Army Public School. Expectations with Radd-ul-Fasaad have been high and army has claimed positive results from the ongoing operation, but the fact remains, that military’s \"selective approach\" in targeting terrorists will never allow the counter-terror efforts to succeed. Pakistan's military has been extremely proud of its counter-terror operations as these efforts have assisted the military to regain its waning credibility and prestige after  . Pakistan did draw out some applause from the US administration for its efforts in April 2017. The US-Pakistan relationship has been strained over the past six years and took an unyielding shift with the announcement of President Donald Trump’s Afghan policy which carried a firm message for Pakistan. Trump excoriated Pakistan for harboring criminals and terrorists. The US   revealed in December 2017 also carries an equally harsh message for Islamabad. Pakistan denied the charges and has reacted strongly to the US stance, claiming that Islamabad has lost 50,000 civilians and 6,000 security personnel in the war on terror and Washington cannot ignore these sacrifices. Although the US-Pakistan relationship is at the lowest in the past 16 years, the fact remains that both nations need each others’ support for various compelling reasons. While the US will require Pakistan’s support till it wants to continue its presence in Afghanistan, Pakistan is reliant on the US given its influence in international organisations. Washington is pressurising Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and Pakistan cannot afford not to take US concerns and stance into consideration. There have also been reports of ISIS establishing its base in Pakistan and spreading its tentacles. The  published by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, alleges that ISIS is especially active in northern Sindh and Balochistan. Given these developments - Pakistan's military rejoicing over its victory over terrorists (mainly TTP as it is the deadliest anti-state organisation), US pressure on Pakistan to intensify its counter-terror efforts and the threat posed by the expansion of ISIS - one can infer what led to Pakistani Taliban’s revelation of Bhutto’s assassination. The revelation at this point of time serves three main purposes for the TTP: • It is a repeat signal to Pakistan's military that TTP would counter every move of US-Pakistan partnership in counter-terror operations. • In the past one year, terror attacks by ISIS have been on the rise which poses a threat to TTP’s status. The announcement also helps the organisation to reassert its presence. • Lastly and very importantly, it brings Pakistani Taliban in news and national and international limelight in an effort to maintain its positon and status in the competitive world of terrorism. While Pakistan's military claims that terror attacks are reducing in numbers, the TTP appears to be intact and determined in its resolve to oppose the state.","title":"Why Pakistan Taliban is claiming it killed Benazir Bhutto","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/benazir-bhutto-assassination-pakistan-musharraf-tehreek-e-taliban-pakistan-baitullah-mehsud/story/1/21782.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15318},{"author":"Ashok K Singh","content":"VHP leader  ’s allegations about \"conspiracy to kill him to weaken the Hindutva forces\" sound as startling as the Congress’s overtures to him appear to be confounding. But pause for a moment to think and you will see that it’s neither startling nor confounding. The Togadia episode fits in well with the current politics of the BJP as well as the Congress. The international working president of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has been out in the cold for the past many years. He is of no use to BJP stalwarts Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in their home state. Togadia had no role to play in the Gujarat Assembly elections or its politics for a long time now. Modi has been winning the state elections on his own steam since 2001. In the early years, Togadia’s rabble-rousing, Muslim-baiting rhetoric helped mobilise VHP workers in Modi’s favour, but gradually Modi cut him to size.  Notwithstanding his nuisance value and hate speeches, Togadia, perhaps, was an asset for the BJP before and during the Vajpayee era. So were Ashok Singhal, assortment of sants and sadhus and many of Sangh Parivar motor mouths. But the Ayodhya issue gradually lost momentum after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Although it prepared the ground for the first BJP-led government at the Centre, the party realised it was running out of agendas to keep the Hindutva pot boiling. Until Modi strode across the Gujarat landscape as he became chief minister in 2001. Soon 2002 riots happened and Modi burst onto the national scene. After the riots, Modi had no need for Togadia and his ilk in Gujarat. He emerged at the head of the hardline Hindutva, as its most potent mascot. He was capable of packaging VHP, Bajrang Dal, LK Advani and Vajpayee in one heady mix that became brand Modi. He could do everything that Togadia was capable of, and much more, but in a subtler manner. By Modi's second term as chief minister, Togadia and VHP became virtually irrelevant in Gujarat. The VHP and Bajrang Dal lost traction. In 2007 Assembly elections, Modi forced Togadia to stay out of Gujarat. In 2012 elections, a desperate Togadia tried to stage a comeback. He threw his lot with rebel BJP leader and former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, but results reaffirmed Modi’s invincibility. The people of Gujarat had bought into Modi's cocktail of development and Hindutva.  Despite Modi facing rough weather in the recent Assembly elections, Togadia remained a persona non grata for the BJP.  His mysterious disappearance for a day, hospitalisation and press conference alleging that he feared for his life in \"fake police encounter\" at the behest of the forces that wanted to weaken the Hindutva cause can be understood in the background of his strained relations with Modi. But the Congress seems to be placing values on even a weakened and irrelevant Togadia. In its desperate bid to reclaim lost power, the Congress under the president Rahul Gandhi is prepared to adopt all means, including supping with disgruntled Hindutva forces. Senior Gujarat Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia met Togadia at the hospital in public glare. He said he met the VHP leader in his “personal capacity”, but expressed concern about \"dangers\" to Togadia’s life. Rahul Gandhi’s ally in Gujarat elections, Hardik Patel, too met him. \r\n \r\n While they hit out at Modi and the Gujarat dispensation and demanded inquiry into Togadia’s allegations, it was ironical that they didn’t speak about the former doctor who has been a symbol of hate and bigoted politics. The BJP has asked the Congress to clarify its stand on whether the party supports the VHP leader. Hardik Patel posted a flurry of tweets before and after meeting Togadia. \r\n \r\n The Congress’s hobnobbing with the VHP leader is part of Rahul Gandhi’s grand strategy to take the fight to the BJP camp. Emboldened by restricting the BJP to under-100 seats in Gujarat after his temple-hopping, declaring himself a Shiv-bhakht and janeudhari, Rahul Gandhi has made his intentions clear: a brick for a brick and an eye for an eye in the run up to the 2019 elections. Karnataka is bracing for a contest for Hindu votes between the Congress and the BJP. Later in the year, the contest is set to become even more ugly as the politics of grabbing majority votes gathers moment. One can understand Rahul Gandhi’s compulsion in wooing Hindus to regain votes the Congress has lost to the BJP. What’s difficult to stomach is that the Congress is willing to court someone like Togadia, perhaps the biggest hate monger the country has seen in the post-independence period. The central leadership of the Congress has not commented on Modhwadia’s meeting with Togadia, which speaks of its dilemma on taking a clear- cut stand. The Congress should have explained why Modhwadia met him and why didn’t he condemn Togadia’s politics while demanding investigations into the VHP leader’s allegations. The Congress’s occasional dalliance with the RSS has been known. Indira Gandhi’s temple visits and Rajiv Gandhi’s courting of soft-Hindutva for votes and its terrible consequences are also known. But never has the Congress dared to have truck with any bigot or Muslim baiter like Togadia or has even given the impression that it's ready to do politics with such elements. Or has the difference between “soft” and \"hardline\" Hindutva been completely blurred?  ","title":"Newfound love for Pravin Togadia unmasks Congress' Hindutva agenda","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pravin-togadia-congress-rahul-gandhi-hardik-patel-vhp-modi-amit-shah/story/1/21788.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15319},{"author":"Claude Arpi","content":"On New Year's Eve, President Xi Jinping   to extend his greetings to all Chinese and… friends all over the world. Xi said that Beijing is dedicated to safeguarding peace. \"China will act as a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and an upholder of the international order.\" Will this translate in peace on the border in 2018? Probably not! Rumours are circulating that troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have intruded in Gelling sector in the Siang Valley of Arunachal Pradesh. China has not fully digested the fact that India stood up for Bhutan when the PLA was trying to build a road in June near the trijunction between Sikkim and Chumbi Valley in Tibet. Quoting \"experts\", a PLA website admitted that China will be better prepared \"next time\": \"the recent Doklam standoff had propelled China to perfect its strategy in its western part\" said chinamil.com.cn. Zhao Xiaozhuo, a research fellow at the Academy of Military Sciences is quoted by the same newspaper: \"India never takes road construction as an opportunity… and only thinks about its own interest.\" Was the road on Bhutanese territory really an opportunity for India? It makes no sense. During a recent press conference, the spokesperson of the China's ministry of national defence said India \"should strictly control its troops\". While China is getting ready for another standoff, Beijing deeply dislikes Delhi developing its side of the border.  resented the recent visit of the Indian Union home minister  ; Singh spent the New Year with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). \"An Indian road construction project connecting all border posts along the China-India frontier could lead to new military standoffs between China and India,\" warned another Chinese expert. China is unhappy because Rajnath Singh asserted that \"a number of border posts had already been connected with roads and many would soon be linked… this would enhance the operational efficiency of the officers and reduce mountain-related sickness among them.\" While Beijing is going full steam to build infrastructure on its side of the McMahon Line, it complains about Delhi building roads on India's borders; amazing double standards. Nelong Border Outpost (BoP), located at the height of 11,700 feet, is manned by the ITBP. Accompanied by ITBP director general, RK Pachnanda, the minister later visited Pulam Sumda (14,200 feet) and interacted with jawans and officers. The area is disputed by the Chinese only because Beijing refuses to adhere to the universally-accepted principle of \"watershed\" used for demarcating borders. In Nelang, the watershed in the area is located at Tsangchok pass, beyond Pulam Sumda. At the same time, Beijing does whatever it wants on its side of the border.  recently reported: \"Investment in infrastructure in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is helping to lift 628 villages along the border out of poverty.\" The Chinese newspaper further asserted: \"After getting access to electricity and the construction of new roads, tea farmers and herdsmen in a village some 200 kilometres southwest of Lhasa in Tsona county founded a cooperative that provides skills training and job opportunities for villagers.\" Lepo, a tiny village, north of Khenzimane, the last border post on the McMahon Line is said to have received several thousands of visitors last year and adequate lodging facilities have been provided to them. China further admitted: \"Starting last year, more than 100 million yuan (Rs 99.4 crore) has been invested in infrastructure in villages of less than 100 families as a part of a broader construction project to build model villages in the border area.\"  estimated that by 2020, the road access rate in the area will reach 100 per cent and the per capita disposable income will double. Last week, Xinhua reported that China's least populated township had been connected to the national grid. It is Yume (also spelt Yulmed), the first hamlet north of Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh.Remember, at that time of the 19th Congress, Xi Jinping had written a letter to two young Tibetan herders who had introduced their village to the Chinese president. It was the same Yume.  commented: \"A sparsely populated township has been connected to the state electricity grid, ending life without electricity for its 32 residents.\" The contractor, a Xining-based electric power company who worked on the project is quoted saying: \"The 15-kilometer 10-kilovolt power line, which took five months to complete, is connected via 108 electric poles over a 5,000-meter-high mountain.\" There are many such examples along the Tibetan side of the McMahon Line. Year 2018 may not be serene despite the peaceful vows of President Xi.

He is the third chief minister in four and a half years. Bizenjo replaced Sanaullah Zehri of the PML (Nawaz), who was forced to resign from office ahead of a no-confidence motion against him. Not surprisingly, 11 of the 14 incoming cabinet members are members of the PML(N). Most observers see this manoeuvre as the Pakistan Army’s move to punish former PM Nawaz Sharif by depriving his party of any sustenance. If anything, this is a sign that parties and ideology don’t matter in official Baloch politics, but it is individuals who are easily open to manipulation. In fact, Bizenjo won the 2013 election with just 544 votes cast in his favour. The turnout in his constituency was just 1.18 per cent. In 2013, PML(N) won a majority of seats and formed a coalition government and selected a middle-class Baloch nationalist, Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party as chief minister. But Malik had to make way for Zehri in 2015. Baloch nationalists opposed the elections and many boycotted the process. Even those who did participate, such as Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the leader of the Balochistan National Party, rejected the outcome, charging authorities with manipulating the results. Balochistan has suffered from prolonged political turmoil and successive phases of insurgency and violent religious extremism. The most recent bout of violence began in 2003 and is still continuing. In the period between 2011 and 2016, nearly 4,000 people were killed, including 1,000 classed as terrorists, who could be separatists or sectarian killers who target Shias in the Quetta area. In 2017, violence intensified with massive bombings in Quetta, and other areas targeting Shias, Sufis and security forces. At the end of the year, a bomb blast killed nine and injured 57 people when a Methodist Church was targeted by the Islamic State. The Pakistan Army has sought to use violent religious extremist groups to counter Baloch nationalism and blame India for the violence. There are of course nationalist groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Army, Baloch Republican Army and Baloch Liberation Front. Pakistani authorities focus their ire on Brahamdagh Bugti of the BRA as the principal villain because he is openly pro-Indian and has even sought political asylum in India. But actually, most Baloch nationalists reject secession in favour of greater autonomy and the groups are hopelessly divided along tribal lines. Balochistan has now come into international focus because of a report that the Chinese may be establishing a naval base on the Jiwani peninsula, adjoining the port they built and operate in Gwadar. Not many are taken in by Beijing’s denial. As for Gwadar, it is the starting point of CPEC, which has become a flagship scheme of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan claims Chinese investments will generate jobs and prosperity for everyone, including the Baloch. The government believes that once the mega projects kick in, Baloch nationalism will lose steam. There is an element of wishful thinking in the Pakistani belief that CPEC will be an answer to all its problems and moderate Baloch nationalism. They believe the Baloch live in a feudal environment, dominated by their sardars and once the area is opened up, things will change. Pakistani authorities have shown little sophistication in addressing the challenge of violence in the province whose roots go back to the sensitive issue of Baloch identity. The Pakistani state, especially the Army, tends to see Baloch nationalism as a threat to Pakistan’s integrity. In recent years, Pakistan has sought to introduce the “Indian hand” as the cause of problems. They cited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s references in his Independence Day speech in 2016 and their capture of naval officer Kubhushan Jadhav to back their claims. However, Modi’s reference was innocuous to say the least and as for Jadhav, there is no real proof that he was involved in doing anything in Balochistan. Politics are not normal in Pakistan, and even less so Balochistan. Violence and political turbulence are, of course, there, but the real problem is that it is somehow not seen as being part of the Pakistani mainstream. By and large, its parties are electoral coalitions that rise and come apart depending on the exigencies of power. Sentiments are with Baloch nationalists, but authority is exercised by an elite which is backed by the Army.

It is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with experts calling it the most sophisticated ID programme in the world. Yet, recent events have proven that this mammoth exercise, which the present government has further pressed hard to make a standard requirement for availing the most commonplace of benefits and services, also faces the equally mammoth threat — data leakage. On January 3,   said its correspondent was given access to personal data, including names, addresses, postal codes, photos, phone numbers and emails of Aadhaar card holders for as little as  What’s more, with an additional Rs 300, illegal operators provided her a \"software\" that could facilitate printing of the Aadhaar card after entering the Aadhaar number of any individual. The initial response of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), which implements Aadhaar, was one of the proverbial \"shooting the messenger\", but following the cacophony the issue raised, it stepped into some positive action. UIDAI restricted access of around 5,000 designated officials to the Aadhaar portal. It also allowed citizens to use a virtual ID that could be shared with all agencies, including the government, rather than the 12-digit Aadhaar ID, lending it more privacy. The next question that is being asked is, has the decision to provide a virtual ID made the Aadhaar more complicated for the masses? How many of the citizens will actually use the virtual ID? Wouldn’t there be a large section which is still vulnerable? While the concept of providing every Indian a unique ID was hailed by all, it was the manner of it being made compulsory to avail services — right from the distribution of subsidies, to paying income tax to purchasing mobile SIM cards and insurance or even procuring a death certificate — that made it controversial. Giving out the ID for such services so rampantly also exposed it to misuse by fraudsters. The issue has reached the apex court, which is hearing a slew of petitions relating to privacy issues around Aadhaar, including whether privacy is a fundamental right. On October 30, the Supreme Court referred all Aadhaar related cases to a five-judge Constitution bench. The Court, on December 15, extended the deadline to link Aadhaar with insurance policies, mutual funds holding and mobile phones to March 31 this year. The next hearing is scheduled on January 17. This is not the first time that issues of Aadhaar data breach have been raised. In July last year, there have been reports that customer data of a telecom firm, comprising sensitive details of millions of its users, including their Aadhaar numbers, was leaked online. Even then, there was a demand from experts that India needs to strengthen its privacy laws in line with the 2012 recommendations of the Justice AP Shah-led group of experts on privacy. In its report, the panel had said that a framework on the right to privacy in India must include privacy-related concerns around data protection on the internet, appropriate protection from unauthorised interception, audio and video surveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy including DNA as well as physical privacy. In the absence of strict privacy laws, intimate details of citizens can easily fall into the hands of fraudsters, which need to be avoided at all costs. Even the staunchest of opponents to Aadhaar feel that the government is unlikely to back away from continuing to insist on Aadhaar ID for most benefits and services unless the top court comes out with some severe strictures. Certain countries, however, have backtracked on such initiatives after discovering flaws in it. Reports say the UK scrapped its biometric identification plan in 2010 and destroyed the associated database. Meanwhile, the Social Security Number in the US is not biometric and is not used for basic services such as phones and credit cards that can lead to mass surveillance and breach of privacy. Moreover, countries like Germany do not impose biometric identification to deliver public services. It can be argued that the situation in India is different, given the rampant leakages in the subsidy system, which calls for a more foolproof identification system.

Be it the launch of his political memoir (third book in the series) in October last year or his bold address at the Aligarh Muslim University on founder Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s 200th birthday, Mukherjee chooses his words and events carefully. The former president is all set to visit Bangladesh on January 14 on a three-day trip. Needless to emphasise, he enjoys enormous goodwill in the neighbouring country. Held in very high esteem from the days of Bangladesh’s struggle for liberation, his fan following , cutting across party lines, is simply huge. Incidentally, the native place of Mukherjee's parents-in-law is on the other side of the border, and he obviously has several close relatives living there. That apart, Pranab babu has earned this goodwill by sheer hard work and undivided attention to the well-being of Bangladesh in redressing issues pertaining to Indo-Bangladesh relations. His contribution can be called phenomenal in major contentious issues concerning India and Bangladesh. The veteran Congress leader held several ministerial portfolios in the government of India - external affairs, finance, defence etc. That notwithstanding, he never took his eyes off the happenings in Bangladesh and always used his good offices, in all seriousness, and on all occasions requiring effective intervention. Right from Bangladesh's independence war in 1971, Pranab babu has always been proactive and lending help whenever required - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return from imprisonment, his installation as the prime minister, the tragic assassination and the trail of sensational developments impinging on India’s geo-political landscape due to rise in power of pro-Pakistani, Right reactionary forces who usurped power by facilitating a military coup and exterminating Mujib.

The bloody coup was followed by counter-coups that took a huge toll and pushed Bangladesh into a turbulent time. Successive regimes, imposition of martial law, general Hussain Mohammad Ershad's rise and Ziaur Rahman's assassination were hallmarks of Bangladesh contemporary history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The man who held the hand of the distressed nation and at the same time took into account India’s security interests, is none other than Mukherjee. Although Sheikh Hasina (in her earlier stint) eventually came to power and was voted out after five years, Pranab Mukherjee maintained good relations with all and helped solve age-old problems of water-sharing and the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs ) accord that facilitated the return thousands of Chakma refugees to Bangladesh. In brief, whenever Bangladesh ran into rough weather, Mukherjee steadied the ship and things remained on course keeping Indo-Bangla relations intact. Interestingly, opposition leaders in Bangladesh too have immense respect for Mukherjee and acknowledge his vision and hold over the nuances of Bangladeshi politics. Mukherjee will be in Bangladesh to attend a number of programmes, including the closing session of the \"International Bengali Literature Conference\". According to   news report, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina \"will inaugurate the three-day literature conference on Saturday (January 13) at Bangla Academy, while Mukherjee will be present at the closing ceremony of the conference on Monday (January 15), as the chief guest\". He will also be flown in to Chittagong on January 15 to be honoured with a D Litt degree by the Chittagong University. In Chittagong , Mukherjee is also expected to be accorded a civic reception. On his part, Mukherjee will present a cheque on behalf of the Indian high commissioner to the Preetilata Trust in furtherance of its activities . Significantly , Mukherjee will also visit the memorial of Surya Sen aka Masterda, the famous revolutionary, known for the Chittagong armoury case. In Dhaka, he is scheduled to deliver the convocation address at the East West University and the Nikhil Bongo Sahitya Sammelan. So far, no meetings have been fixed with any political leaders. It’s assessed that abundant caution is being exercised so as to keep Mukherjee away from any political event, lest it is wrongly interpreted since the general elections in Bangladesh are due at the end of 2018 or early next year. On the whole, the visit is likely to go a long way in reinforcing ties between India and Bangladesh ensuring that at least there is one immediate neighbour who can be relied upon and vice-versa. His presence on the Bangladeshi soil will also encourage secular and pro-liberation forces to rally around Sheikh Hasina, which in effect, will help neutralise communal and divisive forces.  ","title":"Why Dhaka is gearing up to greet Pranab Mukherjee","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-bangladesh-visit-india-bangladesh-ties-sheikh-hasina/story/1/21725.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15323},{"author":"Nooreen Sarna","content":"When four of the   of the Supreme Court decide to hold a press conference to discuss internal disagreements, as they did on the morning of January 12, one   it was not an easy decision to make. One   that it was made under advisement and not carelessly or hurriedly. And one wonders how a schism of this magnitude can heal itself, without the independence of the institution being compromised, and in the absence of any rules or conventions to address factionalism in a collegium. The need for transparency in the functioning of the higher judiciary cannot be emphasised enough. The institution, while entirely unelected, wields a disproportionate amount of power. Constitutional amendments carrying the approval of Parliament and a majority of the state legislatures can turn to dust in the Supreme Court. Additionally, its members are (almost) uniquely difficult to remove from their posts; the process of impeachment being complicated, time-consuming and highly political. The   held at justice J Chelameswar’s house brought to the fore certain questions about the judiciary’s relationship with transparency in its functioning. First, why are there no internal safeguards to deal with administrative issues in the functioning of the Supreme Court? The fact that discussions among the five senior-most judges repeatedly failed, and that a press conference was held out of frustration rather than convention, highlights a lack of structure in the administrative functioning of the Supreme Court. It seems as though there are no intermediate steps to settle administrative or even disciplinary issues in our multi-tiered judiciary. In the higher judiciary, transfers on disciplinary grounds are not common and, naturally, at the Supreme Court, this is not an option. The remote threat of impeachment is the only way to correct or direct judicial conduct. However, impeaching proceedings cannot be instituted by other judges of the Supreme Court and can hardly be termed as remedial in nature.   For an institution considered to be self-governing and supreme, we find that, in situations of internal conflict, there is no structure for internal solutions, and recourse to the media and, possibly, political bodies becomes inevitable. Second, how do we trust that other decisions of this collegium have been made on objective grounds? The Supreme Court has 25 judges currently. Two appointments have already been made by this very collegium,  this past week, and more appointments may well follow here and for the High Courts. In the absence of a truly transparent appointment process, we cannot be certain that voting will not take place according to other prejudices and that the voting pattern won’t reflect other divisions. This is not to question the integrity of the four judges at the press conference (who constitute a majority of the collegium), but rather to say that dangerous conclusions are left to be drawn in the absence of public information available about the functioning of the collegium. And third, will we only see transparency in times of dissent? Is the judiciary picking and choosing when to be transparent? There must be transparency in administrative functioning of the Supreme Court, including in issues of allocation of matters to certain benches. This transparency should not be brought in only when there is a disagreement among the judges - it makes it akin to a kind of whistle-blowing, wholly dependent on the conscience and state of mind of the whistle-blower. This is not to say that there was no good reason to address the public about the deadlock in administrative functioning in the Supreme Court. For a body like the judiciary and the role it plays in our democracy, a show of transparency cannot and should not be sporadic. It should not open itself up to allegations of being motivated. Any efforts made at introducing transparency should be capable of serving as lasting precedents.","title":"Supreme Court judges' revolt: Hard-hitting questions for Indian judiciary","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent/story/1/21713.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15324},{"author":"Anusha Soni","content":"A lot needs to be said about the historic day when four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court on January 12  of democracy - the media - to convey that the third pillar - the judiciary - is currently facing immense threat. The only time India faced such a crisis was during the Emergency. As the legal reporter for India Today TV, I have been asked by many people about what led to the day's events. How did things come to a head? And where will this lead to in the coming times? I will try and answer them in this piece: It's true that in the past few months, the judicial corridors have been abuzz about how power is increasingly being concentrated with the CJI court and the manner in which the administrative powers are exercised by the CJI. About hundred cases are listed before the CJI on any given day. Many judges have spoken about this in hushed tones, on how it is improper for the CJI to overturn the orders of the other benches because there is no intra court appeal in the Supreme Court. As someone who spends every day at the Supreme Court to report stories, I will admit, I have felt inhibited bringing to light some of these issues which need to be discussed in the open. The order of two-judge bench cannot be overturned by a three-judge bench unless the two-judge bench has referred the matter to a larger bench. These are some of the grievances which have been criticised. The issue of impropriety, however, is more serious: It is repeatedly pointed in the seven-page letter circulated by the judges on Friday that the way the CJI exercises his \"administrative powers\" is arbitrary. This phrase needs to be broken down and looked at. Administrative powers in the Supreme Court means how cases are allocated to benches. It's extremely crucial that the matters are allocated according to the roster and not haphazardly. The allegation made implies that the CJI is not following the rules and is allocating matters to a particular bench to get a predictable outcome. A crucial unsaid truth about the judiciary is that journalists and lawyers can always get a sense of the mood and inclination of judges. Political leanings of judges, if any, are also widely spoken of, off the record. These things can't be said on public fora. A social closeness to a political person does not necessarily mean that the judge is not being objective while handling a case. But it is very important for the fate of the case as to in front of which bench it is listed. It is a crucial aspect in the process of deliverance of justice. It is not merely administrative in nature. What led to the happenings of January 12 go back to events of November 10, 2017 when the seeds of the dissent were sown. It was the day when the CJI  of Justice Chelameswar to refer the MCI scam to the bench of top five judges. An ugly scene broke out in the Supreme Court, with Prashant Bhushan openly alleging that the CJI was involved in corruption. An angry Bhushan walked out of the court when he wasn't allowed to speak. An order was passed by the CJI bench reasserting that the Chief Justice of India is the master of the roster. Even to this day, sources say, justice Lokur and other judges of the Supreme Court met justice Chelameswar. Some statement was expected on that day too, however, the steam seemed to have fizzled out. A few days later, the plea was referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. He was given this matter despite the fact that he was part of the five-judge bench which overturned the order of justice Chelameswar. Justice Misra was   about the conduct of Prashant Bhushan. Some argued that the matter should have been referred to another bench in the spirit of fairness. As expected, justice Arun Mishra dismissed the plea of Prashant Bhushan and severely criticised his conduct. In a related petition, Rs 25 lakh was also imposed on Bhushan. The matter was settled then, but a hurricane began to brew. Then came the plea seeking investigation into the allegedly mysterious death of judge BH Loya, who was presiding over the CBI court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. The matter was again referred to the bench of justice Arun Mishra. One of the petitioners in the Loya case came to me and informed that a senior lawyer backed out from the case by saying nothing was going to happen in the matter. It was during this conversation at 11.10am that a source informed me of the press conference. Interestingly, while the press conference was taking place, the CJI court around 12 noon was informed of the developments. A whistle was sounded in the CJI court and the guards rushed in to escort the CJI out of the courtroom. The timing of this entire incident cannot be overlooked. The press conference took place during the working hours of the Supreme Court and the CJI had no clue about this development. The top four judges of the Supreme Court rose up at around 11am and headed to the residence of Justice Chelameswar. Many legal experts today sound surprised with the developments of the day. They seem to have missed the frustration and the discontent brewing in the power corridors of the judiciary. The push and pull of the collegium is not something new. But when top four judges of the Supreme Court see no recourse but to address the media, we are indeed in for troubled times. The disenchantment with the way top court is functioning is deep and pervasive. The underlying current is the interference of the executive with the judiciary. When top judges of the Supreme Court say that democracy is under threat, we must take it seriously. When media shy judges are compelled to address a mob of press and speak openly, imagine the discontent and the helplessness festering within. The day shall go down in history when a clarion call was made for change and accountability. How it impacts the CJI and Parliament, the people of the country have a right to know and want an accountable judiciary.","title":"Why rebellion at Supreme Court was in the offing","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/supreme-court-judges-press-conference-cji-dipak-misra-transparency-dissent-justice-loya-mci-scam/story/1/21716.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15325},{"author":"Shantanu Mukharji","content":"With the advent of the new year, a group of office-bearers believed to be representing more than a dozen gurdwaras in the Canadian province of  , have jointly decided to ban officials representing India, its diplomats and others from entering the premises of the Sikh temples. The decision was taken at Gurdwara Jot Parkash Sahib in Brampton on December 30. Significantly, the pro forma statement mentioned “pursuant to the trespass to the Property Act (1990), the management of the Gurdwara Sahib reserves the right to ban entry to officials of the Indian government including but not limited to Indian elected officials , Indian consular officials and members of organisations who seek to undermine the Sikh nation and Sikh institution ( )\". The statement further stated: “Keeping in mind the interference of Indian consular and Indian government officials in the lives of Canadian Sikhs, gurdwara management committees have jointly taken the decision to bar the entry of these officials and members from gurdwaras across Canada. The presence of these officials makes members of the Sikh community uncomfortable due to their agenda of undermining the autonomy of Sikh institutions and organisations. It is our obligation to ensure the safety of the 'Sangat'.\" However, the statement clarified that the ban will be only on those visiting gurdwaras in their official capacity, not if they come in personal capacity. Meanwhile, pro-separatist activists, including Sukhminder Singh Hansra, have welcomed the decision alleging that officials were directly infiltrating into the Sikh affairs in Canada. This development is very  and, unless remedial measures are not taken without further delay, may give boost to the Khalistani movement, already brewing in the West. Examining the statements issued by the Sikh entities, it's difficult to miss the disturbing trend. When they say that the presence of Indian government officials tend to undermine the autonomy of the Sikhs and make them uncomfortable, it’s difficult to assess as to which factors are responsible to make the Indian officials’ presence uncomfortable. This appears to give a clear signal to the government to keep off the Sikh affairs which are interpreted to be the exclusive privilege of the Sikh clerical organisations. Gurdwaras have been rendering great service not only to the Sikhs, but to the world at large and the Indian community in particular in foreign countries. So what went wrong? Is it a growing distance between Indian diplomatic missions and Sikh shrines? This gap must be bridged sooner than later. It’s possible that a certain segment of the alienated Sikhs are discontented as their names continue to figure in the \"blacklist\" of the consular wing for their alleged acts in Punjab thought to be anti-national. If such suspicions are true, it’s time to revisit the names afresh. In today’s world of global uncertainties, no group can be insulated from the national mainstream. A healing touch is perhaps called for. Any tough measure is likely to be met with equally tough reaction which may be counterproductive. Coincidentally, barely 14 days after the Canadian notifications, the Sikh Coordination Committee East Coast (SCCEC) and America Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (APGC) stated that 96 gurdwaras have decided to ban entry of Indian officials. The ban would also hold good to Nagar Kirtans or religious processions. American Sikh entities following suit to the Canadian decisions, make the situation a little more complex. And if such bans catch on to other parts of the world, then a major fire fighting exercise seems called for before it gets out of hand. This also calls for caution as the SCCEC and the AGPC combine is the largest umbrella organisation of the Sikhs in the US. It is further known that the decision has been reached with the support of US-based Sikh group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). In order to enforce their diktat, the Sikh bodies have also threatened to initiate legal proceedings against those Indian diplomats trying to breach the ban. On its part, any state, or in this case the government of India, cannot remain oblivious to the designs of the separatists to go on a propaganda offensive espousing their so-called cause. It has to come down heavily on the elements, now on a collision course, supporting the Khalistan movement. Having said this, it’s equally important to assuage the genuine grievances, if any, of those Sikhs who are provoked to resort to such a drastic course of action. It seems all Sikhs in Canada and in the US do not support the latest move to ban the entry of the Indian officials. If not for the active cooperation from the gurdwaras, it wouldn’t have been possible for the government of India to contain the Khalistani movement, at its peak in the 1990s. Both the gurdwaras and the high commissions/embassies had excellent relationships, churning out best possible results for the Sikhs and the Indian government representatives. The late Naresh Chandra, former US ambassador, appropriated best of collaboration with the gurdwara forces bringing in much-needed peace. There are multiple names in this regard who accomplished the task with dexterity and patience. Both the Canadian and US statements have a thrust in banning the consular officers. Probably that’s where it hurts most because it extends services to passport and visa services. If they are attended to on a case-to-case and genuine basis, more than half the problem is solved. Consular staff, therefore, perhaps needs to be more caring, sensitive and patient to assuage the disgruntlement. Presently, the Indian ambassador to the US, Navtej Sarna, is a Sikh and a seasoned diplomat. His officers manning the different consulates also carry huge experience and acumen. Similarly, India's high commissioner to Canada, Vikas Swarup, is most articulate and experienced in public and media dealings. They can walk the extra mile to prevail upon the Sikh bodies to rescind their orders in the larger interest of the country’s peace and sovereignty. Equally important is to pre-empt any probable evil design by the Pakistani forces, especially the ISI, unleashed to encourage the Khalistani forces. Frustrated by its self-aborted designs of Khalistani propaganda for the last so many years, Pakistani agencies may be attempting to stir yet another move to pinprick our security interests. Such a move must be averted for good, as time is running out.","title":"Why gurdwaras in Canada and US banned the entry of Indian officials","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sikh-gurdwaras-canada-ontario-ban-indian-officials-khalistani-movement-pakistan/story/1/21705.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15326},{"author":"Mohammad Behzad Fatmi","content":"Under the ongoing state of emergency, Turkey has issued yet another controversial   on December 24, 2017, granting immunity to civilians who were part of the mobs which suppressed the 2016 failed coup attempt against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Authorities say such a measure was necessary to protect those civilians who risked their lives to shield their elected government - on the night of July 15 and the early hours of July 16, 2016 - from putschists. But the decree is so vaguely worded that it is possible for one to interpret it as granting immunity from prosecution for actions that one may have taken post-July 15 or may take in the future against a government critic on the pretext of suppressing the continuation of events on the night of the coup.  Regardless of its gravity and profound detrimental effect on the rule of law in the country, such a step by the AKP government hardly took anyone by surprise. Over the past couple of years, there have been multiple   of the AKP government establishing private militias loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. One of the such prominent groups is   which allegedly had dozens of its men armed with semi-automatic rifles on the streets of Ankara and Istanbul, assaulting and killing many of the renegade soldiers on the night of July 15, 2016. Interestingly, SADAT also stands accused of killing a number of innocent civilians on that fateful night in order to boost public anger and help the government create a victim narrative. The newly issued decree practically means that not only SADAT and a number of other shadowy outfits like it will not be punished for these crimes, but they will also not be brought to justice should they take law in their own hands in the future, in circumstances they argue were similar to that of July 15, 2016. This move has led many to believe that the government is preparing for an imminent clash between President Erdogan’s Islamist and Dogu Perincek’s ultranationalist camp who despite being contemptuous of each other formed an alliance in the aftermath of the coup attempt to purge state institutions of pro-western officials. Dogu Perincek was jailed in 2008 during the Ergenekon trials for plotting to overthrow the AKP government, but his conviction was   in 2014 when Erdogan started to target the Movement of Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. On stepping out of the prison complex he talked to the media waiting for him and   that he will dismantle the “regime of Tayyip Erdogans, Abdullah Guls, Fethullah Gulens”, referring to the perceived alliance between the AKP and the US-based cleric. Since then Perincek has been back in business growing the influence of his tiny far-left Patriotic Party on important state institutions, especially on the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK). The “Perincek group”, as the ultranationalist pro-Russian companions of Dogu Perincek are often referred to in the Turkish policy chattering circle, has been the biggest   of the massive purge of pro-Western officials from the TSK following the coup attempt in 2016. The meteoric growth in influence of an ultranationalist group which has always despised the Islamist-rooted AKP poses an existential threat to the Erdogan regime - and Erdogan knows it very well. On the other hand, many analysts see this move as Erdogan’s preparation for another “false flag operation” which will justify crackdown on the remaining few voices of dissent in the country - the way the July 15 events justified suppression of the Gulen Movement. Even though there is no effective opposition in the country, there are still pockets of resistance and/or potential rivals which Erdogan would like to neutralise. The likes of former president Abdullah Gul, a few defiant MPs from the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), and of course the Perincek group are certainly not the type of forces Erdogan wants to accommodate in his vision of a totalitarian regime in Turkey. Regardless of whether Erdogan had the former or the later motive in his mind while drafting this decree, the situation that it may lead to cannot be peace and order - which Turkey needs desperately. It will certainly push the country towards chaos and instability, perhaps even towards a civil war.  ","title":"Is Turkey heading towards a civil war?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/turkey-controversial-decree-coup-attempt-racep-tayyip-erdogan-civil-war/story/1/21677.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15327},{"author":"Majid Hyderi","content":"There is still hope, but only for some. In the past six months, two verdicts from the apex court on two separate pleas seeking fresh probe - into the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and the killings of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir in the 1990s and early 2000s - have drawn massive comparisons. On January 10, the   decided to set up a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to look into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases in 1984, investigations into which were closed earlier. The apex court has also asked the Centre to suggest names for the proposed three-member panel, which will be headed by a former high court judge. The 1984 riots, which broke out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had claimed the lives of an estimated 8,000 people in Delhi and around the country. But then, if riots dating back to 1980s can be reinvestigated through an SIT, why is it declared “too late” for fresh investigations into the killings of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s? In July 2017, the apex court rejected a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking fresh probe into the killing of Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir. Dismissing the PIL filed by an NGO “Roots in Kashmir”, the apex court said it would be difficult to probe as evidence “is unlikely to be available”. \"Almost 27 years have gone by… Where will the evidence will come from? Such a plea should have been moved long time ago,\" the   had observed. The petitioners had moved the court saying that they need a \"sense of justice\" in the case. \"The community has legitimate expectations. The successive governments have repeatedly made fake promises that the Pandits could return (to homeland). No one is protecting them,\" they prayed. The dismissal of the case buried all hopes for justice for the survivors of the systematic bloodbath. Apart from the outraged Pandit community, even a human rights group - largely run by Kashmiri Muslims - had sharply reacted to the court decision. The Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society in a statement had  : \"The Supreme Court order is a complete departure from established law that ‘crime never dies’, and there exists no time limitation for justice under Indian and international law with regard to serious crimes such as murder.\" The rights group observed that “killings of Kashmiri Pandits, other minorities and all violence in Jammu and Kashmir have never been fairly and credibly investigated”, adding, “Thus far, Jammu and Kashmir has faced widespread, systemic violence, largely at the hands of the Indian state.” Three decades on, the killings of Pandits, continue to be an unsolved mystery. For the all-resourceful government, it took around two decades to just consolidate contradictory figures of the killings. As per a first comprehensive report compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 2008, from 1989 onwards, 209 Kashmiri Pandits were killed. As many as 109 killed in 1990 alone. According to this   in , while 140 cases were registered at police stations across Kashmir, chargesheets had been filed in only 24 cases. In 115 cases, the perpetrators are yet to be identified. Even the first reported killing of a Kashmiri Pandit remains unsolved. According to the police, the first Pandit to be killed was a woman named Prabhavati from Budgam. She was killed in Srinagar on March 14, 1989, by unidentified gunmen, whose identity could never be established. Of all the districts of Kashmir province, the summer capital of Srinagar, as per the police records, had witnessed the largest number of killings  - 82 - within two years of the onset of the armed insurgency. Apart from individual target killings, in some instances, the minority community people were massacred. These include the Sangrampora massacre in which seven persons were killed during on the night of March 21-22 in 1997 in Budgam, 23 were killed in Wandhama on January 25, 1998 and 24  murdered in Nadimarg on March 24, 2003. According to the police, the perpetrators of the Wandhama massacre remain untraced. There are slight contradictions even in the official figures pertaining to the killings. In March 2010, the then government told the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly that 219 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed by militants since 1989, , and not 209,  as previously reported by the police. But a year later in 2011, the Kashmiri Pandit Sangarsh Samiti (KPSS), a Srinagar-based organisation, said at least 399 Pandits had been killed. There cannot be a bigger pain than the exodus of the bereaved community out of their homeland. And this wound has been festering in the absence of a fair probe, something which could clear the air and lead to the severest punishment for the perpetrators. It could equally contribute in reconciliatory efforts aimed at harmonious return of the Pandits to their homeland. If investigations into the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases were closed without investigation, probe into killings of Pandits never took off. For the Sikh community, it has been an unfortunate case of justice delayed (even as the latest Supreme Court decision revived fresh hopes), but for the Pandits,  it remains yet another grievous instance of justice denied.","title":"If 1984 anti-Sikh pogroms can be reopened, why not Kashmiri Pandit killings?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sit-probe-kashmiri-pandits-exodus-supreme-court-justice-delayed-denied/story/1/21666.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15328},{"author":"Hriday Ranjan","content":"Every time an actor announces the decision to join politics, my curiosity is piqued. We are a nation that worships stars. But when it comes to elections, we show them the ballot finger. Since the ‘50s, film stars in India have, without hesitation, hopped on to the next, logical platform: politics. According to a   entry, India has three times the number of actor-politicians than most countries, followed only by USA and Philippines (I wonder what’s happening there!). Election results for actors have been far from blockbusting. Indian film stars have realised the bitter truth that winning votes is a lot tougher than bashing up villains. In fact, Sunil Dutt might be the only major film star who had a long, successful political career — winning five terms and also serving as Union minister for youth affairs and sports in the UPA government. Govinda did nothing of remote importance as a politician; the highlight of his political career being the moment when he begged Sonia Gandhi to become the prime minister — much like the climax of a certain David Dhawan-Kader Khan film. Hema Malini’s political career has been as spectacular as her daughter Esha Deol’s film career — with reports of villagers protesting outside her office since they saw zero development under the Dream Girl’s leadership. Hemaji is now seen as a representative for Kent RO. Actress Jayaprada’s career started with the Telugu Desam Party in undivided Andhra Pradesh; she then switched to Samajwadi Party in UP, and finally launched her own party. Chiranjeevi, the Telugu megastar, too, started his own party in 2008. In 2011, in a move that would give Chanakya a stroke, he merged it with the Congress. And then there’s the murky history  Amitabh Bachchan and late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors scam. It is not only film actors who have dipped their fingers in the hot oil of politics. TV actors, too, have tried their luck. Smriti Irani is a success story, but other TV actors have found less success. Actors who essayed the roles of Ram, Krishna, Draupadi and Ravan (!) in mythological shows have contested elections in India. Shekhar Suman joined the Congress, lost an election, and returned to TV. Rakhi Sawant launched her own party targeted at the ordinary citizen, called Rashtriya Aam Party. So absurd is the association of stars with politics that Salman Khan has campaigned for both BJP and Congress. Bhai has gone so far as to campaign for the Sri Lankan president. Why?  Many actors such as Amitabh Bachhan and Govinda have gracefully resigned from politics, whereas the other have faced defeat, or been invited as Members of Parliament in Rajya Sabha. Barring Kerala, every Indian state has had actors chancing their luck in politics. Overall, the success rate of film stars in politics has been — to put it accurately — like Fardeen Khan’s career. However, this is only true in the northern parts of India. Down South, film stars have had blockbuster careers as politicians. People from north India are often baffled at the sycophancy surrounding film stars in Tamil Nadu, and attribute it to emotional overtures. It could be driven by emotion – like the temples built for actresses Khushboo and Namitha suggest. But politics is deeply intertwined with cinema in Tamil Nadu. The three largest political icons in Tamil Nadu are film stars — MG Ramachandran (actor), Karunanidhi (screenwriter) and Jayalalitha (actor). In undivided Andhra Pradesh, then megastar NT Rama Rao founded the Telugu Desam Party and became the chief minister of the state. In December 2017, Rajinikanth announced that he will contest the next Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. In many ways, Tamil Nadu politics is starkly different from politics in any other part of the country. Thalaiva’s decision to bring about “spiritual politics” might have raised eyebrows in any other part of the country, but in Tamil Nadu, nobody batted an eyelid. The contribution of film stars to Tamil consciousness is rooted in the philosophies of Periyar and the self-respect movement. The state has a high Human Development Index (HDI) score when it comes to parametres like primary education and healthcare. In a nation that is slanting dangerously close to religion year after year, Tamil Nadu’s Dravidian politics has washed its hands of religion and caste. In fact, Tamil Nadu’s leaders are proud and fierce atheists — from Karunanidhi to Kamal Haasan. Thalaiva has his work cut out. Like in the film   Thalaiva is entering an arena with two established players — the AIADMK and the DMK;  Yet, Rajinikanth is not your average film star getting into politics. He is said to have 55,000 fan clubs in the state, besides a diasporic network of fans.

One came out last week when   newspaper reported that personal details of citizens could be bought for as little as Rs 500 via WhatsApp. Rachna Khaira, the journalist who broke the story, explained how unknown agents were able to provide access to names, addresses, photos and email aliases from what is advertised as Aadhaar's impregnable database. Her report compounded concerns over the security of the citizens' privileged details at a time when risks of identity fraud have mounted the world over. For cyber criminals, personal information is a gateway to potential scams. Khaira's report was expected to stimulate the UIDAI to generate an environment of confidence and safety when   has been declared a fundamental right. It didn't, unfortunately. Instead, the UIDAI went on a power trip. It filed a police complaint against the reporter and her newspaper among others. Its action rhymed with what is now a pervasive trend to spin unpalatable news reports, no matter how vital they might be to public interest. Investigative journalism is a great public service. As an editor of India Today TV's Special Investigation Team, I can say with conviction that investigative reports stand tall when political stories dominate regular television rundowns and fake news floats freely on social media. This form of journalism is centred on firm impact and not around TV ratings or digital hits. It sets a stellar example of agenda-setting reporting. India Today's enterprising SIT cadre has itself revealed massive scandals, underground economy, organised gangs, education scams, child labour, medical frauds, terror financing and a lot more over the past one year. These journalists have mostly gone undercover to their subjects — and caught them confessing to wrongdoings on hidden cameras. Had it not been for the SIT's exposé of a widespread   in Bihar, India simply wouldn't know about the scale of malpractices inside the state's educational institutions. Its startling reporting on the business of toxic hospital waste brought to light some of the worst forms of environmental and child labour. Our SIT busted black-money mafias across a variety of sectors in the wake of demonetisation. And when this Special Investigation Team broke a mega-exclusive on the Pakistani funding of the Hurriyat in Jammu and Kashmir last year, multiple government agencies swung into action in multiple states. The story set national news agenda for weeks that followed. What drives these courageous investigations is a mission to serve the people's right to information. But now imagine a situation when an investigative reporter is intimidated by the threat of trial for impersonation and cheating. It would suffocate the entire genre of investigative journalism. Remember, undercover reporting is a technique investigative journalists adopt widely across the world in order to get access that would otherwise be declined. They would pose as businesspersons, sport agents, financiers, patients, middlemen and so forth with a sole goal to get the information out for the larger public interest. But what has happened over the first weekend of 2018 is a vicious kick in the teeth of investigative journalism itself. In the world's largest democracy, journalist Rachna Khaira is charged under the IPC's sections related to impersonation, cheating and forgery for exposing glaring holes in the UIDAI's privacy-protection armour. Instead of putting its house in order, the UIDAI has tried to shoot the messenger down. But it's not all doom and gloom. For now, India's media fraternity has stood united against this spiteful tactic to suppress stories that hold power to account. But let's not stop here. Let this campaign be sustained in order to preserve, nourish and protect investigative journalism — that insatiable quest for the realities of power in the face of powerful opposition.","title":"Why UIDAI's FIR against The Tribune journalist is a kick in the teeth of investigative journalism","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/uidai-fir-aadhaar-data-breach-mass-surveillance-investigative-journalism/story/1/21632.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15330},{"author":"Javed Anwer","content":"Aadhaar didn't start as surveillance technology. While the concept of a unique ID for all was fuzzy even in the beginning — around 2009 — it was meant to be an authentication technology that would plug leaks in India's welfare schemes. The idea behind Aadhaar seemed well-meaning, but the way it was designed and hurriedly pushed made it evident to keen observers that it was not going to end up well. There were many problems with it, but of particular note was the way Aadhaar would give the government and bureaucrats unnecessary power over individual citizens. Instead of being a tool of inclusion, Aadhaar would be a tool of exclusion. Even in the early stages, it was difficult to imagine that one day the Aadhaar would turn into Frankenstein's monster. In 2018, it has become a tool that has the potential to put every citizen in this country under surveillance. The argument that Aadhaar is a tool to end corruption in India surfaced earlier this decade. After 2012, and exceedingly after 2014, Aadhaar grew in ways it was not meant to when it was conceived. This has happened as the UIDAI — the agency in charge of the Aadhaar programme — acquired unaccountable power over the people of India, and made its operations as secretive and opaque as it can. Fun fact 1: Do you know that under Aadhaar Act 2016, the UIDAI has virtually no accountability, but has provisions that stop Aadhaar users, that is ordinary Indians, from filing any complaint against it in court for the misuse of the UID? Fun fact 2: Do you know Aadhaar was never meant to be an ID card? In the initial days, Aadhaar was linked to government's welfare schemes. For instance, it was made mandatory for issuing ration to all those who held a ration card. This despite the fact that the Supreme Court, in its interim order, told the government that having the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory in any way. Post-2015, all hell broke loose. By now, Aadhaar is no longer just technology to authenticate the identity of those entitled to benefits under government welfare schemes. It transformed into an authentication technology for almost everything Indians do. In 2018, if you go by the directives issued by the government, you have to link your Aadhaar to almost everything you own or do. Aadhaar is no longer required only for welfare schemes, like obtaining a ration card, but also if you want to continue using your phone. It is “required”, although not yet mandatory, for availing banking services until March 31 because Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to it. Aadhaar is required for registering births in many parts of India, and even deaths. Aadhaar is required if you want an LPG connection, even if you don't intend to take subsidies. And Aadhaar is required if you want to send your children to school or if you want your degree, and for treatment at many hospitals — even if you are an accident victim and are brought to the emergency with severe head trauma! This is just the beginning. If the Supreme Court dismisses the current challenge to link Aadhaar with every aspect of our lives, be ready to see more Aadhaar in your life. Even simple tasks like buying airline tickets or making hotel reservations or renting homes will soon necessitate Aadhaar authentication. It is important to understand why Aadhaar has become so pervasive. By linking the UID with children’s admissions in private schools, or by linking it with private data, such as your phone number, the government is not saving any money. It is not curbing or cracking down on corruption. It is just putting in place an infrastructure: arguably the world's biggest surveillance apparatus that a country has built to keep an eye on its citizens. Sure, the United States’ NSA will still be bigger, but then NSA for now watches only non-Americans. In the recent years, Aadhaar has metamorphosed into the perfect surveillance tool. It allows the government to collect and record every piece of data that Indians generate as they go about their lives. By storing this data in one place, with Aadhaar as its key, the government will be able to theoretically track and build profiles of every Indian with the UID. There is the argument that we already leave a digital trail whenever we use a phone, carry out a banking transaction, book an air or train ticket or get an LPG connection, and so it doesn't matter that Aadhaar is linked with the service. That is true. But by linking every detail of our existence with Aadhaar, the government puts all of this data in one place and makes it incredibly easy to monitor, record and use. Across the world, governments seek to gain more control over citizens. When they have achieved some level of control, they also abuse it, as history tells us. Even if the original intent is benign, never in the history has a government built surveillance apparatus and not abused it. If we allow Aadhaar to grow unchecked, controlled and managed by an agency with no accountability — and it is the UIDAI that filed an FIR to go after people who pointed out Aadhaar flaws — the results are not going to be pretty.

The Gayoom government would be sending its foreign minister Mohamed Asim and defence minister Adam Shareef to India later this month. The proposed dates of Asim and Shareef's visit are January 11 and January 16, respectively. The two visits would be important events for the India-Maldives bilateral relations and a major diplomatic bid by the Gayoom government to build bridges with India after a series of unsavoury episodes. Currently, the India-Maldives relations are frigid on account of a host of incidents in the recent past such as Maldives signing its first-ever Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China despite its avowed \"India-first\" policy, the Maldivian media owing allegiance to President Gayoom severely criticising India in general and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, and restricting Indian envoy Akhilesh Mishra's movements in Maldives. President Gayoom is dispatching his foreign and defence ministers to India in a last-ditch effort to mollify India, greatly hurt by a series of provocations from Maldives, some of which have been mentioned above. Though these ministers would obviously be meeting their Indian counterparts, Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman, their main agenda would be to meet the big man himself, PM Modi. The course the relationship between the two countries takes would all depend on whether Modi is willing to meet the two senior Maldivian ministers. If he does so, it would be construed as a big concession from India and denote that the Modi government is willing to forgive and forget. But as of now the indications are that Modi won't give them an appointment, citing his busy schedule considering that the budget session of Parliament is scheduled to begin from January 29, with the tabling of the Economic Survey. The MEA has confirmed that the Maldivian foreign minister will be calling on PM Modi on January 11 evening. Significantly, Maldives happens to be the only neighbouring country which Modi hasn't visited. He was scheduled to visit the country in March 2015 but cancelled the trip at the last minute after the Gayoom government arrested former president Mohammed Nasheed, a friend of India, under trumped up charges of terrorism and sedition. Since then, India-Maldives relations have been strained. What has greatly upset the Modi government is that the Maldivian media known to be have allegiance with President Gayoom, has criticised PM Modi for his pro-Hindu politics and called him names. Maldives, a tiny nation with a population of just about 4 lakh people (in contrast Delhi's Karol Bagh has a population of over 5 lakh), is a hundred per cent Muslim nation. The   is watching the developments closely and doesn't want Modi to meet the Maldivian ministers. India would be giving a mouthful to the visiting Maldivian ministers over the issues mentioned above and would like to know what concrete actions the Gayoom government has taken or proposes to take in the near future to take care of Indian interests and sensitivities. For example, India would like to see reversal of some India-centric policies that the Gayoom government has implemented over past few weeks. India would like to have a firm commitment from Maldives that it wouldn't unleash its media to poke India in the eye. Some of the statements from Gayoom himself have muddied the waters. Gayoom has of late made several remarks at his public functions wherein he has castigated India without naming the country. The Indian position is that that such remarks, coming from the head of the government, have been too harsh and detrimental to the larger cause of good relations between the two SAARC member states. India would also like to have a commitment from the Gayoom government to have an inclusive domestic policy wherein the Opposition is taken on board, not victimised and repressed as is the trend. India would like to have an assurance that Maldives won't do anything to gag democracy and accord due space to the Opposition given the Maldivian presidential election are due in about eight months. The biggest talking point of India will be to convey a message that Maldives shouldn't play the China card in its dealings with India, something which another SAARC nation Nepal has been doing for decades. While India cannot tell Maldives not to have close relations with any foreign power, including China, New Delhi would be making it clear that Maldives would be playing the China versus India strategic game at its own peril. India is quite upset over the fact that while its envoy in Maldives Akhilesh Mishra is having his movements severely restricted, the Chinese ambassador is being given a special treatment. India is concerned over the manner in which Maldives has on the one hand been wooing China but on the other hand tightening screws on India. Under the Gayoom regime, the Chinese strategic footprints in Maldives have been growing larger and larger while India has continuously been cold-shouldered. The social media trends mirror this situation very well. For example, while workers in Maldives from other countries have been living in shanties, the Chinese have been building plush permanent structures for their workers. But India has its own leverages with regards to Maldives, especially considering the fact that it's much closer to Maldives geographically than powers like China. Also, Gayoom is not unmindful of the Indian leverages. That's why he is sending his ministers on a diplomatic mission. Watch this space.","title":"Why India needs to talk tough with ministers from Maldives","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/india-maldives-relations-mohammed-nasheed-yameen-abdul-gayoom-sushma-swaraj/story/1/21633.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15332},{"author":"Mrinal Pradhan","content":"The   has been passed by the Lok Sabha. That is a victory for women, democracy, as well as secularism, but not many people see it that way yet. Let us consider the plight of the average woman in the world today, with US President Donald Trump also being charged with sexual assault in a lot of anecdotal references. Let us also consider the plight of the average Muslim in India, and now consider the plight of women in this light. There is no case one can argue in favour of the men, the husbands of the country, with regard to an issue of their wives’ rights, especially in the case of a right that is well known to be necessary for any human being, not just a Muslim woman. In the 1980s, when Rajiv Gandhi interfered in the famous  case, there were protests that the interference was setting up a dangerous precedent. Thirty years later, the politics of polarisation has resulted in a short, but dangerous history of demolitions, riots, burning of trains, and attacks on non-vegetarians. Now that the government in power, which may well have benefited from the said bloody history, is trying to undo the damage, people (mostly men) are protesting against the new law. They cite that it would be contrary to the prescriptive morals of their way of life. And from their point of view, they may even be right. But the fact remains that a large number of women suffer and have suffered due to the obvious disproportionate distribution of rights between men and women when it comes to the subject of breaking marriages. Some would even say that divorce should be outlawed in Hindu societies, which is also symptomatic of the lack of rights women share globally. The other extreme would say that divorce is fine, but that only men have exclusive rights with regard to divorce. How on earth can one justify the ending of a marriage so arbitrarily when even relationships are seemingly impossible to let go of in an arbitrary fashion? The question of the legitimacy of the bill to criminalise triple talaq is not even relevant here. An appeal to one’s most basic shred of a conscience is enough to justify the legitimacy of women’s rights. Have we all disrespected women so strongly for so long that one has to   that women and men should have equal rights to say the least? Whether this new policy and corresponding law of the Hindu-majority government will be beneficial in the practical sphere or not is subject to the tides of time, but the sheer legitimacy of this law is unquestionable in most commonly held views on ethics. The rest is our choice, sociological or ideological. Secularism implies non-interference in social matters pertaining to religion. However, women’s rights along with many other rights ordinarily considered fundamental to democratic societies are more important for the larger sake of secularism itself. How can it be that through non-interference in social laws the government can protect social rights? Interference of any sort in the metaphysical sphere of things in understandable, but Lord Benedict’s arguments for criminalising Sati a few centuries in the past under the influence of Raja Rammohan Roy, one of India’s premier intellectuals, is as valid today as it was then. If one sees exploitation occurring around them, the first reaction should be to interfere, as positively as possible, to curb that exploitation. The BJP government may hold allegations of inhumanity against them, but a step towards egalitarianism is far more human than burning women alive for dowry, arbitrarily breaking marriages which are alleged to be made in heaven, or forcing girls into child labour. The very fact that the Opposition is not opposing this bill severely is enough proof that even our liberally hated politicians of Delhi are synergistically showing signs of reform. When the Congress majority government of the 1950s decided to implement a uniform codification of all personal law with respect to Hindu law, the then right wing had decided to oppose such change. Now, it is believed that the right-wing government in power may be stepping further towards a uniform civil code for all. Uniformity of social policing notwithstanding, the fate of women is an issue in its own right, globally, and should not be denigrated to a low-key fight for communal compartmentalising. Demonetisation may have allegedly been a failure. However, politically it benefitted Modi, on account of the divide that it created between the rich and poor of our nation. Triple Talaq may be a failure in reality, but it has added to the divide between Muslim women and men. If men do not wish for militaristic feminism in the manner of communist militarism between haves and have-nots, they should tread this line further, namely that of the middle path, protecting women rights without allowing rogue elements to twist the debate in their patriarchal favour. Sooner or later, the consciousness of matriarchy shall step in and destroy the absurd injustices of a thousand years. But until then, the men, leaders, minority spokespersons and such should be forewarned. Women are human, as human as our grandfathers who drove out the British, and eventually, an evil establishment fails through its own contradictions.","title":"Triple talaq bill: Is it a social reform or a political weapon?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/triple-talaq-bill-muslim-women-gender-equality-bjp/story/1/21584.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15333},{"author":"Rajeev Dhavan","content":"The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights of Marriage) Bill 2017 or the triple talaq bill is a vindictive outcome of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shayara Bano case of last year. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons (SOR), the bill traces its moral authority to fulfil the Supreme Court’s decision that instant divorce (talaq-e-biddat) after three pronouncements was illegal. The SOR says, “The judgment vindicated the position taken by the government that talaq-e-biddat is against Constitutional morality, the dignity of women and principles of gender equity guaranteed under the Constitution.” This, according to the SOR, was in contradistinction to the view of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which wanted to issue advisories. The very wording of the SOR displays a sense of triumph against the Muslim community, a sort of posturing by the government over the Muslim community through the bill. The government’s reading of the Supreme Court judgment is hopelessly misleading. The minority view (of ex CJI JS Khehar and Abdul Nazeer) was that instant talaq is a recognised Islamic practice and it was for the Parliament to intervene if it wanted to. The need for government legislation follows from here. The split majority struck down instant talaq for different reasons. One view was that it was contrary to Islamic law (Kurien), the other that it violated constitutional equality (Nariman–Lalit). The government’s flowery reference to constitutional morality and gender \"equity\" is based on this latter minority view because the second majority judgment simply declared it contrary to Islamic law. The bill emanates from the imagination of the government to (a) showcase Muslim law as unjust and (b) instrument a careless and vindictive law to break up Muslim marriages. Once the court declared instant talaq to be illegal and unconstitutional, the simple declaration in Clause 3 outlawing any form of instant triple talaq was enough: “Any pronouncement of talaq by a person upon his wife, by words either spoken or written or in electronic form or in any other manner whatsoever is illegal.” At first blush, Clause 3 gives the broad impression that “talaq” itself is illegal. Of course, “talaq” in the definition clause limits the bill to talaq-ebiddat or all forms of instant talaq. A clever presentation — too clever. But after the SC declaration that instant talaq is illegal, this meant the marriage subsists with all the obligations of Islamic law. Here the bill takes an “ugly turn”. It assumes that although instant talaq is illegal, but with its pronouncement, the marriage itself has broken down requiring remedial action. It gives the right to subsistence allowance and custody of children to the wife similar to divorce proceedings when marriages break up. The bill assumes that the illegal declaration of talaq by the husband virtually breaks up the marriage requiring questions of subsistence allowance to be adjudicated by a Magistrate. In other words, the declaration of instant talaq accelerates a marriage breakdown when the real purpose of the Supreme Court and, supposedly the bill was that the marriage remains alive and well. But the bill regards the very utterance of instant divorce as a kind of breakdown or judicial separation requiring magisterial intervention on maintenance and custody. This is the evil effect of the bill to break the marriage rather than cement it. Why “subsistence allowance”? If instant talaq is illegal, the wife is lawfully wedded with full privileges of a wife. “Subsistence allowance” is a step down — legislative cruelty denying the wife and children total rights. How absurd can this be? A fully wedded wife not legally divorced by her husband will be entitled to only adjudicated subsistence for herself and her children. This part of the bill is antigender, anti-SC judgment, anti-common sense and directed to break up marital relations. The fully wedded wife would run off to a Magistrate for what happens in judicial separation or divorce for relief. Husband and wife are put in legal attrition Finally, the criminality provisions are provocative and irresponsible. Clause 7 means that if the husband utters the instant talaq words, he would commit “an offence which is cognisable and non-bailable”. This means he can be arrested by police and remain in investigative custody unless the Magistrate intervenes. Is this designed to cure the marriage or perpetuate discord? Everything illegal is not a crime. Making it criminal, distorts the relationship between parties. The BJP uses its majority in Lok Sabha to do what it likes. On December 20, 2017, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad answered that after the SC judgment, 99 cases of instant talaq were reported. Is that enough to punish the Muslim community, causing legal quarrels between husband and wife and sending the husband to jail for up to three years. The debate was sparse. The Opposition quiet. So what if they were in a minority, the Opposition should have torn apart the whole bill (not just the penal provisions). In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition put up a fight. But gradually it also caved in — agreeable to compromise on the pen provision not being cognisable and non-bailable. The bill was not passed in the Winter session. But it should be circulated for public opinion or, at least, sent to a select Parliamentary committee as demanded by some members. This is an unfair bill produced by BJP majoritarianism.

He belongs not just to the world of movies, but is part of folklore. He is a metaphor for the miracle we call films. His very entry brought a democratic ease to film. I remember Rajinikanth was a bus conductor. He was once asked by a journalist, “If you had not been a bus conductor-turned-film star, what would you have been?” Quick came the answer, “Oh, a smuggler or a bootlegger.” Rajini was emphasising the fundamental equality of all occupations in the informal economy, from where Kollywood scripts often originate. That was decades ago. When Rajinikanth announced he is going to join politics, start a new political party, the enthusiasm did not work out like the release of his films. The DMK and the AIADMK felt he was not real enough for politics. Many academic activists were even dismissive, arguing that Rajini had taken no real stands in politics. But the problem is a more complex one. Rajini is older. Maybe legends do not age, but Tamil Nadu as a society has. The golden age of politics and its creativity, reciprocity to film is over. Annadurai and MGR are gone, the DMK under Stalin appears a bit like a political still life. The DMK-AIADMK battles that dominated the last few decades create little excitement. In fact, the most exciting person in Chennai is Jayalalithaa. Even as a dead person, she could sweep the election. She has the charisma even as memory to make crowds hysterical and hysteria can flow like a religious current in this city. But what is more obvious than Jayalalithaa’s absence as presence is the emptiness of Tamil politics. Despite being a corrupt prima dona, Jaya had the makings of a Tamil deity. There is a touch of the lukewarm to Rajini’s entry. Probably English language newspapers are more deadpan about it. They make his entry sound like a benign Rotary club meeting. But once one hears Rajini in Tamil, he seems a different person, more in command, almost prophetic about the new digital constituencies he is planning to create. Rajini still offers the politics of hope Tamil Nadu so desperately needs. One break on this move reaching a cinematic climax is the political future of another great star, Kamal Haasan. Haasan too wants to enter politics and make a difference. His seems more the voice of the left, but one is not clear whether Haasan is speaking of his sympathisers on the left or of a need for a fully articulated leftist ideology. While both still stand like Achilles before their tents, Amit Shah and BJP seem busy. They realise the potential of the moment as all the big parties seems dormant. They realise that the creation of a Trojan horse would have a deadly effect, but one wonders whether Tamil Nadu would forgive any one for playing a Trojan horse in a cinematic sense. Tamil Nadu as a society has always been proud of its autonomy from Delhi. Even Modi at the height of his power cut little ice with Jayalalithaa. Yet it is the emptying of politics that haunts one. Tamil Nadu lacks a Periyaar, a Kamraj, a Rajaji and an Annadurai. Each could have mobilised the imagination. Today’s party leaders stand like Uriah Heaps, their very secondariness is so obvious.  The very emptiness of political space is begging Rajini to enter. He realises that he has to offer something new and that the newness of his politics has to at least match the enthusiasm Delhi felt for Kejriwal before he became a more domestic figure. Rajini claims he wants to create a political revolution, the beginning of a spiritual politics. I guess it is his way of saying he wants to initiate an honest politics without invoking a critique of Jaya or DMK. He talks of a politics devoid of caste and religion. I guess what he is looking for is sociology of a new constituency different from the current vote banks that have tied up politics into predictable rhetorical grids. What he is hoping to trigger is a generational change in livelihood and lifestyle, which could redefine society. The script as it stands today sounds empty, or at best, well-intentioned. Rajini does not project the ease of politics. He stands like a star waiting for a cue from the director, desperate for the right plot and the right lines. But the moment, in terms of its timing, has tremendous potential. A new generation wants to rewrite society and Rajini has the stature to lead them. Maybe it is time civil society came to his aide, preparing an ideological programme, and create a new reciprocity between civil society and politics. One is thinking in particular of an attempt to revive the fate of agriculture, marked by epidemics of suicide. What is true of farming is also is also becoming true of fishing. The recent impact of Cyclone Ockhi revealed that the Tamil Nadu politician had no sense of the travails of deep sea fishing. If livelihood politics, human rights and ecology were to combine once more embedded in a theory of culture and the creativity of language, Tamil Nadu can offer a new politics to a Modi embroiled India. I do not think this is the time for cynics or for so-called realists to say that Tamil Nadu politics will continue to see-saw between factions of the Dravidian movement. Rajini has the charisma, and civil society, composed of ecologists, feminists, educationalists, can provide the content for a progressive dream. Like a good actor, Rajini knows how to pick his cues and like a charismatic politician, he can give such ideas a drama, a force which can create a new dream of politics. Society cannot play spectator for long. It has to script the new dream of politics, brushing aside the tiredness and staleness of the old profession politician. It is time for the miracle to happen.

As Maharashtra descended into chaos following the violence orchestrated by rightwing leaders Sambaji Bhide Guruji and Milind Ekbote during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the  , the BJP found itself torn between condemning the rabble-rousers and asserting a pro-Dalit stance to shed the party's label of being an upper-caste party. What seemed easier, obviously, was to keep quiet. In Maharashtra's history of Dalit versus others, two incidents in the past saw a major shift in political dynamics. Back in early 1980s, the Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence when egged on by his \"troubled conscience\" former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar University. After a 16-year-old campaign - Namantar Andolan - Dalits half-succeeded in renaming Aurangabad's Marathawada University to Dr BR Ambedkar Marathwada University. Pawar though was made to pay for his \"altruism\" later as he lost the support of the Maratha community even as Shiv Sena, which strictly opposed the renaming move, further strengthened its base. Pawar, who used to enjoy considerable popularity in the area, could never \"recuperate\" and lost his base among the Marathas. Several attempts to undo the hurt failed as the Namantar Andolan had left the fissures wide open. In another incident which went on to change the political equations in the state, Mumbai police, back in 1997, opened fire upon residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar who were protesting against the desecration of Ambedkar's statue. The police firing claimed as many as 10 lives. The incident led to significant unrest throughout Maharashtra, including rioting and social boycotts against the protesting Dalits.  Although the then Shiv Sena government justified the police action, many couldn't overlook the fact that those in power find it justifiable to use excessive force to muzzle Dalit assertion. This particular incident brought together Dalit groups, including the one led by Prakash Ambedkar and Ramdas Atahawale. The impact of the Ghatkopar incident could be seen in 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Despite riding high on the Ram Mandir issue, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine was brought to its knees by the grand coalition of all republican factions with the Congress and its allies winning 37 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats. Pramod Mahajan too lost his Mumbai North East seat (Ghatkopar East and West Assembly segments fall under Mumbai-North East) due to wide spread anger against the police brutality in Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar. The following year in 1999, the Shiv Sena-BJP lost the Assembly elections in Maharshtra. Following the latest spate of violence in Maharashtra, many believe the Bhima-Koregaon episode could prove to be chief minister Davendra Fadnavis' Ramabai Nagar moment.  Even though Fadnavis has been patting the back of his government \"for not letting the violence go out of hand\", the Sena, this time, tore into the BJP government over the violence saying \"the only work left [for the BJP] is to fight elections using the government machinery and the police\". While the BJP doesn't have any prominent Dalit face in Maharashtra, the Bhima Koregaon violence, in all likelihood, will only increase the party's dependence on Union minister Ramdas Athavale, who for years was a staunch opponent of the RSS. The BJP for long has tried to shed its upper-caste label. In 1990s, Parmod Mahajan tried to break the BJP's image of a \"shetji bhatji’ (Baniya-Brahman) party with the help of Gopinath Munde by wooing the OBCs. While Munde became the BJP's OBC face, Dalits still remained far away. Dalits, who form around 11 per cent of the population in Maharshtra, have been a solid social block behind the Congress and Pawar's NCP. After winning the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP tried its best to bring the Dalits into its fold. It was precisely why Athawale - one of the prominent Dalit faces of Maharashtra - was brought to Rajya Sabha and then made a Union minister. Despite that, Dalit support to the BJP remains elusive. With the latest spate of violence, the BJP will find it harder to decide whether to woo the Dalits or to rile the Marathas, who form about 30 per cent of the state's population. ","title":"How Bhima Koregaon violence poses a major risk to BJP's Dalit politics","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-upper-caste-bjp-fadnavis-brahmins-dalits-atrocities-violence-hindutva/story/1/21563.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15336},{"author":"Chandra Kumar Bose","content":"\"Rose early but found Prabha still suffering. A son was born at midday..,\" reads a brief entry in Janakinath Bose's diary dated January 23, 1897. The newborn, the ninth child of Janakinath and Prabhabati Devi, was named Subhas. Janakinath was then practising law in Cuttack, in the state of Orissa. He headed a large extended family.   later recalled in his autobiography,  , he felt \"like a thoroughly insignificant being. My parents awed me to a degree\", in the family. It is now 121 years since the birth of Subhas Chandra Bose, and 73 years since his last known journey out of South East Asia, reportedly to the Soviet Union, in mid-August 1945. On January 23 every year Subhas' birth anniversary is celebrated across India. Speeches extolling Bose's charisma and personality, his unique contributions towards Indian independence continue to be made, and stirring national songs continue to be sung in his honour. On that day, in addition to institutionally sponsored events, spontaneous remembrance ceremonies organised by neighbourhood and citizens' groups also take place. This is a unique feature associated only with   birth anniversary which reflects the depth of people's veneration for him after more than half-a-century of his disappearance. This, in a sense, is a fitting tribute to a man who dedicated his life to liberating India from British colonial rule, and had a vision to make \"Free India\" one of the leading nations in the world. But January 23 will pass and Bose will again be relegated to the pages of history. Though deified by many, his ideology and mission are forgotten. Worse, they are not even known by the younger generations of Indians. From his entry into the Indian political movement in the early 1920s, through his prison years and bouts of serious illnesses, Subhas had developed his thoughts on social, political and economic issues which then formed the basis of his ideology. His famous address as the president of the 51st session of the Indian National Congress at Haripura in 1938 contains the crux of his political and economic thinking and plans. Is it widely known that it was in Haripura that Subhas launched the very first Planning Commission for India? In all his key addresses in India and abroad, in articles published in various journals, Subhas articulated his vision for a free India. In his view, the most important problems to be addressed in independent India were that of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy, challenges which have not been met even after 70 years of independence. Together with the celebratory functions, a more fitting tribute to Subhas' memory will be to effectively propagate his vision and ideology, which will in turn promote a better understanding of the history and politics of India, and also inspire the present generation of Indians to shape the country on the basis of the high moral values and principles that Subhas stood for and practised all his life. Subhas' works should be part of school and university curricula. Research institutes, including Netaji Subhas Foundation, Kolkata and London, should actively encourage and support national and international scholars to reassess Subhas' role in the Indian independence movement, and also his contemporary relevance. A deeper study of his works will show that many of his social and economic plans still remain valid. In the current Indian situation where there is a bankruptcy of leadership, ideas, commitment and action, Subhas' message, through his writings, speeches and commentaries may help to resurrect the failing morale of those who are working to bring positive change in this country. Above all,   life-long emphasis on the importance of communal harmony and unity among people, irrespective of birth, caste, creed and religion, has not only remained relevant, it has also gained a sense of urgency. In a world torn by ethnic, tribal, religious and regional conflicts, Bose's unqualified rejection of bigotry of any kind from the very outset of his entry into the Indian political scene, and his repeated call for unity among all Indians, famously reflected in the motto of the Indian National Army - Unity, Faith and Sacrifice, alone can help create a secure foundation of contemporary India. Conscious of the grave danger that communalism posed to a country such as India, where people of many faiths were inextricably mixed together over centuries, Subhas had repeatedly warned against the virus of religious bigotry entering the fabric of politics. In referring to what should be the attitude towards religion and caste, Subhas had declared \"... the government of free India must have an absolutely neutral and impartial attitude toward all religions and leave it to the choice of every individual to profess or follow a particular religious faith\" (The Fundamental Problems of India, address at Tokyo University, November 1944). Subhas' legacy will be better served if he is brought alive through his works. However, there is another reality. During the time of the British Raj, Subhas was treated as enemy No 1 and his book  , banned across the coutry. This is understandable and could have been expected from a colonial power determined to hold on to India and ready to suppress any threat to its rule. It is therefore particularly ironic that after the government of free India took charge, a systematic attempt was made to reduce Subhas merely to a Bengal hero, who though deemed idealistic, was seen as a misled individual, and had made the terrible mistake of discarding Mahatma Gandhi's non violent ways in India's freedom struggle. It is only because Subhas had entered the minds and hearts of the Indian people, and of the peoples of Asia, that all attempts at diminishing his stature and role in Indian and global politics have not fully succeeded. The role of the first government of independent India under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in this process of suppression and distortion cannot be ignored or denied. Historians have noted that Nehru had always perceived Subhas as his main rival, and his own statements bear evidence to that fact. Subhas himself had once written that \"nobody has done more harm to me personally and to our cause in this crisis than Pandit Nehru\" (letter to his nephew Amiya Nath Bose, April 17, 1939). As more evidence begins to emerge, it will be possible to make an objective and proper assessment of the role and personalities of our leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and others. When in August 1945 Subhas disappeared, his beloved elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose was in prison. Sarat and Subhas had shared an extraordinary relationship as brothers. Their close personal and emotional bond was enriched and deepened by their shared social and political ideology and goals. After Sarat was released in September 1945, he immediately resumed his campaign for a free and united India. He also decided to acquire the family's ancestral house on Elgin Road in Calcutta to establish an institution for the study and propagation of Subhas' ideology. In 1946, Sarat inaugurated \"Netaji Bhawan\" at their ancestral house and laid the foundations for a Netaji museum and research centre in the name of his brother, who was by then popularly known as Netaji (our leader). It was Sarat's wish that the Bose house should also be used for public and charitable purposes. The Azad Hind Ambulance Service, which he started, provided much-needed medical and social services in the city, especially during the dark days of communal strife. These were tumultuous times for Bengal and India as a whole. A new alternative was beginning to emerge in Bengal's political firmament. Hope turned to Sarat Bose to carry the torch ahead. He became the undisputed leader of the Congress in West Bengal. He was then elected leader of the Congress in the Central Legislative Assembly and became the leader of the Opposition. Sarat's membership of the interim government was, however, short-lived. He left the interim cabinet and the Congress refusing to agree to the partition of India on communal lines. Within a few years, a greater tragedy was to strike. On February 20, 1950, the very morning Sarat was to make an urgent appeal to the people of the two Bengals to reunite, he suddenly passed away. In an attempt to keep alive Bose's legacy and to give it concrete shape, the close followers of the Bose brothers, supported by Sarat's family, set up Sarat Bose Academy at Netaji Bhawan in 1952. It gathered within its fold eminent historians, lawyers, journalists and other committed voluntary workers. It also attracted interested persons from overseas. The academy launched an ambitious programme to develop Netaji Bhawan as a centre of excellence for research and exchange on both national and international affairs. It also aimed to function as a centre for the promotion of arts, music and languages, while continuing to provide other public services. It was to be the main archive for the works of Sarat and Subhas and for all types of documents and records related to them. The major objective of collecting key documents as well as photos and films on the life and activities of Subhas Chandra Bose began in earnest. Amiya Nath Bose, general secretary of Sarat Bose Academy, who took up his father Sarat's mantle, engaged himself fully in this task. He collected a substantial amount of materials, including primary documents, newspaper clippings, journals, films and other stuff on Netaji's activities both from India and abroad. All of these materials were deposited at the Netaji Museum and archives to be made available \"... to students and scholars for the study of and research about the life and work of Netaji...\" The Sarat Bose Academy began publication of Subhas and Sarat's works, and set up a comprehensive photographic exhibition portraying the life and work of the Bose brothers. By the late 1950s, significant progress had been made in the collection of materials for the Netaji Museum and its archives, and it was concluded that it would be appropriate to create a separate body \"to undertake a systematic study of Netaji's life and mission\". This ultimately led to the creation of the Netaji Research Bureau in 1957 under the chairmanship of well-known journalist Satya Ranjan Bakshi and Sisir Kumar Bose (a son of Sarat Bose) as general secretary. Thus, Netaji Bhawan, with its three main organs - Sarat Bose Academy, Netaji Research Bureau and Azad Hind Ambulance Service - was designed to act as the lead institution to uphold and promote the Bose brothers' legacy, and to work towards realising their cherished goals. However, here again the forces bent upon destroying the legacy went to work. Gradually, the Netaji Research Bureau came under the direct influence of the Nehru dynasty dominated central government. The Sarat Bose Academy moved out of Netaji Bhawan. Netaji Research Bureau became the only organ to remain under the directorship of Sisir Bose. Since its inception until now, over a period of 61 years, the Netaji Research Bureau has accomplished one of its basic goals and has published in 12 volumes, almost all of the writings, speeches and letters of Subhas, the bulk of which was originally collected under the auspices of Sarat Bose Academy. The Netaji Research Bureau has reportedly obtained substantial funding from the central government. But judged against its own objectives, and what was envisaged by its founders, the work of Netaji Research Bureau may be said to have been limited. Netaji's own works are not widely available, and conditions to access the archives at Netaji Bhawan are obscure. Was there a price to pay for support from those who have an interest in keeping the Bose brother's legacy in check? In view of the current realities of India today, those who believe in Subhas' ideology and its relevance in contemporary India, must take the initiative to revive, disseminate and act on the basis of that ideology. Such initiatives are already being taken by certain civil society and media groups both in India and abroad. A website is being launched by The Bose Legacy - www.theboselegacy.com - which will be an online archive for all of Subhas' works, a data base of bibliographies and scholars. It will also contain photographs and audio-visual material. The overall objective is to provide access to relevant materials to all those who wish to study the life, activities and ideology of Subhas, and also to those who wish to define their actions in terms of Bose's vision of India and the world.

From small mandals (groups) to chowks, almost everything is named after Hindutva icons. No wonder the controversial Sambhaji Bhide chose this place as his Karma bhoomi. On reaching Sangli on December 4, we saw a huge procession in support of Bhide, who is fondly called as Bhide Guruji by his followers. The 85-year-old founder of Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is accused of orchestrating the violence at the   of the battle fought 200 years ago in Bhima Koregaon. As we headed towards his house in Gaonbhag area, we were told that Guruji does not carry a cellphone (or \"bhraman dhwani\" as he calls it). So once he picks up his bicycle and leaves, no one knows his whereabouts. The Datta Niwas building is situated in a narrow bylane of the old town. A police van was parked outside the lane, even though Bhide has not been provided any security cover. As we neared his house, it seemed almost everyone knew the way to his first-floor abode. However, much to our disappointment, we found ourselves staring at a lock on the door. We left a small note at the doorstep. Not too many people know about the staunch Hindutva ideologue, especially outside Maharashtra, but for those who have closely followed the state's identity politics, Bhide Guruji is a familiar name. An ardent follower of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, many say, Bhide's real name is Manohar but he calls himself Sambhaji after the Maratha king. Maratha organisations like Sambhaji Brigade or Maratha Mahasangh allege that Bhide, who is an upper caste Brahmin, deliberately professes Maratha history in a Brahminical perspective. Guruji has a sizeable following in western Maharashtra, particularly in Sangli district, and parts of neighbouring Karnataka. The man with a magnum moustache is usually dressed in a white kurta pajama or dhoti, but never wears a footwear - no matter where he goes. His followers say that Bhide is an MSc in nuclear physics from Pune University and has also served as a professor in Pune's Fergusson College long ago. In Sangli, Bhide is often seen riding a bicycle. He delivers sermons on Shivaji and Sambhaji, most of which are focused on the warrior kings as Hindutva icons. In 2009, he found himself embroiled in a controversy when communal violence broke out in the twin cities of Miraj-Sangli in Sangli district during Ganpati visarjan over an arch, sporting a poster that depicted the slaying of Afzhal Khan - the most capable commander of Ali Adil Shah II of the Bijapur Sultanate - at the hands of Chhatrapati Shivaji. It was reportedly erected just a day before Ganesh visarjan. Even though many demanded his arrest, Bhide came out \"victorious\" without a single scratch. The man is known for his fiery talks on the lives of Shivaji Maharaj heavily laced with hatred for Muslims. And until the recent Bhima Koregaon violence, which Bhide is accused of inciting along with Milind Ekbote, he was not known to be anti-Dalit. Bhide's Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan is mainly known for training youths in physical education. Every year during Navratri, Bhide organises a marathon called \"Durga Daud\". Many prominent politicians in the past have graced the event. Not widely known outside Maharashtra, Bhide made national headlines in 2014 when Prime Minister  , during a 2014 Assembly election rally in Sangli, reportedly referred to the hardcore Hindutva activist as one of his inspirations. \"Bhide Guruji did not invite me here. I came here on his orders,” Modi had said during the rally,\" Modi had said. Those close to Bhide say the once-RSS pracharak split from the Sangh Parivar following difference of opinion with former RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras. Ever since then he has been busy running the Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan, albeit on the lines of the RSS. Much like the practice in RSS shakhas, we came to know, Bhide and his followers gather at their office every morning for workout sessions. We decided to catch up with him there. On a cold Friday morning, our team reached the Vishnu Ghat on the banks of river Krishna. A group of men had already begun their \"surya namaskar\" amid chanting of mantras. We were told that Bhide usually reaches by 5am. We kept waiting on the stairs of a temple watching another group of senior citizens practising laughter yoga. A while later, Bhide came riding his old bicycle. After greeting us, the first thing he asked us to do was to put aside our cameras. He then asked us to join us in his morning prayers and introduced us to others as \"guests of Sangli from Mumbai\". The prayers started with \"Jayatu Hindu Rashtram (long Iive the Hindu nation)\". While the prayers, offered to goddess Bhawani, praised Shivaji and Sambhaji, it was difficult to miss the religious undertones. After the prayers, the group got ready for another round of surya namaskar. Bhide, we were told, has added two additional surya mantras to the usual cycle in the name of Shivaji and Sambhaji. After we joined him in his workout and prayers, the man seemed comfortable talking to us. As soon as he is asked about the Bhima Koregaon violence, he vehemently claimed innocence and said it was a political conspiracy. He even appealed for a thorough inquiry into the incident. Giving examples from Mahabharata, he told us that even \"lord Krishna had to face allegations of theft\". As he got up to leave on his cycle cutting through a line of followers who had gathered to meet him, it was clear Bhide's no ordinary man.","title":"On meeting Bhima Koregaon violence accused Sambhaji Bhide","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/sambhaji-bhide-sangli-house-bhima-koregaon-dalit-atrocities-bhide-guruji-violence-hindutva/story/1/21569.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15338},{"author":"Sourish Bhattacharyya","content":"The manufactured outrage over the annual Dalit-led celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the  , unless seen through the pseudo-nationalist lenses, is yet another aggressive Hindutva attempt to muzzle the new Dalit voices that are becoming louder after the marginalisation of the likes of Mayawati and Ramdas Athawale. It is an expression of the venomous bigotry that drives the ill-informed Hindutva narrative - the very same bigotry that sparked off the Karni Sena anger against  , a film purportedly (I use the word deliberately because no one has seen it, apart from Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, outside the CBFC) based on an allegorical Sufi poem written in 1540 CE by a Muslim, Malik Muhammad Jayasi, about a fictional princess from Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka; note, she wasn't a Rajput), who becomes the queen of Chittor, and Allauddin Khilji falls in love with her. Understandably, the country has gone into election mode, and Hindutva loyalists have little to brag about after three and half years in power, except an economy where the fiscal deficit has spiralled out of control, jobs are hard to find, the farming sector is wracked by crises and prices of essential commodities showing no signs of abatement, even as Pakistan continues to kill and maim our braveheart soldiers in cold blood. There's only one way to deflect national attention away from the paralysis of equitable development that has set in. And the cynical strategy is to   to polarise voters - Hindus against Muslims and Christians, and the upper castes against Dalits. It started with the so-called \"love jihad\" and the alleged cow smugglers, but the virus, post-Gujarat Assembly elections, has infected the national discourse. Branding Rahul Gandhi as being anti-triple talaq bill when all his party, along with 17 others, has asked for is a parliamentary select committee review of one provision of the bill, is the latest expression of this nation-corroding argument. Questioning the legitimacy of Jignesh Mevani joining the annual celebrations of the Battle of Koregaon - the victory of a unit of the East India Company (comprising 900 Mahar soldiers) over the Peshwa Bajirao II's army in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, a commemoration whose history goes back to January 1, 1927, when BR Ambedkar started the tradition as an assertion of Dalit opposition to upper caste oppression, which had been institutionalised by the Brahminical Peshwas - is a strand of the same divisive narrative. Any Indian citizen can legitimately join a celebration, even it has political overtones, in any part of the country. If a Bhojpuri film star can represent North East Delhi and become the president of the BJP's Delhi unit, how can Jigesh Mevani be questioned for emerging as yet another national voice of the Dalits? Only those with a Peshwa mindset will parrot (reminds me of Padmavati's parrot in Jayasi's poem) such arguments, including the one linking Mevani with Umar Khalid, who, like any other Indian citizen, has the right to engage in a political or any other activity in any part of the country. This argument is as destructive as the mischievous misrepresentation of the acronym HAJ (Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh) formed with the first letters of the names of the three youth leaders who turned the political tide in Gujarat during the recent elections. Politics aside, let's turn to facts to make sense of the mayhem that just shook Maharashtra: 1) It was Chhatrapati Shivaji, who's much loved by the Hindutva army, who inducted Mahars into his army as scouts and guards of forts. 2) The tradition was discontinued by the Peshwas, who heaped inhuman insults upon the Mahars, like insisting that they have a broom tied to their back (to clear their footprints) and hang an earthen pitcher from their necks to prevent their shadow from \"polluting\" the streets. The celebration of the East India Company's victory in the Battle of Koregaon is not a homage paid to a colonial army, but an assertion of Dalit power against Brahminical oppression. 3) If the celebration of the Battle of Koregaon tantamounts to paying homage to colonialism, then the BJP, too, stands guilty of the same charge because of its opposition in Karnataka to Tipu Sultan, who fought the East India Company till his last dying moment. 4) After the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when British colonial generals, led by Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, floated the myth of the martial races, the Mahars were edged out of the British Indian Army and eventually the regiment bearing the name of the caste was disbanded in 1895. For the Mahars, the army provided an escape from their dehumanised life in a caste-oppressed society, which was why they kept demanding that their regiment be reinstated - a demand that was supported by Mahatma Gandhi's political guru, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and later, the Indian National Congress even though it was opposed to the army recruitment policies of the British Raj. 5) It was the British Indian Army that provided a caste-free upbringing to BR Ambedkar, whose father, Subedar Ramji Sakpal, was a teacher in the Mahar Regiment school at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. That may have been the reason why Ambedkar, as member of the viceroy's Defence Advisory Committee in 1941, made a strong pitch for the revival of the Mahar Regiment. 6) The viceroy accepted Ambedkar's plea and the first battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum in October 1941. In the years that followed until Independence, the regiment expanded steadily, saw action in Burma and Iraq, was among the first to become a machine gun regiment in 1946 (it was then that the Koregaon Victory Pillar, the scene of the January 1 celebrations, was replaced by two crossed Vickers machine guns on the regimental crest), and provided security to refugees during the Partition bloodbath. Post-Independence, it became a more integrative unit with the induction of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujaratis who were rejected as non-martial by the British. The Mahars today are 21 battalions strong and have produced two distinguished Army chiefs, General KV Krishna Rao and General K Sundarji. Most importantly, the regiment has given the community back the self-pride that the Peshwas had snuffed out. Hindutva bullies who don't want the Dalits to celebrate their moment of freedom are pursuing cynical electoral manoeuvres that can only lead to one loss - the inclusive idea of India that had been so caringly seeded by Jawaharlal Nehru and nurtured by all those who practise the politics of inclusion.","title":"Attack on Dalits celebrating the 200th anniversary of Battle of Koregaon is a forewarning on what's to come","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-dalits-hindutva-maharashtra-bandh-rss-jignesh-mevani-umar-khalid/story/1/21544.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15339},{"author":"Rajeev Sharma","content":"The real intentions of Pakistan behind the Christmas Day meeting between Kulbhushan Jadhav and his wife and mother - with a glass partition in between - have been exposed by Maulana Ameer Hamza, one of the founders of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). That the entire event was stage-managed by Pakistan to score brownie-points against India was revealed by Maulana Ameer Hamza at a public rally last week in Rawalpindi when he  : \"ISI and Pakistan government humiliated Jadhav's family during their visit to Islamabad. They also made Jadhav face his family across a glass wall… India had requested Pakistan to allow Jadhav’s mother and wife to meet him. Pakistan showed mercy and invited them. India thought that they would meet Jadhav face-to-face on a sofa, but the ISI didn’t allow it.” Hamza's boastful remarks indicate the following: 1) The meeting between Jadhav and his wife and mother was a charade, meant to humiliate the Jadhav family and send a wry message to India; 2) The existence of a nefarious nexus between the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Pakistan government and how the ISI choreographed the entire event though preparations for the meeting were largely between the foreign offices of the two countries; 3) The camaraderie between terror outfits and the Pakistani military establishment as Maulana Ameer Hamza was speaking at a public rally which couldn’t have taken place without the ISI's prior approval and the fact that he sought to lionise the ISI at the Rawalpindi rally. Does it not sound weird that the leader of a notorious terror outfit praises the host country’s premier intelligence agency? Such a scenario would have been shameful for any civilised nation, but in Pakistan it is a routine. It’s not for nothing that Pakistan is repeatedly hauled over the coals by the international community over terrorism, the latest in this never-ending series being extremely tough remarks against Pakistan by US President Donald Trump. Pakistan took the extreme measure of allowing Kulbhushan Jadhav to meet his mother and wife knowing that they needed to pre-empt any strictures being passed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On September 13, India submitted its written pleadings to the ICJ. Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, while responding to a question regarding the development, had stated that \"India has…submitted its memorial (written pleadings) to the ICJ in the Jadhav case involving egregious violation of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 by Pakistan. This is in furtherance of our application filed before the Court on May 8, 2017\". Earlier in May 2017, the ICJ had stayed Jadhav’s execution by Pakistan and had asked both parties to submit their written pleadings by September 13, 2017. Pakistani commentator Ejaz Haider had recently commented in an  : \"That Jadhav is important for India is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by New Delhi approaching the ICJ.\" One could counter that by saying thus: “That Jadhav is important to Pakistan is a no-brainer and can be evidenced by Pakistan constantly using him as a tool to pick on India sponsoring terrorism in Balochistan.”  The reality is that Pakistan got Jadhav on a platter and is using him to the hilt. It needs to be recalled that Jadhav was kidnapped in Iran and delivered to Pakistan by a faction of the Taliban working for Iran. The Taliban sold him to the Pakistanis for a price. And thereby hangs the tale. Pakistan first announced that they would accede to the Indian request to let Jadhav’s family meet him in Pakistan and promptly provided visas for the same on December 20, 2017. However, it is noteworthy that Pakistan did not grant consular access to any authorised personnel of the Indian Mission in Islamabad prior to the meeting, but instead only permitted the family to meet Jadhav. The meeting on December 25 was more of a charade than a meeting on humanitarian grounds. Importantly, the family was not allowed to converse in Marathi with Jadhav, to ensure that the Pakistanis could understand what exchange took place between the prisoner and his family. The family’s meeting with Jadhav, according to their own version, showed that Jadhav was under stress and spoke under coercion. Pakistan subsequently claimed that the procedure followed for the meeting, including asking the mother and wife to change their attire, had been agreed to by both countries in advance, a fact which India has firmly denied. Earlier in September last year, Pakistan's foreign minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, let out a canard that there was a   for a swap between Jadhav and a Pakistani who was involved in the Peshawar Army Public School attack and was said to be in Afghan custody. Asif claimed that India’s NSA Ajit Doval had told him that India could exchange that terrorist with the \"terrorist\" Pakistan had, namely Jadhav. Asif made these remarks while speaking at the Asia Society in New York, but the idea was quickly shot down by both India and Afghanistan. The issue of a swap may well have been discussed at some stage, but there appears to be no reason why Afghanistan should give their acquiescence to an Indian request to let off a known Afghan terrorist in their custody. Furthermore, if one goes back to reports of the terrorist strike at the APS Peshawar, there were six terrorists involved in the attack - one Chechen, two Afghans and three Arabs. In the rescue operation carried out by Pakistani Special Services Group, all six terrorists were killed. So who is this special guy the Afghans were holding on to as Asif claimed in September 2017? The mastermind of the Peshawar attack Omar Khorasani, was killed in a drone strike in October 2017. So much for Pakistan's claims of being the honest dealer and allowing India to meet with the family of commander Kulbhushan Jadhav. By the way, Jadhav is not a serving Indian Navy officer and had, in fact, retired in 2001. He had been working independently in Chahbahar Port in Iran since 2003. At the time of his arrest in March 2016, the Pakistani establishment planted a fake passport on him in the name of Hussein Mubarak Patel and claimed that he was a spy who had worked for India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) since 2013. The Pakistani narrative has always held that he is an active naval officer, a claim that appears false because of two things. First, India would not send a serving naval officer as an undercover agent to Iran. Second, if the officer was serving and had been posted to Chahbahar in uniform he would have diplomatic cover. Meanwhile, on December 25 last year, Iranian Parliament speaker Ali Larijani (a Shia country that the Sunni Pakistan is frantically trying to become close to), while addressing a news conference in Islamabad after attending a six-nation anti-terror conference in Islamabad, said: “Kulbhushan was doing business in Chahbahar and we had no information about him being a spy. The security institutions of both countries (Pakistan and Iran) had already exchanged information in this regard.” It is time for India to call Pakistan’s bluff and continue to work with the international community and increase pressure through the ICJ to get consular access to Jadhav. India must make all efforts to ensure that Jadhav is brought back to India alive. That would be a fitting honour for a former naval officer and an Indian national who deserves better than being a pawn in Pakistani hands.","title":"How ISI choreographed Kulbhushan Jadhav's meeting with family to humiliate India","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/kulbhushan-jadhav-wife-mother-meeting-mea-pakistan-let-isi/story/1/21526.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15340},{"author":"Romita Datta","content":"She had once called her \"Ma/Jangalmahal er Ma\" (mother, mother of Jangal Mahal). And the mother very often would tell others what a good girl she was. Often this mutual admiration would be on the dais of political rallies and government programmes in full public view. This was in 2011 and it continued for seven years as the mother's \"bhalo meye\" - or the good girl - obediently and with the right dosage of obeisance was toeing her line, fulfilling all her wishes and definitely becoming indispensable to her. The daughter in question is Bharati Ghosh, former SP of West Midnapore, and the mother is none other than Mamata Banerjee. Bharati, who was part of a UN peacekeeping mission for years and a former management student of Harvard, came to Bengal in 2011 and drew Mamata's attention after the latter took over as the chief minister of the state. From the state CID, she was made the SP of West Midnapore, which witnessed Maoist violence after 2008. Bharati, with her vast experience in war-torn places of Kosovo and Bosnia, was thought fit to tackle the Maoists. Like an efficient cop, she decimated the Maoists and was responsible for the death of their leader, Koteswar Rao, in a severe gun-battle. The other prominent Maoists operating in that area, and responsible for death of jawans in police camps, were wooed over with handsome packages, and the young turks who dreamt of a classless revolution were won over in the fold of the ruling party with posts, power and privileges. The backward areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore became free of not just the Maoist menace but of any dissenting voices. The districts surrendered and Mamata compensated with heavy doses of development, plugging all possibilities of a Maoist regrouping. And all this was largely possible because of Bharati Ghosh, who dared to be deadly different. Gradually, Bharati gained Mamata's confidence and according to the Opposition, she was less of a police officer and more of a party functionary. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in the 2016 Assembly polls, Bharati  . She was transferred by the EC from the SP's post for allegedly intimidating poll officers and overstepping her jurisdiction. In 2016, she was reprimanded for exceeding her brief and meeting political persons, especially Mukul Roy, then second-in-command of the Trinamool Congress, while model code of conduct was in place. The rap from the EC had no effect on Bharati as Mamata awarded her with prized posting, more power and punch, and greater responsibility. As Bharati went on antagonising Mamata's enemies, she scored brownie points in her career, obviously gaining in the confidence of the chief minister. But finally what soured the relation was Mukul Roy leaving the Trinamool Congress and joining the BJP. Bharati, known to be close and loyal to Roy, became a prime suspect in the eyes of the chief minister. As Roy started consolidating the base of the BJP in the Jungle Mahal area, there were rumours that Bharati was using her clout and muscle power to help him make deep inroads. The final nail in the coffin was the result of the by-election in Sabang in West Midnapore district. Though the Trinamool Congress won with a huge margin of over 67,000 votes and BJP came third, the latter increased its vote share by 17 per cent and that was enough to keep tongues wagging. The Congress-turned-Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Manas Bhuniya, who hailed from Sabang and was a strong critique of Bharati Ghosh since the time he was in the Opposition as a Congress MLA, saw this as an opportunity to turn Mamata against her \"good girl\". There were allegations from the district intelligence office that Bharati had held meetings with BJP leaders and was helping them improve their vote share. Logically, Bharati stood to gain by siding with the BJP. Mamata also had a hunch that Bharati would prefer to work for the party at the Centre given her ambition and career prospects. Immediately after the Sabang by-election results came out, Bharati was removed to an insignificant post as an officer of State Armed Police in Barrackpore. But Bharati   to the DG of police. While the resignation will help her think clearly on what should be the next step, it will also free her of her commitments to the service rules. She is threatening to open her mouth and settle scores. To swallow her resignation would mean handing over an ammo to BJP, since Bharati by virtue of being close to the ruling Trinamool Congress shared many secrets, especially the ones that the \"mother-daughter\" duo exchanged. Mamata has initiated an internal investigation against Bharati Ghosh to ensure she keeps mum, but given the stubborn daughter she is, Bharati might not buckle. Taking up the challenge of a duel, Bharati has also retorted saying that she too has a tale to tell. Any one listening?","title":"Why Mamata Banerjee and her 'cop daughter' Bharati Ghosh fell apart","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/mamata-banerjee-bharti-ghosh-2014-lok-sabha-elections-trinamool-congress-mukul-roy/story/1/21532.html","nationalist":"0.0","_deepnote_index_column":15341},{"author":"Kamlesh Sutar","content":"The usually peaceful celebrations at the Bhima Koregaon village every year to commemorate the battle of 1818, took an unusually   on January 1. The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a \"Bahujan\" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of \"Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak\" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and \"Gau-Brahman prati palak\" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as \"Rayate cha Raja\" (king of the ryots). \r\n \r\n Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ","title":"How Bhima Koregaon battle anniversary turned into a riot","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/bhima-koregaon-protests-dalits-killed-maharashtra-bjp-devendra-fadnavis-caste-politics/story/1/21500.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15342},{"author":"Aninda Dey","content":"Donald Trump may have forced   to cringe in his grave. The swashbuckling, swaggering playboy-US Congressman from Texas and   were brothers in arms literally - Pakistan was the conduit for channelling Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who finally started shooting down the lethal, much-feared Soviet Hind copters (Mi-24s) - or \"Shaitan-Arba\" (Satan’s Chariot) - with pinpoint accuracy in Afghanistan. As more planeloads of Stingers and other weapons landed in Pakistan, Wilson and Zia bonded closer. “Yes, Charlie did it,” remarked Zia after the Soviets met their Waterloo and made an ignominious exit. While Wilson loved Pakistan, he hated India. His hatred was evident when he dubbed India hypocritical and a satellite of the erstwhile Soviet Union in an interview with the Associated Press in 2003. “My general experience of Indians is that they are rather arrogant, know a lot more than anyone else about most things and are stiff-necked. Just like the Americans. But I noticed that they changed very quickly once the Soviets collapsed.” However, the Faustian pact the US had struck with the dreaded Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to counter the Soviets continued as Zia bled J&K under Operation Topaz with Uncle Sam turning a blind eye. The devilish deal would come back to haunt the US with Wilson’s rampaging \"Frankenstein\" in Afghanistan transforming itself into Godzilla - the very Mujahideen mutated into the Taliban and the ISI, under its rugged and foxy director Hamid Gul, nurtured the Taliban with Saudi money.   Washington continued to nurture the relationship with Pakistan and billions of dollars in aid flowed into the country. From 2002 to 2016, the US has provided more than $14 billion in aid to Pakistan with the highest assistance of $2,100 million in 2011 - the same year in which al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hunted down by the Navy Seal Team Six in a house close to Pakistan’s military academy in Abbottabad. The Afghan abyss still stares at the US. Trump blocking $255-million in military aid to Pakistan is perhaps the biggest jolt for Islamabad after Operation Neptune Spear in Abbottabad. Despite billions of dollars of aid, Pakistan and the ISI has been helping the Taliban, the Haqqani network, LeT and JeM. With the Islamic State (IS) entering Afghanistan, America faces a two-headed snake. Although the US has not given the specific reason for the aid blockade, Trump’s Afghanistan policy - which targeted Pakistan for not doing enough to rein in terrorists - and the threat from the IS and the LeT seem to have prompted the president.      As the IS is rapidly losing ground in Iraq and Syria, Afghanistan could be its next bastion. The threat of IS plotting attacks on the US in Afghanistan looms large. According to the New America Foundation, there have been several IS-inspired attacks on US soil. The IS had claimed responsibility for the attack on an exhibition of Prophet Muhammad cartoons in Garland, Texas, in 2015. In the first IS-inspired attack on US, the two attackers had been in touch with an online recruiter for the terror outfit. In the latest IS-inspired attack in October 2017, Uzbek   Sayfullo Saipov rammed a rented truck into pedestrians and cyclists near the World Trade Center, killing eight. In the worst terrorist attack since 9/11, the IS claimed responsibility for the Orlando gay nightclub attack in which   shot dead 50 people. Although the LeT primarily focusses on India, it poses threat to the US as well. Times Square bomber   was trained by the LeT in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Way back in 2013, Jonah Blank, senior political scientists at RAND Corporation, had raised the possibility of a 26/11-like attack in the US. She told the Committee on Homeland Security, “A Mumbai-style attack - that is, an attack dramatic and shocking enough to inspire widespread terror even without the use of weapons of mass destruction or a casualty-count in the thousands - remains a realistic near-term threat to the homeland. Such an attack might be termed, \"Boston Squared\" - that is, an attack similar to the   in April, but much larger in effect.” Stressing the LeT’s capability, experience and resourcefulness, Blank said the terror outfit had “enjoyed virtually open support from the Pakistani state throughout the 1990s, and has received at least tacit protection from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate since the group was officially banned by Islamabad in 2002”. Top al Qaeda commander Abu Zubaydah was captured in Faisalabad, Pakistan in 2002, in an LeT safe house. “Lashkar-e Taiba is a de facto affiliate of al Qaeda, and is believed to have joined Osama bin Laden's International Islamic Front for jihad sometime after the umbrella group's famous fatwa in 1998,” Blank added. Trump is riled by the continued ISI support to the Taliban and the Haqqani network, which has been frustrating US efforts to come out of the Afghan imbroglio. After more than 15 years and thousands of casualties, the US has failed to beat the battle-hardened Taliban, which now hold sway over 60 per cent of Afghanistan. ","title":"Trump blocking $255-mn aid is perhaps the biggest jolt to Pakistan after Abbottabad raid","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/trump-pakistan-zia-charlie-wilson-osama-bin-laden-abbottabad-isi/story/1/21507.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15343},{"author":"Anand Balasubramanian","content":"Actor Rajinikanth has launched a  as a quick follow-up to his big announcement of entering politics on December 31, 2017.  Leaving aside the fact that the website is as basic as it comes and looks cluttered, how far will this be helpful in taking his political career forward with the recruitment of new members is the real question. \r\n \r\n Online recruitment is not new in Indian politics. The Congress has an online membership form through which you can become a member of the party without visiting any of its offices. All you need is a copy of your voter ID card. The BJP takes this a step further and gives you an option between becoming a member and online aficionado of the party with portal user-only access. In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK and the DMK too allow online enrolment into the party. When it comes to reaching out to their followers, almost all big names have mobile apps. Even new entrants who are yet to launch their parties such as actors Kamal Haasan and Vishal have launched their own apps to connect with the people. While these apps and website will definitely be useful, will it really be a key player in inviting new members into the party? Well, yes. It will attract the current generation who are perpetually glued to their phone screens to join the party or their cause. The only issue is, how to convert these members into actual votes. When one had to visit an office, fill out a form and pay a membership fee, the person joining the party would have to have the intention and the will to join for him to put in that effort. If you belong to the left-wing political parties, you are expected to share a portion of your monthly purse with the party. You will be forced to make a conscious decision of following the ideology of the party and going out of your way before joining it. Even though this is not foolproof, it will at the very least ensure that the person who joins your party has the will to vote for you at the time of contributing to your vote share in the constituency.   When all you have to do is fill up four to five fields in an online form to join a party, you will not only attract the “why not” crowd, but also the mischievous, if not malicious elements. This could lead to embarrassing situations in the future since the party leadership would be answerable for their actions. It would also end up inflating the party numbers and giving false hope to the party leadership. Another question that the party needs to ask itself is if the numbers generated from online membership actually translate into votes in its favour. But make no mistake about it, apps and websites are absolutely essential in today’s age. It will help the party and the leader keep his cadre engaged. Providing an app to existing party members where they would need their party ID to login would help them keep their base consolidated. It will also keep them apprised of the party’s current stand on important issues, rally them for protests and even help them provide effective feedback to the party leadership on the local issues. However, the effectiveness of online recruitment of party members is something that is untested and may prove to be ineffective for a start-up party. If Rajinikanth plans to convert these members directly into party cadre en masse, he would have to be wary of the pitfalls that would ensue with the strategy. For, people who probably do not want to see Rajinikanth in politics, can use the website/app to infiltrate into the party and corrupt his base and image altogether. That is one danger the existing parties with consolidated base which use the app or website for communication is safe from.  ","title":"Should Rajinikanth's digital drive worry his political opponents?","url":"https://www.dailyo.in/politics/rajinikanth-political-party-online-recruitment-android-mobile-app-website/story/1/21509.html","nationalist":"nan","_deepnote_index_column":15344},{"author":"Manoj Joshi","content":"When it comes to the Modi government’s foreign policy record, you can see it as a glass half full or a glass half empty. Full or empty, it was half. It did not meet its full potential and there were more misses than hits, especially in the neighbourhood, in 2017. But there was one significant achievement which has made up for this and has important portents for the future. This was facing down Beijing over Doklam which was done with verve and sophistication. So what could 2018 bring? Perhaps its most important motif will be balance. Having stepped out in significant directions in 2015 and 2016 towards the US and Israel, Modi will seek to restore some equilibrium. He will seek to repair ties with China and reach out to Palestine, to signal to the Arab world that Indian policy is not changing. Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin Netanhayu is to visit India in mid-January for the Raisina Dialogue, but that is more about ideological signaling rather than achieving any major foreign policy goal. India is not a player in the Middle East, its primary interest is the stability of this vital region and it would be well advised to maintain its traditional posture of balancing between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the Saudi-Israel entente growing, there could be an argument for a slight tilt in the Iranian direction, else we may see a repeat of a situation where external pressures pushed our ally Russia into the arms of China. Note that Modi’s initiatives in the Gulf sheikhdoms are now paying. Following Modi’s visit in early 2017, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has invested nearly $3 billion (Rs 19,000 crore)in a range of areas relating to infrastructure and renewable energy. And this, say Indian diplomats in the region, is only the beginning. In 2018, significant developments could also take place in southeast Asia, beginning with the Indo-ASEAN commemorative summit on January, followed by New Delhi hosting all the ASEAN leaders collectively as chief guests at the Republic Day function. Modi’s expected speech at the Shangrila Dialogue in Singapore in early June will be important because it is being delivered at Asia’s premier security meet. This could be a harbinger of deepening Indian commitments in the region to balance China’s activism in South Asia. Having faced down Beijing in Doklam, India is in a good position to engage Beijing. Not much will come from this because issues between the two are not open to quick resolution. In recent years, they have displayed a dangerous tendency not to respond to the numerous CBMs that have kept peace between the two countries in recent decades. We now need newer mechanisms simply to ensure things do not get out of hand. If things go well, we could well see an acceleration of the steadily increasing Chinese investments in India topped off by a visit by Chinese supremo, Xi Jinping. The Chinese understand well that India is a huge opportunity for them. We could well see a negotiated settlement of the Sino-Indian impasse over the Belt and Road Initiative. It is in the context of China that India also needs to pay attention to Russia in 2018. There has been significant activity on the official front in 2017, but a visit by President Putin for the annual consultative summit could restore some vitality to the relationship. Our most important tie will remain the one with the US. It will also be the most problematic. It has so far been Washington’s best managed foreign relationship, but it could rub up against Indian interests relating to Iran and Russia. However, there is every indication that the US is willing to give New Delhi considerable leeway here because its need for India’s weight in the “Indo Pacific” region is significant. And what about Pakistan? There is unlikely to be much of a shift here, considering Pakistan has no real government at present and, perhaps, more important, it remains a useful electoral tool for Modi. He is also likely to visit Davos for the World Economic Forum summit. At first sight, it looks like an attempt to catch up with Jinping who was the chief guest last year. Symbolic attendance at Davos won’t change things. The economy is not going anywhere for a while and Modi must take the blame for that. New Delhi does appear to be in a sweet spot of sorts because of American friction with Pakistan and China. This could grow, for differing reasons, in 2018. This can provide sufficient space to further India’s interests. This is where the rub comes in. It is now widely accepted that Indian economy slowed down on account of self-inflicted wounds in 2017. Hopefully, Modi and his team will not do a repeat in the arena of foreign policy.

The two incidents might appear extremely different on the face of it but both of them highlight a very significant problem within Indian society. By any measure, the Faridabad incident and the Munger shooting are indeed absolutely shocking.\n\nWe are living in a culture of denial of the obvious. We have made denial of reality the cornerstone of our worldview. Even though all of us are well aware of the truth, we will go to extraordinary lengths to pretend otherwise during public life. For instance, we are well aware that on the best of days, the Police are perceived as people to be avoided at all costs.\n\nThere are the much vaulted arguments about police reforms. One would expect the number 1 priority on that list would be reforming the culture that has come to dominate our police force but somehow, it is never on the agenda. There needs to be far more accountability for the police and far stricter punishment for dereliction of duty. Most of all, it is necessary for everyone to see that justice is being done.\n\nThere is no point in blaming the Police alone. Our systems work because there are great men and women working in the government, the bureaucracy, the Judiciary and the Police who manage to compensate for the systemic flaws just enough so as to ensure that the edifice could be maintained. The system itself is rotten to the very core.\n\nThe Munger shooting is the most obvious in a series of incidents that reflect the utter moral depravity of the secular state. First of all, the Election Commission of India reserved the 28th of October for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly Elections. Either they were not aware of the specific traditions of Munger or they did not believe they were important enough. In either case, it reflects their remarkable incompetence.\n\nThen, the Police suddenly discovered their bravado while dealing with Hindu devotees. There are different versions of what precisely happened but there are videos that suggest that the Police used brutal force against the devotees when they took out a procession for the Visarjan at around midnight on the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe Police apparently thrashed the devotees which sparked a protest that ultimately led to the death of one and critical injuries for six others. Ideally, the entire team of police officials responsible for the madness should be suspended prior to an investigation and charges related to murder ought to be invoked if some of them are found guilty for the death of the Hindu devotee.\n\nThe brutal murder of the Hindu devotee, and that is what it precisely was, highlights a very salient aspect that has been hitherto ignored. Genuine Police reforms ought to be the concern of every concerned Hindu and reforming the culture of the Police is an extremely Hindu issue. Because ultimately, it is the Hindu masses who suffer the most due to police brutality.\n\nThe Police is too afraid to act against even genuine criminals from minority Abrahamic communities because they are actually scared for their lives. It is the law-abiding Hindus which bear the brunt of their brutality as it is against the weak that the bullies discover their strength all of a sudden. And make no mistake, the ordinary masses of all communities are weak.\n\nSome compensate for it by building tight-knit communities where ‘One for All, All for One’ is the motto. Those communities that fail to do so have to suffer the consequences for their lack of organisation. We cannot afford to live in a culture of denial of the obvious anymore about the actual extent of malfeasance within the Police. And until the Police is reformed, the Hindu masses will continue to suffer and pious devotees will continue to be slaughtered.\n\nImagine the monstrosity of the whole situation. Hindu devotees embark on the annual Visarjan procession and in the way, they are brutalised by the Police and one of them even loses their lives. And yet, after a few days, the same governments which cannot adequately punish and reform the rot that has set in within government institutions will attempt to reform Hindu society itself. It is quite disgraceful.\n\nThe culture of denial is again prominent in the murder of Nikita Tomar in Faridabad. The 21-year old was shot dead in broad daylight by two men outside the Aggarwal college in Ballabgarh. The two accused fled the scene after committing the murder. One of the accused, Taufeeq, appears to have been an obsessive stalker of the girl who murdered her when she refused his advances.\n\nThere is no point in denying here that significant sections of the Muslim community harbour opinions that are radically at odds with the mandate of civil society. Reports have emerged which suggest that the victim was being coerced into converting to Islam and marry the accused which she was resisting. And hence, she was murdered.\n\nInstead of speaking out against this menace, our cultural institutions are busy promoting nonsense such as the Tanishq ad which actually leads to the death of Hindu women. In this particular instance, it was a case of Islamist murder but there have been too many occasions in the past when Muslim boys have lured Hindu women by forging false identities and subsequently murdered them when their actual identity was discovered.\n\nThe two incidents highlight the fact that we cannot afford to live in a culture of denial anymore. It leads to the actual death of ordinary Hindu citizens who want nothing more than to live in peace. The elites might delude themselves by intricate fantasies but the masses do not have the luxury of entertaining such delusions.\n\nUntil we rid ourselves of the culture, ordinary Hindu citizens will continue to be murdered with impunity and without any consequences when all they want to do is participate in the Visarjan of their beloved deity. Until we rid ourselves of the culture, we will continue to have murders like that of Nikita Tomar who had to forfeit her life because she did not wish to marry a psychopath.\n\nBoth these incidents are heart-breaking, to put it mildly. But there are lessons from them that Hindus must learn. Until the appropriate lessons are learnt, such incidents will continue to occur with an obscene frequency. The unfortunate deaths of both Nikita Tomar and the Hindu devotee in Munger should only strengthen our resolve to ensure the reformation that we seek in our institutions and public life.\"\"\",'title':'Two Hindu families see the death of the child, one because she dared to refuse Islam, one, because he wanted to bid goodbye to Maa', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/10/munger-shooting-faridabad-murder-nikita-tomar-bihar/', 'nationalist': 1}\n\n\nwilson_new_row2 = {'author': 'Abhishek Banerjee', 'content': \"\"\"Earlier this month, the French President Emmanuel Macron took the stage at city hall in the Paris suburb of Les Mureaux to deliver one of the most consequential speeches of his career. A series of policy pledges to tackle what he calls Islamic separatism.\n\nIncidentally, the day that Macron chose for this announcement was Oct 2. It is not clear whether the French President meant this deliberately as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. However, two things are clear. First, the speech involves a level of plain speaking that is quite unusual for a head of state. Second, the speech completely changes the way France (and potentially the rest of Europe and even the West) looks at Islam.\n\nThe following is a collection of some of the upshots from the speech, translated loosely into English. We shall not go into details of his policy announcements, which are very specific to domestic governance in France. Rather, we will look at the introduction to the speech, where Macron explains what he has set out to do and why. The full text of the nearly hour long speech, in French, is available from the French Government website [pdf].\n\n“Who has put the Republic in danger?”\n\nThe French President lays it out thus:\n\n“There are two objectives for why I am speaking to you today. The first is to define the reality of our problems without any taboos. Who is it today, in our society, that has put our Republic in danger and our ability to coexist? The second is to share with you the decisions made by the government on how to tackle the situation. These decisions are the result of careful consideration of nearly 3 years.”\n\n“The problem is not secularism”\n\nThe President laid this out firmly:\n\n“The problem is not secularism. I have said many times that secularism in France means the freedom to believe or not to believe and to worship however you want, subject to public order. Secularism means the neutrality of the state and does not mean that religion must be erased from the public sphere. Secularism is the glue that holds France together.”\n\nIn France, they take secularism (in French: laïcité) with overwhelming seriousness. The state maintains the strictest possible distance from religion, bans all religious symbols in government buildings including public schools and forbids public servants from wearing them.\n\nA bit of historical context is needed here. The French Revolution saw religious authorities as part of the complex that supported the tyranny of the king. The 1789 revolution was followed with the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It explicitly rejected religion as the basis of government and laid the foundation for modern secular law. At the time, the US had just finished fighting the revolutionary war, in which France had been their ally against British colonial rule. The Declaration inspired the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution and was also the basis of the UN’s declaration of universal human rights in the 20th century.\n\n“Islamic separatism aims to form a counter-society“\n\nThe President describes his opponent thus:\n\n“It is Islamic separatism that we have to attack. Islamic separatism is a conscious effort, a politico-religious one. It repeatedly breaks with the values of the Republic and aims to form a counter-society. This takes the form of taking kids out of school, developing sports and cultural communities that become an excuse for teaching principles that do not conform to the laws of the Republic. This indoctrination negates our principles such as equality of men and women and the dignity of the human being.“\n\nA “counter-society” that does not respect the dignity of the individual. Ouch!\n\n“First it forms a parallel society, but its ultimate aim is to take over“\n\nThe President explains further:\n\n“The problem is this ideology which believes that its laws are superior to those of the Republic. I have often said that people are free to believe or not to believe, but every citizen, with or without religious belief, must absolutely respect the laws of the Republic. And let us name it and tackle it : it is in Islamic separatism that we find a desire and a methodical organization to destroy the laws of the Republic and create in its place a parallel system, based on different values and a different organization of society. At first, this is only a parallel society, but the ultimate aim is to take control of everything.“\n\nI warned you. This level of plain speaking is unusual for a modern head of state.\n\n“Islam is in crisis all over the world“\n\nThe President gave his personal view\n\n“A lot has been written, said and analyzed in this regard, about what our country is facing right now. I have the humility to admit that I am no specialist, but let me tell you in a few words what I think. Islam is a religion which is in crisis all over the world. This is not just happening in France, this hardening of attitudes is happening all over the world, including in countries where Islam is the majority religion. Just see the example of our friend Tunisia, how different it was thirty years ago. And Tunisia is one of the most educated and developed in that part of the world….“\n\nAnd with this, President Macron went on to lay out his ideas for tackling the problem as he saw it. For instance, requiring that all kids must attend public school, instead of possible indoctrination via “home schooling.” Closing down places of worship that are suspected of spreading radicalization. A national effort to shut down establishments that have practices that violate core French values, such as gender equality, for example by having different times for men and women to use a swimming pool. He would also crack the whip on elected officials, who might “compromise” on these values in certain neighborhoods, due to pressure from the local public.\n\nWhile Macron’s speech did not receive the kind of attention you would expect, possibly due to English being the language of global discourse, the usual suspects did cry out.\"\"\", 'title': 'Islam is in crisis all over the world” and all the other things the French President said', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/10/emmanuel-macron-samuel-paty-islam-speech/','nationalist': 1}\n\nwilson_new_row3 = {'author': 'Jinit Jain', 'content': \"\"\"A two-day national symposium on ‘Memories of 22 October 1947’ is being organised in Kashmir by the National Museum Institute in collaboration with the Union Territory Government of Jammu and Kashmir on October 22 and October 23, 2020, to mark the violence and atrocity faced by residents following the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan’s Pashtun tribal militias, aided by the Pakistani military.\n\nAhead of the national symposium, billboards have been put up at several places in Srinagar to inform people about the exhibition and create awareness among them about the horrors meted upon their ancestors by the invading Pakistani intruders on October 22, 1947(Black Day).\n\n\nBillboard informing J&K residents about invasion of Kashmir by Pakistani militias on October 22, 1947(Black Day)\n“A museum or an exhibition will become one of the platforms to document, reconstruct and to bring alive the historic narrative of October 22, 1947.

The said exhibition or memorial will be the first of its kind in this direction,” the official statement by the organisers as quoted by ANI said.\n\nThe official statement also added that it is important to present such a historic narrative to the people in order to have a dialogue with them. It sought to clear hazy sense of history some people in Kashmir had, especially with regards to Pakistan’s claim on the territory. The statement said that people should be aware of the challenges faced by the nation just months after securing independence.\n\n\nBillboard informing J&K residents about invasion of Kashmir by Pakistani militias on October 22, 1947(Black Day)\n“Pakistan invaded Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947, and brought in its wake horrifying mass plunder and vandalism. Thousands of men, women and children were mercilessly slaughtered by the intruders. Four days later, on October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession, merging his state with India. Following the accession of the state to India, Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar, the state capital to repel the tribal invasion,” the statement noted.\n\nPakistan Army launched ‘Operation Gulmarg’ to snatch Jammu and Kashmir\nSoon after the partition, the Pakistani leadership, both civilian and military, was desperate and determined to expand its territorial area. Several attempts were made by Pakistani leaders, including Mohammad Ali Jinnah to convince Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir to accede to Pakistan. However, Singh had remained adamant on his demand to have an independent princely state.\n\nSoon after the independence, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called ‘Operation Gulmarg‘ and put it into action. According to the plan, 20 Lashkars (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribals, were to recruited from various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. The armed Lashkars were expected to reach their launching point in Abbottabad on October 18, and subsequently cross into Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947. The primary objective of the Operation was to capture Srinagar by October 26, 1947.\n\nThe 20 Lashkars were to be divided into a group of 2—10 militia tribes were expected to attack the Kashmir Valley through Muzaffarabad and the remaining ten were expected to join the rebels in Poonch, Rawalkot and Bhimber from where they were to advance to Jammu.\n\nBLACK DAY\n\nOn this day, Lashkars armed with axes, swords & guns backed by #Pakistan Army attacked Jammu & Kashmir.

Akbar Khan, who was entrusted with the operation, devised a plan to make the Kashmir rebellion appear like a revolt waged by the people of Jammu and Kashmir against their non-Muslim rulers. The aim here was to take the cover of civilian unrest for the impending military action. Through a concerted attempt, rebellion against Maharaja Hari Singh was ginned up and rebels were encouraged to take up arms against the Hindu ruler.\n\nAs a prelude to this plan, Pakistan stopped the supply of essential goods like petrol, oil, food, sugar, salt etc. to Jammu and Kashmir, effectively blockading the state and thereby actively stoking rebellion against Maharaja Hari Singh.\n\nPakistani Pashtun tribal militias and Pakistani Army regulars invade Jammu and Kashmir\nThe weeks of planning and illicit manoeuvrings under Operation Gulmarg culminated into the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir which marked the commencement of the events that led to the first Indo-Pak war. In the wee hours of October 22, 1947, scores of Pakistani Pashtun tribal militias, in connivance with the Pakistani state and army surreptitiously crossed the border from Garhi Habibullah into Jammu and Kashmir and attacked the town of Muzaffarabad.\n\nSeveral accounts claim that the tribal raiders, raised by the Pakistani Army, were aided by the traitors of the 4 KI guarding the outposts at Lohar Gali and Ramkot. Many Muslim forces tasked with protecting the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir mutinied and colluded with the rampaging Pashtun tribesmen to defeat the forces deployed by Maharaja Hari Singh.\n\nThese rebels provided crucial information to the armed raiders about the troop deployment and position and helped them prevail over them. Even before the sleeping residents of Muzaffarabad could realise, the town was already under the control of invading Pashtun militias. Documented accounts state that hundreds of women were raped and abducted, houses looted and men slaughtered on the streets.\n\nAfter wreaking havoc in Muzaffarabad, the Pashtuns marched towards the prosperous town of Baramulla, even though the path to Srinagar was clear. Here too, the Pashtuns killed innumerable men and women, looted houses and then set them on fire. Out of 14,000 population at the time, less than two thousand had remained. Most of them were either killed in the Pashtun onslaught or fled the village for safer places.\n\nThe ‘Lashkars’ wreaked havoc, killed, raped and looted Hindus and Muslims alike\nThe invading tribal groups had no regard for anyone. They ran riot, leaving chaos, destruction and killings in their wake. They even raped nuns, who were performing their duties at St. Joseph Hospital and schools in Baramulla. Even doctors, paramedics, and nurses tending to the sick and incapacitated were not spared. They were, too, subjected to a brutal assault by the invading tribesmen.\n\nAs Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani regular army soldiers were busy looting Kashmiris in Baramulla, defiling their women and vandalising the properties, Maharaja Hari Singh sought an intervention from India to stop the devastation, which was contingent upon his signing of Instrument of Accession.\n\nAfter Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India on October 26, 1947, the Indian Armed forces were airlifted to the Kashmir Valley the next day. The Army launched an aggressive offence against the rampaging Pashtuns and stopped their march towards Srinagar. In the subsequent months, the Indian Army purged the state of the Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani regulars and forced them to retreat to what is present-day Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.\n\nFor years, Pakistan perpetuated the myth that tribal raiders were liberators who had come to Kashmir to fulfil their religious obligation of jihad and avenge the deaths of Muslims killed in the communal riots in Jammu. However, in reality, the tribesmen were not carrying out any religious war or jihad. They were there to brazenly trample upon the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir, rape and dishonour the women, plunder and pillage Kashmiri, regardless of their religion.\n\nThey were aided, provided and instigated by the regulars in the Pakistani army. Whose motive, to this day, remains to add the region of Jammu and Kashmir to the territory of Pakistan and push India’s northern border further down.\"\"\", 'title': 'October 22, 1947: The day when Pakistan-backed tribal Lashkars invaded Jammu and Kashmir to plunder, rape and destroy','url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/10/october-22-1947-when-pakistani-army-lashkars-invaded-jammu-and-kashmir-to-plunder-rape-and-destroy/', 'nationalist': 1}\n\nwilson_new_row4 = {'author': 'Nivan Sadh', 'content' : \"\"\"The caste system of social hierarchy is a phenomenon not unique to just the Hindus of South East Asia, but is seen in many other religions and communities in the continent. Often ignored by the media and Muslim leaders, there is wide scale discrimination present in Muslim society between two factions- Ashraf and Ajlaf.\n\nThe Muslim society divides itself into two categories- The decendendents of Arab or other invading groups (also called ‘Ashraf’) and the local converts (known as ‘Ajlaf’). Though the Qur’an doesn’t mandate the creation of such groups, these terminologies emerged when the Islamic invaders from the west attacked and conquered portions of the Indian subcontinent, and converted local Hindus at the tip of the sword. Apart from this divide, there exists a Hindu varna-system among the Ajlaf category of Muslims, which is based on the caste they/their family belonged to before converting to Islam (eg- Muslim Rajputs).\n\nOn top of the Muslim caste hierarchy lie the Syeds, who are considered to be the direct descendants of Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Syeds have traditionally married within their caste and usually don’t marry someone outside of their community (for example, the Pathans). The Syeds are believed to be descendants of Husayn Ibn Ali, the grandson of Islamic prophet Muhammad, while the descendants of Hasan Ibn Ali (brother of Husayn) are called ‘Shareefs’. The two communities are often at the forefront of Muslim social hierarchy and are very influential in Islamic society.\n\nAt the bottom of the Muslim society are the Pasmandas of the Ajlaf category, who comprise of ‘Shudra’ and adivasi converts. Persion word for ‘those who have fallen behind’, the Pasmandas are the most discriminated group within Indian Muslims. Comprising of 85% of the total Indian Muslim population, the Pasmandas are politically the least represented group within the Muslim community in India.\n\nOnline news portal Firstpost published an article by Ajaz Ashraf in 2019, who spoke about the rampant discrimination against the Pasmanda community amongst Indian Muslims. According to Ajaz Ashraf, around 7,500 MPs were elected between the First and the Thirteenth Lok Sabha. Of them, 400 were Muslim and only 60 of the Muslim parliamentarians were from the Pasmanda community. The Ashrafs, though just 2.01 percent of India’s population, represented 4.5% of the seats between the First and Thirteenth Lok Sabha.\n\nThere have been several reports of discrimination against the Pasmanda community by upper caste Sharifs. According to the same Firstpost article cited above, writer Ajaz Ashrah witnessed that there were separate ‘lottas’ of drinking water for the Dalit Halalkhors (sweeper caste) and Mehtar castes in Muslim dominated areas. Similarly, there was clear discrimination in mosques where the upper caste muslims prayed in the front rows while the lower caste muslims prayed in back rows. In some places, Dalit Muslims are not allowed to access public burial grounds reserved for the Ashrafs.\n\nIslam, as a religion, has also resorted to such discrimination when the topic of ‘Caliphate’ arises. According to the Hadith, only a member of the Quraysh tribe (to which Mohammed belonged) could be the Islamic caliph. This is a sharp contradiction to the carols of ‘equality between believers’ the Qur’an brags of in its verses.\n\nThe Print has also accepted the existence of a caste system in Muslim society, though hilariously denouncing the caste system as a “Brahminical disease” in the first line of its article while referring to caste system amongst Muslims. The Print alleges that members of the Ashraf community hijack the politics of Muslim society during elections by declaring votes towards them as an Islamic duty, and taunt the Pasmanda members who stand as candidates.\n\nOn the 1901 caste census in British India, Dr BR Ambedkar had opined, “The Muslims do not realise that these are evils and consequently do not agitate for their removal. Indeed, they oppose any change in their existing practices”. (Ref: Pakistan or the Partition of India, pp. 218-223)\n\nAmbedkar had further stated, “Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. Regarding slavery nothing needs to be said. It stands abolished now by law…But if slavery has gone, caste among Muslims has remained…There can thus be no manner of doubt that the Muslim Society in India is afflicted by the same social evils as afflict the Hindu Society”.\n\nThis proved that Dr BR Ambedkar was not a fan of the Indian Muslim community, and had realised that the caste system was rampant amongst them as well. This played a pivotal role in his decision to adopt Buddhism as the standard faith for his Dalit followers.\n\nIn 2016, the BBC had published a report on the ‘untouchable’ Muslims. According to the report, when “Dalit Muslim” respondents were requested to share their experiences inside homes of upper-caste Hindus and Muslims, around 13% of them reported having received food/water in different utensils in “upper-caste” Muslim houses. Similarly, 8% of “Dalit Muslim” respondents report that their children are seated in separate rows in classes and also during school lunches.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz is at the forefront of politically mobilising the lower caste Muslims in North India. There have been several chants of equality by the lower caste Muslims against the Syedist patriarchy that is practised in Muslim society.\n\nDespite the rampant discrimination, negligible political representation and strategized alienation from Muslim society, the plea for help by the lower caste Muslims is left unanswered by the largely upper-caste Muslim political organizations, and shall soon be eliminated if the lower caste Muslims stand up to the Ashrafs.\"\"\", 'title': 'The social hierarchy of Muslim society: Is the caste system a problem unique to Hindus?', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/10/muslim-social-hierarchy-caste-system-ajlaf-ashraf/','nationalist': 1}\n\nwilson_new_row5 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'content': \"\"\"In a shocking display of intolerance and bigotry, a group of radical Islamists attacked over 10 Hindu families on Sunday at Korbanpur village under Muradnagar Upazila in the Comilla district of Bangladesh.\n\nAs per reports, the Hindu households were selectively vandalised and later set on fire after a man allegedly expressed solidarity with France and defended the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in Facebook comments.

The British gave the remaining princely states a choice to merge with either unions or stay independent. One of the largest princely states within the Indian union was Hyderabad, a Hindu-majority region ruled by a Muslim Nizam.\n\nThe Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, was in a dilemma on whether he should join the Indian union or stay independent. On the other hand, the Majlis-e-Itihadul Muslimeen (precursor of present-day AIMIM) was adamant on the Nizam merging with Pakistan instead of being Independent. Being no more than a puppet to the MIM, the Nizam agreed to keep Hyderabad independent of either unions.\n\nThough the Nizam tried to legitimise the Princely state of Hyderabad by appointing trade officials in European countries and sending delegations to the UNSC, there were civil movements within his territory led by Arya Samaj, Hindu Mahasabha and Hyderabad State Congress to fight for Hindu rights in Hyderabad and merge the state with the Indian Union.\n\nFearing an uprising by the majority-Hindu community of the Hyderabad State, the Nizam sanctioned the creation of Razakars led by Kasim Razvi, which was to be a paramilitary wing of the MIM. The Nizam gave Razakars the power to suppress Hindu uprisings and movements by whatever means possible, in a bid to save his own skin.\n\nThe Razakars, after getting the green signal from the Nizam, started an ethnic genocide of Hindus in Rural Telangana (which is predominantly Hindu). The Razakars were committed to mass conversions of Hindus to Islam in an attempt to make Hyderabad a Muslim majority province. The Razakars went village-to-village and mass-murdered, raped and kidnapped several Hindu villagers.\n\nOne such incident is that of Veera Bairanpalli, a village in Telangana which was at the receiving end of the Razakars. The Jihadi forces had tried to enter the village to mass convert Hindu residents thrice, but were unsuccessful when the residents chased the invaders with slings and other crude weapons.\n\nHowever, the Razakars led by Kasim Razvi managed to infiltrate the village with the help of the Nizam on their fourth attempt during the festival of Bathukamma. At the borders of the village lied a mud fort which the villagers used to guard themselves from the Jihadis, the Razakars shot all the guards at point blank range and proceeded to massacre the unarmed villagers.\n\nOn entering the village premises, the Razakars stripped Hindu girls off their clothes and paraded them naked, followed by making them dance to their tunes as a sign of submission and surrender to Islamic superiority. Hindu women were raped mercilessly with the men shot dead. Several villagers jumped into open wells present in agricultural fields to escape the terror. Many temples were also plundered by the Razakars.\n\nRecently, The Hindu interviewed an 80 year old Charan Chandra Reddy who is one of the sole survivors of the massacre. At the time of Jihadi invasion, Reddy was a guard posted at the mud fort bordering the village and had narrowly escaped getting killed. “The Razakars killed 96 people in Bhairanpally that day. They raped women, paraded them naked and snatched away gold ornaments from them. As the brutes chased, the villagers ran helter skelter and some even died jumping into the open wells in agricultural fields,” Reddy told The Hindu in 2017.\n\nSome of the Razakar forces were shot dead by the villagers, which enraged Kasim Razvi and escalated the massacre. The Razakars rounded up the villagers and shot them dead after lining them up, in an attempt to save bullets. A survivor of this incident, N. Mallaiah, told The Hindu in 2016, “They plundered everything. The armed men molested women, killed sheep and killed able-bodied men just for pleasure. They looted every village en route.”\n\n“To save bullets, they lined us up and shot. The bullet missed me and went through my left hand. Thinking that I am dead, they threw me on the heap of dead bodies”, he further said. A resident named Dasari Pulliah added to Mallaiah’s statement, “Many of us climbed onto the mud fort which has been there since times immemorial. We took shelter and fired at the Razakars. We killed some of them and that enraged Kazim Rizvi who was controlling the Razakars”.\n\nA similar incident happened at Perumandla Sankeesa, a village in the Warangal district of Telangana. Between 1947-1948, the Razakars invaded the village three times with ecalating wrath each time they attacked the village. On 1st September 1948, the village saw the most bloodthirsty form of the Razakars, who came looking for the guerrilla forces that attacked the Nizam’s officials regularly and hid in the forests surrounding the village. The Jihadi army tortured villagers while interrogating them about the whereabouts of the guerrilla leaders and raped Hindu women under broad daylight.\n\nOne of the villagers who survived the attack was Chitti Komalu, a 99 year old resident of the village who gave an interview to The Hindu on the Razakar attacks. He was quoted saying, “The Razakars raided our village three times in six months in 1947 and 1948. I was caught alive and hanged upside down. They tortured me seeking the whereabouts of Thumma Seshaih, the commander of armed squad in this area. I was sent to jail for one and half years at Warangal, Gulbarge and Jalna. I was released after six months of police action that led to Telangana liberation and merger with Indian Union”.\n\n“Women ran away on seeing the Razakars and hid in maize fields. But they were chased and hunted down by the Razakars and raped openly in broad daylight,” he further said.\n\nThe Razakars continued their barbaric campaign till the Indian army routed their forces with Operation Polo in 1948, leading to the liberation of Hyderabad from Nizam’s control and accession to the Indian Union. These incidents highlight the sacrifices made by Telangana villagers to ensure the survival of Hinduism in present day Telangana. Remembering their sacrifices will honour those who lost their lives in these barbaric attempts to erase Hinduism from the face of Deccan India.\"\"\",'title': 'The muffled voices of Hyderabad: Unaccounted reports of mass genocide of local Hindus under the Nizam', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/10/hindu-genocide-nizam-of-hyderabad-razakars/', 'nationalist': 1}\nwilson_new_row9 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff','content': \"\"\"Turkish media on Monday claimed that a pig’s head was left in Grand Mosque in the city of Compiegne in Oise. These claims were made by Turkish Muslim umbrella group DITIB (Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs). This report comes after Turkey accused France of ‘Islamophobia’ after France condemned the beheading of its citizens by hands of Islamic terrorists over ‘blasphemy’. Interestingly, the reports of pig head found in mosque are only claimed by DITIB. French media or authorities have not yet confirmed the incident.\n\nWhat is DITIB\nDITIB is a controversial Turkish Muslim group founded in Germany. It manages over 900 mosques in Germany and has over 8 lakh members. As per official research service for the German Bundestag, that has created a register of Islamic organizations in Germany, its charter states that DITIB is “linked to the Turkish government’s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet).”\n\nAs per the report, the Diyanet sends imams to mosques affiliated with DITIB. The salaries of the Imams are paid by Turkish consulate generals. Diyanet determines what is the theological guidelines on what is preached in the mosques under DITIB. The Diyanet is state body for administration of religious affairs and answers directly to Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe Diyanet reportedly has an annual budget of over €1 billion ($1.17 billion), which is more than Turkey’s Interior or Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn March this year, the German federal state of Hesse ended its cooperation with DITIB because they had doubts of DITIB’s independence from Turkish state. In May 2019, former German intelligence chief had alleged that the DITIB Imams are working for the Turkish intelligence. In January 2019, German media reported that the organisation had close contacts with alleged Islamists of Muslim Brotherhood in Germany.\n\nFrance vs Turkey\nDays after French President made the ‘Islam is in crisis’ speech calling out Islamic terrorism, Turkey President Erdogan had said that Macron needs ‘treatment’. Days later, a French teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded for showing a Charlie Hebdo caricature of Prophet Muhammad to his class. This was followed by other beheadings by terrorists shouting Allahu Akbar as France continued to call out Islamic terror attack.\n\nAmid such terror attacks, Turkish media has cited Turkish Muslim group accused of espionage, on reports of ‘pig’s head found in mosque’ in France.\"\"\",'title': 'Pig head in mosque in France?” Controversial Turkey Muslim group cries ‘Islamophobia’ over unconfirmed reports in Turkish media', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/11/pig-head-mosque-france-turkey-unconfirmed-reports/', 'nationalist': 1}\nwilson_new_row10 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff','content': \"\"\"In the Motipur area of Bahraich district, Uttar Pradesh, one Nasiruddin and his accomplices attacked a house of Dalit for rearing pigs.

Since then, French President Emmanuel Macron has described the incident as a terrorist attack. However, recently, an Islamic scholar went on to normalise this harrowing act by saying that the Muslim teen had not committed any serious crime.\n\nIn an interview to a Turkish TV channel, Sheikh Ali Al-Yousuf of the International Union of Muslim Scholars recently said that from the perspective of Islamic jurisprudence, the Chechen teen had “not done any serious crime”. According to the Islamic scholar, the teen did not do anything that offensive that he should be punished for according to the sharia law.\n\n‘The only punishment for insulting the Prophet is death’\nAccording to Al-Yousuf, the only punishment for insulting the Prophet is death. The only fault of the Muslin teen was that he carried out the punishment by himself. According to sharia, the punishment should be carried out by the Islamic State, said the Islamic scholar.\n\n“As I told you, if it is proven that the person who did this is a Chechen Muslim, and he did this out of anger because of the violation of the Prophet Muhammad’s honor, and if he indeed was a Muslim who did this in defense of the Islamic shari’a, then we let Allah be his judge. He may have carried out the punishment mandated by Islamic jurisprudence”.\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist talking to the Turkey TV channel said that people should instead focus on the reason that forced the teen to do what he did. Normalising the crime committed by the 18-year-old teen, Al-Yousuf said that it was the growing ‘Islamophobia’ in France and elsewhere in the world which was prompting such extreme reactions, like in the case of the French teacher.\n\nBlames ‘Islamophobia’\n“Anyone who follows what is happening in France – the attacks against Islam and Muslims, and especially what we have seen lately – will see that there is an obvious media, political, cultural, and ideological campaign against Islam, Muslims, and the Prophet Muhammad, against every Muslim individual, as well as Muslim symbols, like the hijab. All this is crystal clear – it is called Islamophobia.\n\nThe Muslim scholar said that since Islam was the second-largest religion in France, and the number one religion in Europe, people in the West are insecure and think it must be attacked, They do not want Islam to advance in those places, opined Al-Yousuf.\n\n“I would like to say that in light of all these actions, we must take a look at those who incite and distort and those who attack our Prophet Muhammad, in a country that claims to be secular and democratic, a country that claims to respect human rights, religions, opinions, and ideas. I do not know what kind of respect this is with this cursing, insulting, and attacking of Islamic symbols. This is the problem. Before we talk about this act (the murder of Samuel Paty), its judgement according to the sharia and our opinion about it… We must firmly focus on all the hostile and disgraceful actions that have been directed against Muslims for many years, actions supported by the government and extremists in France and elsewhere that were meant to distort Islam’s image in the West,” he furthered.\n\n‘Decapitation is the punishment of blasphemers’, Islamists in Pakistan after the Charlie Hebdo incident\nThis reaction from the fundamentalist, however, does not come as a surprise. The reprinting of the cartoons on Mohammad by Charlie Hebdo had also attracted similar reactions from Islamists worldwide. Last month, Pakistan witnessed protests by tens of thousands of Muslims, soon after Charlie Hebdo decided to reprint cartoons mocking Prophet Mohammad, which prompted Islamic terrorists to launch a terror attack against them in 2015. “Death to France” was chanted and the protesters called for a boycott of French products. Protestors had put out posters which read: “Decapitation is the punishment of blasphemers.”\n\nIndian Islamists had marched demanding decapitation of Kamlesh Tiwari\nBack in 2015, lakhs of Islamists in India, openly supported by Islamist organisations, religious leaders and politicians, had marched on the streets demanding the beheading of Kamlesh Tiwari, a former Hindu Maha Sabha leader who had commented on the sexuality of Mohammad. Tiwari was charged under the NSA by the then state government in UP and jailed for several months. In 2019, some Islamists had entered into his office and stabbed, shot him to death, fulfilling the long-standing demand by Islamists that anyone who ‘insults’ their prophet should be beheaded.\"\"\",'title': '‘Not a serious crime’: Islamic scholar defends Muslim man who beheaded the French teacher, says it is not something he should be punished for', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/10/not-a-serious-crime-islamic-scholar-defends-muslim-man-who-beheaded-the-french-teacher/', 'nationalist': 1}\nwilson_new_row12 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff','content': \"\"\"Relentless in its anti-Hindu and anti-India propaganda, terror organization ISIS has released new literature in the latest edition of its digital magazine, instigating Jihadists associated with the organisation to unleash terror in the country to “avenge Babri”.

While a Tanishq showroom in Gujarat has condemned the ad and apologised to the Hindu community for it, liberals are falling over backwards in justifying it. Perhaps the most clownish ‘hot take’ came from senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor who decided to pounce upon the occasion to peddle his personal delusions.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, we would ignore such comments as the mad ramblings of a con-artist who has long passed his sell-by date but since the opinion has been voiced by an individuals who ‘larps’ as an intellectual, it deserves a response.\n\nShashi Tharoor remarked on Tuesday, “If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them (‘Hindutva bigots’) so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” This is a preposterous claim. A country that lost huge portions of its territory to Islamic terrorism only seventy-three years ago cannot be the longest surviving symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ by default.\n\nSo Hindutva bigots have called for a boycott of ⁦@TanishqJewelry⁩ for highlighting Hindu-Muslim unity through this beautiful ad. If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India? pic.twitter.com/cV0LpWzjda\n\n— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) October 13, 2020\nEven after an event as cataclysmic and traumatic as the partition of 1947, if certain individuals wish to propagate India as a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, then they are deluding themselves. It is also evident in everyday discourse that India is not the symbol Shashi Tharoor and members of his party wish it to be.\n\nThe events since 2019 have cemented these facts and have left no room for doubt. The response to the abrogation of Article 370, the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Ram Mandir verdict highlighted the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two communities in excruciating detail.\n\nWhile ‘secular’ intellectuals and politicians prefer to sing paeans to ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, it is an undeniable fact that the only Muslim majority state in the country refused to join the Indian mainstream and clung on to Article 370 that essentially provided for an Islamic state within Indian territory. When the article was abrogated, the Congress party and Muslim-oriented parties opposed it tooth and nail.\n\nWith regards to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Indian Muslims wanted the descendants of those who created Pakistan to have the same privileges as the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist populations of the Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan towards whom India has a sacred commitment. The Act witnessed great protests and eventually culminated with communal riots in Delhi.\n\nThe same could be observed in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi. Much violence and bloodshed could have been avoided if the Muslim community had chosen to respect the special attachment that Hindus have towards the birthplace of Rama. But they refused to, they fought until the very end for a Masjid built by an Islamic tyrant after demolishing a Hindu Temple.\n\nThus, we see that the much exalted ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ that charlatans such as Shashi Tharoor evaporates into thin air on every major contentious issue. ‘Evaporates into thin air’ is perhaps the wrong phrase to use here since such a unity never existed in the first place. And these are only three of the most contentious issues in recent times.\n\nThere are other long-standing issues such as cow smuggling and consumption of beef where there is no consensus between the two communities. Things escalated to such a degree that members of Youth Congress slaughtered a calf in broad daylight in Kerala and consumed its meat. That the leader of such a party claims that India is a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ is indeed a disgrace.\n\nHaving said that, it is true that India is a symbol of a greater ideal. There is an idea at the core of the Republic of India, unfortunately enough, it is an idea that is reviled by men and women of a secular bent. However, it cannot be denied that India is the manifestation of the Hindu Civilization in the Age of Modernity and it is the custodian of the great civilization. It is India’s sacred duty to serve and protect our Hindu Civilization.\n\nThus, India is not a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ but evidence of the superiority of Hinduism itself. India is the only country that is home to a heterogenous polytheistic culture. For Indians, the multiplicity of the Divine is not a theoretical proposition but a lived reality. There is no other country in the world where its citizenry worships a multitude of Gods and Goddesses, with their own unique strands of traditions and ritualistic obeisance, with equal fervour.\n\nMaa Durga, Shri Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Maheshwara, Swami Ayyappa, Ganapati, Kartikeya, Lakshmi, Saraswati, there is a plethora of Gods in the Hindu pantheon and we worship the many. A wise man once remarked that polytheism is the highest expression of human consciousness and it is only in India that it finds its true expression in the 21st century. India is the cradle of civilization that has shaped and continues to shape the destinies of multiple nations. And it is so because of Hinduism and Hinduism alone.\n\nThus, secular politicians may want us to bend over backwards to accommodate their perverse fantasies but their misguided notions shall find place in our country no more. Hinduism is India’s destiny and it is Hinduism that defines India at the international order. There is no need for us to be apologetic about India’s Hindu identity; we are living in an age of Hindu assertiveness after all. Shashi Tharoor may be uncomfortable with the idea but it is one that he will have to live with.\n\nFor it is the invisible threads of Dharma that holds our country together. Peoples from different cultural, linguistic, regional backgrounds with their own unique traditions and culture lend their allegiance to India not because of fancy ideals enshrined in our Constitution. They do so because such diverse peoples are held together by the strands of Hinduism that is not always visible but always felt nonetheless.\n\nOnly Hinduism could ever hope to hold such a diverse country together. And there in lies its inherent superiority. Thus, India’s destiny and Hinduism’s are intertwined inseparably and it is one that will last till eternity.

According to it, The former JNU student, accused of engineering Jamia Riots in December last year, ‘desperately’ wanted to turn the Anti-CAA ‘protests’ into a pan-India movement.\n\n“The accused was very desperate to take the protests that level where the leaders of the protestors take the control of the mob in their own hand,” the charge sheet revealed. Sharjeel Imam was in close contact with a member of the radical Islamist outfit, Popular Front of India (PFI) who asked him to take part in the Anti-CAA protests as a part of the organisation. As a part of his modus operandi, he had visited Anti-Caa protest sites in Khureji and Seelampur which witnessed widespread violence.\n\nSharjeel Imam distributed pamphlets and mobilised mobs\nThe Whatsapp chats of Sharjeel Imam has also exposed how he weaponised ‘misinformation’ in north-East Delhi to further his agenda with the help of local Islamic clerics. Imam mobilised the Muslim community and laid the foundation for a ‘disruptive Chakka Jam’ in Delhi and other parts of India.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet filed by the Delhi Police,  Sharjeel Imam had visited several mosques and distributed pamphlets in the Nizamuddin area of Delhi and other places with the help of one Mohammed Kasif. His objective was to provoke Muslims to engage in violence, under the pretext of Anti-CAA protests.\n\nSharjeel Imam booked under UAPA\nThe new charge sheet against Sharjeel Imam was filed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 124A (Sedition), 153(A) (Promoting enmity between different groups), 153 (B) (prejudicial assertions), 505 (rumour mongering) and Section 13 of UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act). On August 25, he was arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell in another case related to the Delhi riots. Reportedly, Imam was brought back to Delhi from Islam on a productional warrant and then remanded in police custody for 4 days.\n\nThe Conspirator behind Jamia riots\nEarlier, Islamist Asif Iqbal Tanha admitted to orchestrating a march of 2500-3000 people from the Gate no.7 of Jamia Millia Islamia on December 12. He revealed that Sharjeel Imam gave a provocative speech to encourage ‘protestors’ to execute a ‘chakka jam’ on December 13. Asif confessed to organising a ‘Gandhi peace march’ on December 15 from the Jamia metro station to the Parliament via Zakir Nagar and Batla House. He stated that the purpose of naming it after Mahatma Gandhi was to lure more people into joining the march.\"\"\",'title': 'Radical Islamist Sharjeel Imam wanted to turn Anti-CAA protests into a pan-India movement: Reports', 'url': 'https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/sharjeel-imam-delhi-police-charge-sheet-spread-anti-caa-protests-india/', 'nationalist': 1}\nwilson_new_row15 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff','content': \"\"\"Radical Islamist and Newslaundry journalist Sharjeel Usmani has been granted bail by a local court in Aligarh on Friday.\n\nAccording to the reports, the AMU student Sharjeel Usmani, who was arrested on charges of instigating riots during the anti-CAA protests, was granted bail by a sessions court in Aligarh. He was arrested by the UP police on July 29 for his alleged role in violent anti-CAA protests.\n\nSpecial Judge Narendra Singh, granting bail to Usmani, noted that the AMU student had a very good academic record and was not arrested from the scene of the crime. According to the judge, no incriminating evidence was found on him at the time of the arrest.\n\nThe court not only took his academic credentials into cognizance but also noted that the accused had also written articles while granting bail in two cases.\n\n“Keeping the accused further in jail will definitely serve no purpose at all.

The ideological compatriot of Sharjeel Imam, Sharjeel Usmani, has announced his intentions of using Muslims as the fifth columns in the country to undermine Indian interests.\n\nShortly after Imam’s arrest, Usmani waged a propaganda war on the country to smear its India’s image abroad. Sharjeel Usmani announced that he, along with two of his friends, will put English subtitles on the videos of ‘hate crimes’ against Muslims in India to circulate them among social media influencers for wider global reach.\n\nAfter the incendiary speeches of Sharjeel Imam had gone viral on social media, Sharjeel Usmani had rushed in to defend him. He had urged Muslims to not disassociate themselves from the JNU scholar and declared that he was ‘in this together’ with the radical Islamist.

Their economic viability is being seriously threatened: One leg of the plan is to intimidate advertisers, another leg of the plan is to destroy the system of TRPs altogether. In opposition ruled states, the secular ecosystem is able to follow up these tactics with extensive “direct action” on the ground. There is of course Bengal where high profile dissenters are shot in full public view. In Bengal, workers from opposition parties are murdered and hung from trees and poles so that everyone can see. On their shirts, the death squads write clearly that this the punishment for joining BJP. In another state, storm troopers showed up in jackboots at the house of a Navy veteran who dared forward a cartoon. An A-list Bollywood celebrity said a word against a secular government. The next day, they showed up at her house with bulldozers. Again, this is when the BJP is in power at Centre. Imagine what would happen if the Congress were to somehow come back to power. Whether or not you would like that is another matter. The question is this: if Congress comes back to power tomorrow, do you think you as a citizen will be able to utter a word against them? You might be wondering. So what if Congress comes back? They have ruled India so many times. With one terrifying exception in 1975, democracy has mostly been fine. True. But this time it is different. Let me explain why. Because technology. A decade ago, when technology took off as a medium of political communication in India, a senior establishment leader had remarked that the internet is an ungovernable sphere. Back then, the opportunities seemed limitless. Anyone could go online and say anything. And it could spread anywhere, depending on how much attention it got. That’s changed. From this utopian vision of a free and ungovernable realm of ideas, technology has become a machine that can be used for totalitarian thought control. We are putting everything online: our shopping habits, our tastes in food, drink and travel. And of course our personal and professional communication. And the pandemic turbocharged this phenomenon. For the first time in history, common people are talking to each other in writing. I remember that a hardcore leftist journo had observed this astutely in 2012. Each one of us now has a digital footprint, with all our thoughts on record. The personal has become public. Take the case of that Navy veteran who was beaten up because he forwarded a cartoon. Ten years ago, the old man would have made the joke orally to a small circle of friends. And nobody would have known. But now, he posted it on social media. The storm troopers got to know. Never in history, not even under the worst of dictators, has such targeted micro level action against dissenters been possible. Now, it is. Today, it is possible for a government to target literally every dissenter. Do you think Congress is not going to use it if they get a chance at power? What does ‘targeting’ mean? Jackboots at the door? Not necessarily. Even though the dissenting Navy veteran was identified by the power of technology, he was targeted in a rather primitive way. This could never work on a large scale. In India, there would be literally hundreds of millions of dissenters. How many doors would the storm troopers break down? Again, technology has a much more chilling solution to tackle this problem on a large scale. There’s no need to beat up dissenters individually. With one line of code, the dissenters can all be placed on a blacklist, accused of “spreading hate.” The next day, they will all lose their jobs and everyone from banks to mobile phone operators will refuse to do business with them. How would they survive without a job, without a bank account or even a phone? Think it can’t happen? It’s already happening. The Chinese call it the ‘social credit system.’ If you fall out of favour with the government, your life gets progressively harder, to the point that you would not be able to buy so much as a bus ticket. You can then agree to “reform” by showing your loyalty to the government and slowly raise your “social credit score.” You think the secular overlords will reject this technology if they get a chance? Am I being too dark and too pessimistic? After all, China is China. We’re a democracy. They can’t do this here. Fine, how about the United States? They are the oldest democracy in the world. Last week, the New York Post published an explosive story about business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of US Presidential candidate Joe Biden. Those who tried to tweet the story or plug it on Facebook found that it was impossible to do so. Even via direct messages… They did this in the US. Still think they can’t do this here? Okay, this time they got caught. But they still fulfilled their main objective, slowing down the story. Next time, their algorithms will tackle this even better. Next time, they won’t get caught. Around 2010, the secular ecosystem was caught flat footed and complacent by the rise of social media. They mocked the medium because they didn’t understand it. A lot of real people began speaking for the first time. This collective voice played a huge role in destroying the UPA government. Stung by the defeat, they’ve learned well. They turned their full propaganda machinery towards owning the digital space. They put up “news” website after website in quick succession, with massive funding, top notch production and media graduates swarming into the new space. They fanned out across YouTube and Instagram, building a massive coalition of influencers. On the right, the resistance was patchy at best. Most were real people, with real day jobs, families and bills to pay. It is commendable that they held the fort for so long. But anyone who sees the internet space today will know that the resistance is rupturing badly. There was only so much that hobbyists could have done to stop a well oiled machine. All other pieces are in place. All that remains is for their friends to get back in power. The moment they get that back, they will take ownership of most of their loudspeakers in the old media of TV and newspapers. Most of it still works for them anyway. The handful of right leaning media will be snuffed out quickly by government action, threatening advertisers or banning them under the excuse of “stopping hate.” This time, they will have a third and most potent weapon: technology and dominance in the digital space. The legions of influencers and the brands are in place already. You will be blasted with propaganda at all levels. With the personal sphere becoming public, your reaction to each event will be under their scrutiny. The smallest show of dissent will be punished, not by jackboots at your door, but by a faceless algorithm that will destroy your life in a millisecond. The old dictators were prone to creating martyrs. This time, there wont be martyrs because nobody will come to know.

While a Tanishq showroom in Gujarat has condemned the ad and apologised to the Hindu community for it, liberals are falling over backwards in justifying it. Perhaps the most clownish ‘hot take’ came from senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor who decided to pounce upon the occasion to peddle his personal delusions. Under normal circumstances, we would ignore such comments as the mad ramblings of a con-artist who has long passed his sell-by date but since the opinion has been voiced by an individuals who ‘larps’ as an intellectual, it deserves a response. Shashi Tharoor remarked on Tuesday, “If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them (‘Hindutva bigots’) so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” This is a preposterous claim. A country that lost huge portions of its territory to Islamic terrorism only seventy-three years ago cannot be the longest surviving symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ by default. Even after an event as cataclysmic and traumatic as the partition of 1947, if certain individuals wish to propagate India as a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, then they are deluding themselves. It is also evident in everyday discourse that India is not the symbol Shashi Tharoor and members of his party wish it to be. The events since 2019 have cemented these facts and have left no room for doubt. The response to the abrogation of Article 370, the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Ram Mandir verdict highlighted the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two communities in excruciating detail. While ‘secular’ intellectuals and politicians prefer to sing paeans to ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, it is an undeniable fact that the only Muslim majority state in the country refused to join the Indian mainstream and clung on to Article 370 that essentially provided for an Islamic state within Indian territory. When the article was abrogated, the Congress party and Muslim-oriented parties opposed it tooth and nail. With regards to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Indian Muslims wanted the descendants of those who created Pakistan to have the same privileges as the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist populations of the Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan towards whom India has a sacred commitment. The Act witnessed great protests and eventually culminated with communal riots in Delhi. The same could be observed in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi. Much violence and bloodshed could have been avoided if the Muslim community had chosen to respect the special attachment that Hindus have towards the birthplace of Rama. But they refused to, they fought until the very end for a Masjid built by an Islamic tyrant after demolishing a Hindu Temple. Thus, we see that the much exalted ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ that charlatans such as Shashi Tharoor evaporates into thin air on every major contentious issue. ‘Evaporates into thin air’ is perhaps the wrong phrase to use here since such a unity never existed in the first place. And these are only three of the most contentious issues in recent times. There are other long-standing issues such as cow smuggling and consumption of beef where there is no consensus between the two communities. Things escalated to such a degree that members of Youth Congress slaughtered a calf in broad daylight in Kerala and consumed its meat. That the leader of such a party claims that India is a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ is indeed a disgrace. Having said that, it is true that India is a symbol of a greater ideal. There is an idea at the core of the Republic of India, unfortunately enough, it is an idea that is reviled by men and women of a secular bent. However, it cannot be denied that India is the manifestation of the Hindu Civilization in the Age of Modernity and it is the custodian of the great civilization. It is India’s sacred duty to serve and protect our Hindu Civilization. Thus, India is not a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ but evidence of the superiority of Hinduism itself. India is the only country that is home to a heterogenous polytheistic culture. For Indians, the multiplicity of the Divine is not a theoretical proposition but a lived reality. There is no other country in the world where its citizenry worships a multitude of Gods and Goddesses, with their own unique strands of traditions and ritualistic obeisance, with equal fervour. Maa Durga, Shri Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Maheshwara, Swami Ayyappa, Ganapati, Kartikeya, Lakshmi, Saraswati, there is a plethora of Gods in the Hindu pantheon and we worship the many. A wise man once remarked that polytheism is the highest expression of human consciousness and it is only in India that it finds its true expression in the 21st century. India is the cradle of civilization that has shaped and continues to shape the destinies of multiple nations. And it is so because of Hinduism and Hinduism alone. Thus, secular politicians may want us to bend over backwards to accommodate their perverse fantasies but their misguided notions shall find place in our country no more. Hinduism is India’s destiny and it is Hinduism that defines India at the international order. There is no need for us to be apologetic about India’s Hindu identity; we are living in an age of Hindu assertiveness after all. Shashi Tharoor may be uncomfortable with the idea but it is one that he will have to live with. For it is the invisible threads of Dharma that holds our country together. Peoples from different cultural, linguistic, regional backgrounds with their own unique traditions and culture lend their allegiance to India not because of fancy ideals enshrined in our Constitution. They do so because such diverse peoples are held together by the strands of Hinduism that is not always visible but always felt nonetheless. Only Hinduism could ever hope to hold such a diverse country together. And there in lies its inherent superiority. Thus, India’s destiny and Hinduism’s are intertwined inseparably and it is one that will last till eternity.

PM Modi said that the nation can see how they are opposing the reforms without any reason. He said that those opposing the Farm Bills do not want the farmers to sell their produce in open market instead they want the middleman to earn profit. He added that they are opposing the freedom of farmers. “They set fire to the equipments farmers worship,” PM Modi added calling out Punjab Youth Congress’ stunt of setting the tractor on fire in Delhi. He added that the previous Congress governments did not implementing the MSP and broke their promise. He said that the current government acted on the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission and implemented the MSP. Accusing the opposition of misleading the farmers, PM Modi said that the people lamenting the farm reforms because the source of their black money will be finished after the reforms. PM Modi took a dig at the Congress party for ignoring the demands of the Air Force for Rafale aircraft. He said that the previous Congress governments did nothing for empowering our security forces. He remined how the opposition had shown their “intention” before the country by questioning the surgical strike carried out by our security forces on Pakistan. He also recalled how the opposition had opposed Yoga in India while the world was celebrating the International Yoga Day and that how they had also opposed the Statue of Unity dedicated to national leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He said that no opposition has visited the Statue of Unity. PM Modi said that the people opposing reforms for the sake of doing it are losing relevance day by day. He recalled how they had opposed the Bhum Pujan of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya after opposing it in the Supreme Court. Attacking the Congress party, PM Modi said there are several smaller political parties in the country that never formed a government or been a part of the government and yet they never worked against the interests of the country but some parties that have been opposition for a very short time are behaving like this. Prime Minister Narendra Modi today spoke via video conference at the occasion of inauguration of development projects in Uttarakhand. PM Modi inaugurated six mega projects under the Namami Gange Mission in Uttarakhand. The projects include the construction of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with 68 Million litres per day (MLD) capacity, construction of an 18 MLD STP at Sarai in Haridwar, upgradation of the existing 27 MLD STP at Jagjeertpur, Haridwar and the inauguration of 26 MLD STP at Lakkadghat in Hrishikesh along with a 5 MLD STP at Chorpani and two STPs having capacities of 1 MLD and 0.01 MLD at Badrinath. The PM also unveiled that logo fo Jal Jeevan Mission and Margadarshika for village panchayats and Paani Samitis under the Namami Gange Mission. He also inaugurated the first museum on Ganga called Ganga Avalokan at Chandi Ghat, Hariswar which will showcase the culture, biodiversity and rejuvenation activities done in the river.

Furthermore, they demand ‘proportional representation’ and reservations for Muslims in government jobs. The Zakat Foundation, aside from its extremely problematic views, has been relentless in making their demands heard regardless of which government is in power. When the Congress was in power in 2013, the Zakat Foundation had met the then PM, Manmohan Singh and demanded that seats where Muslims form a large population be ‘delimited’ and Rahul Gandhi had promised to add it in their 2014 manifesto. Delimitation is the act of redrawing boundaries of Lok Sabha and Assembly seats to represent changes in population. While the delimitation is in process, the number of seats allocated to a state also change depending on the population and demography. The delimitation committee’s decision is considered sacrosanct and cannot be challenged in any court of law. Initially, when the Delimitation Committee was formed, the idea was to ensure equal representation of every segment of the population and also to ensure that no political party gets an advantage in the electoral process by ensuring that the geographical area was divided fairly. During the negotiations for Ram Janmabhoomi, the Zakat Foundation was a part of the process. They had posed 8 extremely problematic demands to concede the Ram Janmabhoomi. Eventually, the negotiations failed, however, it is important to understand the mindset of the Zakat Foundation through the demands they made. One of the demands made by the Zakat Foundation was “The constituencies of Lok Sabha and state assemblies where the Muslim population is very high while the Scheduled Caste percentage is not among the highest should be de-reserved. Instead, reserve those constituencies where SC percentage is among the highest, as recommended by the Sachar Committee.” This demand stems from the ZFI’s intention of increasing Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha. The ZFI is of the opinion that the number of Muslim MPs in the Lower House of the Parliament is less than the number it is supposed to be in terms of their proportion to the Indian population. In short, they wish to have Muslim MPs proportional to their share of their population, a demand that was summarily rejected by the Constituent Assembly of India.Furthermore, the Sachar Committee that is spoken of here is a panel that was set up by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to look into alleged Muslim deprivation and Syed Zafar Mahmood actually served in the Committee. Thus, he is promoting the recommendations of a committee he was himself a member of.The demand for delimitation was not limited to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the negotiations thereof. This demand has been one which has been pushed by the Zakat Foundation since a long time. In fact, it is one of the tropes they use to tell IAS aspirants that they need to get into the bureaucracy so that they can make such demands a reality. In a presentation made by the Zakat Foundation President in the year 2016, he reveals that he had met erstwhile Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and demanded that before the 2014 elections, the LS seats should be delimited to ensure that more Muslims get elected to the Parliament. In 2013, when the 7th Pay Commission was announced, the Zakat Foundation made a representation to the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and asked if they Pay Commission can be implemented, then why not the Delimitation demands. Interestingly, Dr Manmohan Singh was reportedly “reminded” of this pending issue while Zakat Foundation had met him in the aftermath of the Muzaffarpur riots. According to a Times of India report, Zakat Foundation chief said, “The PM told us that in view of the upcoming election how can a delimitation commission be appointed now?”. It is to be noted that Mahmood was also the PM-appointed officer on special duty to the Sachar Committee. In 2013, Rahul Gandhi had held a detailed discussion with Muslim leaders from across the country. In this discussion, Rahul Gandhi had promised that the issue of delimitation of Muslim seats will be recommended to the committee and that he will also ensure that Congress adds this demand in their 2014 manifesto. The twocircles article says: The matter was raised during the meeting with Rahul Gandhi by Dr Syed. Zafar Mahmood, President, Zakat Foundation of India who presented 20 Works to be done for Muslims. These also include the establishment of fast track courts to deal with terror allegations, compensation of Rs 50 lakh to each person who is judicially acquitted of terror allegations, deletion of para 3 from the 1950 definition of scheduled caste, withdrawal of limited competitive examination scheme for recruitment of additional 1400 IPS officers, restoration of minority character of AMU. Essentially, if the Congress had come back to power in the year 2014 or 2019, delimitation of seats was a near certainly. This would mean far more Muslim representatives in the parliament and more importantly, the reservations being taken away from the SC/ST community. What is interesting to observe is that this demand is not very different from the demand of separate electorates made by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, a demand that was rejected by Jawaharlal Nehru. The demand for a separate electoral essentially meant that Jinnah believed Hindus and Muslims cannot co-exist and that Hindus were incapable of representing the interests of Muslims. This was a direct consequence of the two-nation theory that was espoused by Jinnah. That the Zakat Foundation is pursuing the demand for delimitation specifically of Muslim seats, while not exactly like demanding a separate electorate also points towards the same mindset.\", \n'nationalist': 1,'title': \"If Congress had come back to power, delimitation of seats with Muslim population would have been a reality, thanks to Zakat Foundation: Details\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2020/09/zakat-foundation-delimitation-muslim-seats-congress-rahul-gandhi-agreed-manifesto-2014/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website': np.nan}\n\nnewrow6 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff', 'content': \"The value of the donations given by Prime Minister Modi for various public purposes and the amount received after auctioning the gifts received by him has exceeded more than 103 crore rupees.

Or maybe the Congress would have won so few seats that the PM post would go to a third party with a 2-3% share of the national vote. Like I said, it is all about saving democracy. Narendra Modi would have become Leader of the Opposition. (Who would be health minister? It is impossible to say exactly, but my guess would be Lalu Yadav’s daughter “Dr.” Misa Bharti. Did you know that she topped the MBBS exam at Patna Medical College hospital when her parents were ruling Bihar? For some reason, this distinguished medical scholar does not appear to be practicing medicine.) Anyway. In that scenario, how do you think the media would be covering the pandemic right now? Let’s see: right now, you can go to mainstream or social media and find any number of taunts, jokes, jibes at PM Modi for the rising number of coronavirus cases in India. Would it have been the same if someone else had won the 2019 election? Perhaps. But consider this: along with what you see, take into account what you don’t see. Maharashtra is India’s number one state in terms of coronavirus case load. It has been so practically since the beginning. Other states have seen ups and downs, but in case of Maharashtra, there has no been no lull at any point. Just a constant surge. No let up in test positive rate either. It was over 22% yesterday. I challenge you to go to mainstream media right now and find one line of criticism against the way the Govt of Maharashtra has conducted itself in this pandemic. In fact, Shiv Sena MPs right now on Twitter are taking potshots at PM Modi over India reporting the highest number of virus cases in the world. No sense of irony about which state is reporting the highest number of virus cases in India. That is how comprehensive the clean chit given by the media to the MVA government. Imagine if such a formation was ruling India. Ok, but this is a pandemic. How can you blame individual state governments? But isn’t healthcare a state subject? It certainly is. And the media certainly brought this up, just in a different tone. Congratulations to the Maharashtra Chief Minister for making the war with Covid-19 look easy. You might notice that all seven Chief Ministers mentioned in the article just happen to be non-BJP Chief Ministers. Some people were so excited about the suddenly high profile role of state governments that they thought 2020 would be the year of the chief minister! Star Chief Ministers… Again, all of them non-BJP. Was there any state government which was vilified? Of course. At the time Rajdeep Sardesai wrote this article, Gujarat was number two in coronavirus cases in the country. Who was number 1? Never mind. So it’s not like they didn’t see the role of state governments. They just cheered non-BJP state governments early on. And savagely criticized the BJP ruled states. But as the pandemic progressed and it became clear the virus wasn’t going away any time soon, the media just fell silent. And pointed all its fingers at the Center. What began as the year for giving credit to Chief Ministers became a year where all the blame was put on the Prime Minister. For Uddhavsaheb, who went on to earn the tag of “best CM,” this turnaround in media perception must be particularly pleasing. Not long ago, the only party that was vilified in media more than BJP was perhaps the Shiv Sena. But he only had to sign the magical dotted line that made him an ally of 10 Janpath. And with that, all accusations against his politics went away. All questions about his governance style and performance disappeared into the void of Indian secularism. Our media is very forgiving. Then, the lockdown began and the migrant worker crisis gradually entered public consciousness. It started with thousands of workers in Delhi gathering on the UP border, unable to make a living in the capital any more. Interestingly, the media explained to us that the onus was not on the state they were fleeing from, i.e., Delhi. The onus was on the state they were fleeing to, i.e., Uttar Pradesh. This narrative was soon repeated nationwide. Migrant workers hungry in Maharashtra: why won’t Uttar Pradesh or Bihar take care of them? Then, the Central government began running special trains to take migrant workers back home. That’s when they blamed the Central government for running “Corona express” as part of a conspiracy to spread the virus in West Bengal. Oh, I’m sorry. Mamata didi never said “Corona express,” she said that the “people” called it that. Shame on “people.” Things have changed a lot since the early days of April and May. From number 2 at one point, Gujarat has steadily worked its way out of the swamp. As of now, it is not even in the top 10. The test positive rate has also dipped well below 2%. Since the beginning, Gujarat has seen 99,000 cases total, of which some 16000 remain active. For comparison, Kerala has seen 78,000 cases, of which some 22,000 remain active. Did you know that Gujarat has twice the population of Kerala? But Kerala is reducing testing aggressively. The other day, it only tested 11,000 people, finding about 1100 positive cases. A rate of 10% compared to under 2% for Gujarat. At this rate, if Kerala reduces testing to zero, it will certainly stay far behind Gujarat in number of total cases.Did I say Kerala? Did I say zero? It reminded me of this. That Hindu article dated May 5, 2020 is actually a little late in giving credit to Kerala for winning the war on Covid. This article in Quartz congratulated the Kerala government for winning the war on Feb 14 itself. Since then, Kerala’s legendary Health Minister Shailaja “Teacher” has been giving regular coaching classes to the world on how to stop the pandemic. In the process, she has collected so many awards and accolades that it would take too long to list them all. It is like being asked to make a list of all the great innings of Sachin Tendulkar. But as cases in Kerala kept surging, the media adulation slowly turned into silence. There was no follow up, no questioning about what Kerala did wrong. It seems Ravish Kumar gave up on his dream of a debate between Gujarat model and Kerala model. Earlier, he had asked if Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan should be made “captain” of India’s covid response. But for the most part, silence from the media on Kerala. Silence on Maharashtra and “best CM.” When things go wrong, the really fearless media chooses silence over dissent against ‘secular’ governments. In fact, silence has played a key role in India’s media history. Just before the 2014 election, the Congress ruled India for 10 straight years. This was the latest chunk in its near uninterrupted ~60 year rule out of 67 years of independence at that point. Can you imagine one of our fearless journalists sitting across from Sonia Gandhi and asking her these two questions: (1) Why is it that India’s per capita GDP crossed Pakistan’s per capita GDP only in 2007? Why did it take 60 years for the average Indian to catch up to the average Pakistani? (2) Why is it that less than 40% of Indian households in 2014 had access to toilets? Why were 3 crore households without electricity connections? Why did 15 crore households have no tap water? If Sonia Gandhi wouldn’t grant them an audience, they could have just put their questions out there. In their editorial columns, on their Facebook pages or Twitter timelines. They didn’t. They chose silence. Silence was the media’s favorite weapon for 67 years. They were silent during Lalu Yadav’s jungle raj in Bihar. They were silent when Mulayam Singh Yadav’s government allowed cheating in board exams in Uttar Pradesh. They were silent when Jyoti Basu’s government drove out all industry from Bengal and carried out massacres of political dissidents. They have questions only for Modi. So deafening is this silence that Rahul Gandhi can face the camera and boldly deny all responsibility for the actions of the Govt of Maharashtra, even though he has 10 Cabinet ministers in it.If Congress had won the 2019 election, suffice to say that we would have complete media silence on the pandemic right now. For 67 years, they could not ask why Indians don’t have toilets, gas, electricity or running water. They have broken their silence now. They are asking why India is unable to stop the pandemic. After all, France did it. The South Koreans did it a long time ago. The USA is slowly getting closer to doing it. How can India be behind countries like France, South Korea and the USA?\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"How would media have covered the pandemic if Congress had won the 2019 election?\" , 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2020/09/media-covered-coronavirus-pandemic-if-congress-had-won-elections/\" , 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website': np.nan}\n\nnewrow8 = {'author': 'OpIndia Staff','content': \"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi gave a nudge to Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and other Muslim leaders in Congress and asked them for long will they continue to be slaves of the party’s ‘janeudhari‘ leadership.

In 2019, Sonia Gandhi was made the interim president by the Congress Working Committee after Rahul Gandhi quit the post after the general elections fiasco. On Monday she would complete one year in office. The party claims that that the process to elect new chief has been postponed due to coronavirus pandemic and assured of complying with the provisions of the EC as soon as normalcy was restored. The Election Commission often stays away from interfering into the party’s internal issues. However, if it chooses, it can initiate action against any political party for failing to comply with the rules and regulations. The EC could also freeze the election symbol under the Symbol Order, which is an executive decision. The political parties are governed by Section 29 (A), sub-clause (V) of the Representation of People’s Act, introduced in 1989 to bring them under its ambit. Each political party, including the Congress, has to re-register itself, and agree to show its allegiance to the Constitution of India and participate in the periodic elections. Even though there are no rules for ensuring mandatory compliance, the Election Commission can time-and-again take a call on the matter, if and when, it deems appropriate. The EC may now examine if the INC Constitution has a specific provision regarding the election of a new president within a specified period after the incumbent vacates the post. The commission can order the party to hold the internal elections within this stipulated time frame. The worry for the grand-old-party is that the crisis within the party is likely to further deepen. The interim President Sonia Gandhi was recently admitted to the Ganga Ram hospital over some health complications. If she decides to go abroad for her annual medical check-up, the party may need to elect someone else in her place especially if Rahul Gandhi is reluctant to take charge. The president of the party can only be elected only by the All India Congress Committee. Meanwhile, the party cadres, including senior leaders of the party are demanding that the AICC should be convened at the earliest to fill up the key organisational position. They have also been asking for the reinstatement of the Congress Parliamentary Board, with a duly elected Working Committee, to provide representation to leaders who have a mass connect. Since multiple power centres have emerged, Congress party is currently highly vulnerable and susceptible to the machinations of the BJP, the Congress leaders believe since the current state of the organisation is both leaderless and directionless. While the Madhya Pradesh government collapsed earlier this year, the Rajasthan government is facing an existential crisis as well. There are also reports which indicate that the Chhattisgarh government may go the Madhya Pradesh way. The coalition government in Jharkhand also seems to have a bleak future. The BJP has been closely following the unfolding drama within the Congress and is waiting on the sidelines to take advantage of the unfurling situation. One of the outstanding issues with the Congress party is the indecisiveness of Rahul Gandhi. On one hand he has reportedly made it clear that he does not want to return as the party chief, on the other hand, he prefers to remain silent when his close associates raise demands for his reinstatement. Moreover, Sonia Gandhi’s health situation does not permit her to be pro-active as the president. Hence, the party may have to relieve her from many responsibilities in the larger interest of the organisation at the earliest. However, one of the major concerns has been that her her prolonged tenure has centralised the decision-making process. Most of the decisions of the party are made by her without any process of consultation. Prior to this, the Congress leaders apparently took decisions in consultation with the Congress Parliamentary Board. At one point, the CPB was an all-powerful body and each Rajya Sabha seat or that of the Legislative Council required its clearance. Contrastingly, the Congress party has done away with the CPB. Meanwhile the BJP has adopted the same with the Parliamentary Board of the party collectively arriving at important decisions with consultations. Ever since Sonia Gandhi took over the reins of the party, she has been the supreme leader. Apart from being the party president, she was also the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, the chairperson of the UPA and the head of the Election Committee and the Working Committee. She was also the convener of the National Advisory Council, during the UPA regime, which made her the de-facto Prime Minister. Some believe that such a concentration of authority and power has led to the decline of the party. In addition, her proclivity of favouring Dalits-Muslims over others fragmented and weakened the party. The senior leaders of the party are now in a view that, once Rahul Gandhi’s decision is known, the party should go ahead with the organisational elections and elect a non-Gandhi. In the interim, there could be either an arrangement of collective leadership or a leader with proven abilities and logistical skills such as Kamal Nath or Bhupinder Singh Hooda to be made the chief. The younger leaders can participate in the elections and therefore would discover their actual standing within the party. The leaders who win these election hurdles can be thus shortlisted as future leaders.\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"Congress party may face suspension or disqualification if it fails to elect a party president soon: Read details\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2020/08/congress-president-rahul-sonia-election-commission-president/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\nnewrow10 = {'author': \"Nupur J Sharma\" ,'content': \"It is said that any election is decided by the ones who show up, and by the very nature of democracy, any political system works as a revolving door. The corridors of power see many footprints where ecosystems rise and fall at the will of the people, where rulers bite the dust and from the ashes, other rulers, for better or worse, emerge. The will of the people reigns supreme – again – for the better or worse – but the will of the people reigns supreme nonetheless. In India, especially, democracy has a 24/7 job. Every election cycle ends with the beginning of the preparation for the next election cycle. After the 2019 General elections, we have had elections in several states, with many more to go before 2024 General elections. After the results are declared for every election, in a society which has now been divided on the basis of ideology, whether one agrees or not, there is one section of the population for whom democracy ‘lives’ and another, for whom democracy ‘dies’. However, to the credit of the non-Left, they have been far more gracious in accepting the people’s mandate compared to the Left. The Left often blames people, calls the majority population ‘Hindu extremists’ assuming that only Hindus voted for the BJP and that every Hindu who did, is an “extremist”. They cry, whine, abuse, blame the system, blame democracy, curse the mandate, curse the people, curse the leader, evoke Nehru and Gandhi and the Holy Pope even to express their angst. Their angst mainly revolves around the fact that the people who voted BJP refused to agree with them or fall for their propaganda. The non-Left, thankfully, simply dust themselves off and prepare for the next battle. At least traditionally, they did. Any party focussed on the Hindu cause and one that does not either control or bow to the Left ecosystem has tasted long bouts of electoral loss. Only recently, have the political bells starting tolling in favour of the BJP, that has traditionally, been aligned with the Hindu cause. With political power and streaks of unprecedented victory, the non-Left has started mirroring the Left in their response to defeat, thankfully, not completely.

On Saturday Aurangabad leader Suhas Dashrathe joined Raj Thackeray led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) along with two other leaders – Prakash Mahajan, Harshvardhan Jadhav. Suhas Dashrathe is a veteran Shiv Sena leader who has spent 38 years in the party. Prakash Mahajan is a brother of late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, while Harshvardhan Jadhav is a former MLA. The Shiv Sena leaders left the party just ahead of Municipal Corporation Election in Aurangabad, which is scheduled for April this year. Sena is heading the Corporation at present for many years. The move came after MNS tilted towards Hindutva after that space was vacated by Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. Harshvardhan Jadhav said that the cause of Hindutva taken up by Raj Thackeray appealed to him. “I will definitely work to expand the party’s base (in Aurangabad). We will definitely win the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation,” Jadhav said. Read- It is Shiv Sena’s turn now, but the anti-Modi fever has ruined many a political careers Prakash Mahajan said that Raj Thackeray is the only leader who will be able to take up the cause of Hindutva after Bal Thackeray. “Raj Thackeray will emerge as the iconic leader of Hindutva in the time to come and Hindutva needs him,” Mahajan said. In the meanwhile, MNS stepped up its attack on Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray challenging him to fulfil his commitment of deporting illegal immigrants. They put up posters outside Thackeray’s resident Matoshri, which said, “Honourable Chief Minister, if your stance is that Pakistani and Bangladeshi infiltrators must be thrown out of the country, then first clear the neighbourhoods in your Bandra backyard that are brimming with infiltrators.” On 23rd January, on Bal Thackrey’s birth anniversary, MNS chief Raj Thackrey had revealed the decision to change the flag to Shivaji Maharaj’s Raj Mudra or the royal seal was the original idea for the flag. He is certainly leaving no opportunity in his attempt to get a makeover of his party, after announcing his support for the Modi Government over CAA and the proposed NRC.

Several pro-Islamist Indian journalists took it upon themselves to defame India internationally, while others, habitually peddle lies through proxy websites and social media to tarnish the image of India after the Modi government decided to abrogate Article 370 and finally, fully integrate the new Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India. The pro-Islamist lobby has now found a new way to hit-out at PM Modi, albeit, with lies and deceit. In the parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Modi hit out at Kashmir politicians like Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti for their threats prior to the abrogation of Article 370. Prime Minister Modi in parliament first quoted Mehbooba Mufti. Read: Jammu and Kashmir: NC’s Omar Abdullah and PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti booked under Public Safety Act PM Modi quoted a tweetstorm by Mehmooba Mufti on the 5th of August, the day Article 370 was abrogated. Specifically, PM Modi referred to this tweet where Mehbooba Mufti had questioned what Kashmir got for “choosing India.” Then, PM Modi referred to Omar Abdullah and said Omar had said, “आर्टिकल 370 को हटाना ऐसा भूकंप लाएगा की कश्मीर भारत से अलग हो जायेगा (The abrogation of Article 370 would bring a massive earthquake that it will divide Kashmir from India.)”. Before we get into how the propagandists are now trying to twist PM Modi’s words, one must understand the context in which PM Modi was speaking. First, PM Modi spoke at length about the development that has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. He then spoke about how there are charges that the Abrogation of Article 370 was against the tenets of the Constitution of India. It was then that PM Modi quoted Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah to explain how it was their statements that were against the very tenets of the Constitution and the territorial integrity of India. Read: AltNews’ Pratik Sinha helps New Yorker water down Pulwama attack, cast aspersions that Balakot airstrike was fabricated To understand this better, here are parts of what Mehbooba Mufti had said after the abrogation of Article 370. “Decision of J&K leadership to reject 2 nation theory in 1947 & align with India has backfired. Unilateral decision of GOI to scrap Article 370 is illegal & unconstitutional which will make India an occupational force in J&K. GOIs intentions are clear. They want the territory of J&K by terrorising it’s people. Those elements in J&K who rejected the constitution & sought resolution under the UN have been vindicated. GOIs intention is clear & sinister. They want to change the demography of the only Muslim majority state in India, disempower Muslims to the extent where they become second class citizens in their own state. What did J&K get for acceding to India? Another partition along communal lines? Our special status isn’t a gift bestowed upon us. Its a right guaranteed by the same parliament. A contract entered into by J&K leadership & India. Today the very same contract has been violated (sic).” Further, Omar Abdullah had said that this decision will have ‘dangerous consequences’ almost threatening the Union of India. To understand what he meant by these threats, one must look at Omar Abdullah’s 2014 tweet-storm where he had elucidated exactly what these ‘consequences’ were. Essentially, both Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti had spoken about breaking India up, inciting violence and supporting terrorists and separatists of Kashmir if Article 370 was abrogated. In fact, after being put under house arrest, Omar Abdullah had also raised questions on Kashmir acceding to India and said that the accession was based on Article 370, essentially hinting that now that Article 370 has been abrogated, there is no reason for Kashmir to be a part of India. In fact, Omar Abdullah’s statement post the abrogation of Article 370 and those of Rahul Gandhi, whose party is today shielding Omar Abdullah from the statements of PM Modi were quoted by Pakistan in their anti-India dossier to UNHRC. Now that these problematic and dangerous statements were mentioned by PM Modi in the parliament itself after time had wiped them clean from public memory, the lobby had to find a way to save face, as they always do, when Islamists are exposed. The Lutyens cabal then focussed on one word that was used by the Prime Minister as a ‘matter of speech’, in order to whitewash the threats issued by the Kashmir leaders only points to a deeper malaise within the Lutyens ecosystem. Several propagandists took to Twitter to claim that PM Modi was lying and that he had, in fact, quoted a satire website Faking News and passed the word ‘Earthquake’ as an authentic quote by Omar Abdullah. The trope was started by propagandists like Swati Chaturvedi and to help the narrative reach further, self-proclaimed fact-checkers like AltNews who have been caught peddling lies often also chimed in along with Congress and other usual suspects. What the propagandists were trying to do is shield Islamist leaders from Kashmir like Omar Abdullah and latch on to one word, while hiding the truly seditious statements that Abdullah and Mufti had given after the abrogation of Article 370. The chorus would have been funny if not tragic. ‘will cause earthquakes’ is a popular figure of speech and even their favourite Rahul Gandhi had used it. PM Modi simply paraphrased it. Just that it happened to have been used on Faking News too, doesn’t mean he quoted Faking News. Basically, PM Modi used a figure of speech to paraphrase whatever was said by the Kashmir politicians. While the manner in which PM Modi paraphrased Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti did not alter the meaning of their sentiment, the same cannot be said about the cabal. In fact, paraphrasing and interpreting wrongly the meaning of PM Modi says has been the favourite strawman tactic used by the cabal for a long time with the media happily playing along, just as it is now. Going back to point from where the vilification of Prime Minister Modi started – The Gujarat riots of 2002. Times of India had reported that speaking about the riots, PM Modi had said that ‘every action has a reaction’, essentially meaning that the burning of Hindus has been answered with the riots. However, Modi had never said this. After TOI reported this blatant lie, several op-eds by media foot soldiers were written demonising Modi. Later, in 2013, before the 2014 General Elections, media had misquoted Modi yet again. They reported that Modi had compared Muslims to dogs by saying that even if a dog died, he would have felt bad. In reality, it was again only a metaphor used. Modi had essentially said that we are human beings who feel bad even if an animal dies, the Muslims and Hindus who died were human beings and he is pained by their death. The most recent was PM Modi’s “15 Lac” comment during the run-up to 2014 elections. PM Modi had said, to quantify the amount of black money stashed abroad that if we ever got all the black money back to India, there was so much, that every person could get 15 Lac out of it. That statement was twisted to report that PM Modi had promised the people of India that he would credit Rs 15 Lac to every citizen’s account. The politicians used that to call Modi a liar and the media simply played along, throwing every ethic of journalism to the wind. This is just the tip of the iceberg in the saga of how politicians and their pens for hire have misquoted and maligned PM Modi ever since his Gujarat days, that how ‘project vilify Modi’ is still very much in progress. One has to wonder why the lobby is so desperate at this point in time. Perhaps because with the anti-CAA riots and Muslim mobs wreaking havoc, the carefully crafted narrative of how the only problem that ails India is that of “Hindutva” is falling apart, or because of Shaheen Bagh and how the media aided the Islamists there have exposed the true face of the cabal. Either way, the desperation of the pro-Islamist lobby is rather evident if they had to cling on to such strawman arguments to vilify the Prime Minister.\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"How pro-Islamist lobby is whitewashing threat by Omar Abdullah of Kashmir breaking away from India by attacking PM Modi\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2020/02/pro-islamist-lobby-lie-about-pm-modi-parliament-speech-omar-abdullah-mehbooba-mufti-kashmir-article-370/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\nnewrow13 = {'author': \"OpIndia Staff\",'content': \"With just 5 days to go for the assembly elections in Delhi, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal recited the Hanuman Chalisa during an event organised by a news channel.

He had said that Muslims chose to stay in India due to their property and other reasons. The BBC has a history of dubious reporting about India.

It was reported yesterday that a Muslim family supplying water to the neighbourhood stopped the supply to these Hindu families from January 17 after three among them reportedly participated in an event called ‘Janajagratha Sadass’ supporting CAA. This event was held at Valanchery town a week ago. According to a report in The Times Of India, Akhila Cherukunnu Parambil, a Hindu resident has said that the one Muslim family who supplied them water was pressurized by people of his community to stop supplying water to them, after photos of three men of the colony attending the pro-CAA program was circulated on a social media group. Akhila said that the water supply scheme of gram panchayat has not been functional for more than a year and that they were forced to travel about 1 km every day to fetch water. One Muslim family had been supplying water to the local people. “Recently, they arranged a facility to pump water from a water source to their home. They offered three buckets of water to each of the family in the colony. On Friday, a woman member of the family told us that photos of three men of the colony attending the pro-CAA programme as being circulating on a social media group in the locality and the family cannot continue to provide water as they were under pressure from a section of people to stop the supply”, said Akhila. CP Velayudhan, a former CPM branch committee member, also confirmed that since the Muslim family had suddenly stopped supplying water many people in the colony, irrespective of party affiliations, were affected. However, Sainudheen Kalappadathil, a member of the Muslim family has been quoted by the TOI report that the water supply was hindered due to some technical problem. For the last three days, RSS’ Seva Bharati has stepped in and have been supplying water to the colony. Following the boycott of Hindus by Muslims, there is widespread anger for blocking the basic necessity of these residents. It is pertinent to note that Malappuram in Kerala has one of the highest concentration of Muslim population and according to Census data nearly 70% of residents of the district are Muslims. Shobha Karandlaje, the BJP MP from Karnataka flagged the issue on social media stating that Hindus of Kuttipuram Panchayat of Malappuram was denied water supply as they supported the Citizenship Amendment Act. The BJP MP also expressed her fear regarding communist Kerala taking baby steps to become another Kashmir. Taking a cue from her, many BJP leaders raised the issue through their Twitter handles on Thursday, following which the revenue authorities decided to convene an all-party meeting and take immediate steps to restore the water supply. Now, there has been an FIR lodged against Karandlaje for ‘promoting religious enmity’. Tirur tahsildar T Murali, who visited the colony on Thursday said that revenue authorities will file a detailed report of the incident to district collector Jafar Malik on Friday. “Panchayat authorities will take immediate steps to provide water to the colony,” he said.

On a personality basis, Narendra Modi was even further ahead and Rahul was simply nowhere. And now, it is time to analyse the Delhi elections according to Google Trends. The election turned out exactly the same way. Here is what the map looked like in the 30 days before April 24, 2019. Blue for the BJP and red for the Congress. On April 24, 2019, Google Trends said India was an ocean of blue. How was the Congress going to win when nobody even cared about what they had to say? I had also pointed out how Google Trends appears to have accurately captured the Congress surge in the three Hindi heartland states in Dec 2018. Just look at the Google Trends map for the period Sept 1, 2018, to Dec 1, 2018. See how the BJP seems ahead almost all across the Hindi heartland except for Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the three election-bound states. If Google’s wisdom seems so profound in states with huge rural populations, surely it should be taken even more seriously in Delhi. A purely urban electorate saturated with media and the internet. So what does the BJP vs AAP comparison look like in the last 30 days in Delhi? First of all, take a moment to admire just how accurately Google Trends picks up what is going on in the minds of the public. What is that sharp red spike for AAP? It’s from Jan 14, 2020. And when did AAP announce its candidates? On Jan 14, 2020, of course! You don’t even have to look that up. Google Trends knows everything. But other than that, the BJP (blue) dominates over AAP (red) almost uniformly. And you can see that interest in BJP is peaking, rising almost in hockey-stick fashion. This is bad news for AAP. Wait! There is an obvious objection and one must address it here. The BJP is a national party, while AAP is not. Perhaps BJP is getting more interest simply because people think about BJP in the context of a much wider range of issues, while AAP only matters in local politics? So let us see the related searches for BJP in Delhi, according to Google trends. It is evident that all these searches are related to the state election and not national issues. So we know two things for sure. First, BJP is getting much more interest in Delhi than AAP is. Second, the interest in BJP is driven primarily by local issues and not national issues. Now I know there are some opinion poll agencies (with absolutely pathetic track records, I must add) which have projected the Delhi election as some kind of one way victory for AAP. I don’t trust them. I’d rather look at Google Trends data. By now, everyone has noticed that Kejriwal has maintained a safe distance from the CAA issue. He’s stayed away from Shaheen Bagh. In fact, in recent days, top liberals have also been begging with Shaheen Bagh protesters to temporarily withdraw their movement for strategic reasons. Is Kejriwal confident? I doubt this. Again, keep in mind that Delhi is a 100% urban environment where media and internet matters a lot. And AAP is media savvy, known to have an extensive online presence. Despite this, Google Trends shows interest in BJP clearly ahead of AAP. One last thing. AAP is synonymous with Kejriwal. How about we compare BJP vs Arvind Kejriwal? Again, pretty big and uniform lead for BJP and the gap only widening in the last few days. If you ask me, that’s the classic surge that the winner gets towards the end.\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"If you believe Google Trends, BJP has an advantage over AAP in Delhi: Here is how\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2020/01/delhi-assembly-elections-google-trands-aap-bjp/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\nnewrow18 = {'author': \"OpIndia Staff\",'content': \"The radical Islamic organization Popular Front of India (PFI) has heaped praises on the Congress party after the Chhattisgarh government approached the Supreme Court demanding the declaration of NIA Act of 2008 as unconstitutional. Ironically, the law that the Congress government in the state seeks to be declared unconstitutional was passed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2008. In a statement issued by PFI, they said that PFI national general secretary M Mohammed Ali Jinnah welcomed the Chhatisgarh government’s decision and urged the other non-BJP governments to approach the Supreme Court as well. Jinnah said that the law was against the “spirit of federalism”. Another government that received great compliments from the PFI was Pinarayi Vijayan’s government in Kerala. The statement said, “Kerala has set a good example by officially approaching the apex court against the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act. As a state where there are many instances of the misuse of the NIA Act and UAPA, Kerala state government can be in the forefront to follow the example of the Chhattisgarh government and challenge both the laws.” The statement concluded with the words, “Taking the seriousness of the situation into account, Popular Front appeals other non-BJP state governments to align themselves with Chhattisgarh in raising this demand and to save constitution and federal character of the country.” The National Investigation Agency Act 2008 conferred powers to the Central Government to form the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to combat terror in India. The agency acts as the Central Counter-Terrorism Law Enforcement Agency and is empowered to deal with terror-related crimes across states without special permission from the states. The involvement of PFI was suspected in the recent anti-CAA riots across the country.

Within six months of Narendra Modi’s second term as Prime Minister, his government took several monumental steps to strengthen the territorial integrity of India as well as bring to closure disputes that have festered in the country ever since independence. MEA Jaishankar, too, has on several occasions hinted towards the fact that the current government wishes to resolve disputes that it has inherited from predecessors. Narendra Modi has always demonstrated remarkable clarity in matters of governance and politics. It was, perhaps, most evident during a debate on the Big Fight with Rajdeep Sardesai as the anchor in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks almost two decades ago. During the debate, he called out the mentality and the worldview that is now amplified by the anti-CAA protesters when they made ‘La ilaha ilallah’ the central theme of their protests. In the debate, Narendra Modi said, “Indian media never had the courage to use the term Islamic Terrorism because pseudo-secularism weighed heavily upon them. When, last Tuesday, after the attack in the USA, when global newspapers started using the term, then for the first time, and I wish to compliment Rajdeep Sardesai for the same, that they have demonstrated the courage to say the truth.” However, immediately, Rajdeep Sardesai “clarifies” that NDTV had not used the world “Islamic terrorism” in its reports. “We don’t need the compliments from you,” Rajdeep is heard saying in the video clip just after Narendra Modi’s opening remarks. Narendra Modi, who hadn’t become the Chief Minister of Gujarat yet, added, “As far as Islam is concerned, it has numerous positive aspects, yes. The question is, in what way is it being used by people today. Where do the roots of it lie? When one community argues that their community is different from everyone and superior when it is argued that until and unless you adopt my ways, you will not be able to attain Moksh, Allah or Jesus, then conflict is bound to arise.” He continued, “And I believe, India has advocated the philosophy of Truth is one but approaching it is many. If this remains the root of one’s ideology, that every path is equal, then there’s no possibility of conflict. But when I argue that yours is false, mine is true, conflict arises and hatred manifests itself. And when this hatred combines with sentiments of nationalism, then terrorism occurs.” The politician who would go on to fundamentally alter the direction of the Indian State also said that instead of criticising Islam as a whole, it would be better to focus on those elements who are using it to further their nefarious agenda. Rajdeep Sardesai, true to his nature, quickly retorts, “We haven’t used the term Islamic Terrorism, we have only raised the question. So we don’t need the compliments from you at the moment.” The words spoken by Narendra Modi almost two decades ago are still relevant to this day. The notions of supremacy that he alluded to during the debate are relevant to this day as can be seen in the manner in which ‘la ilaha ilallah’ was made the central chorus of the anti-CAA crowd. ‘La ilaha ilallah’ is a declaration that means ‘There is no God but Allah’. It’s a slogan that denies the existence of all Hindu Gods and Goddesses and calls them false. That it has been made the central focus of political protests ought to concern every sensible citizen of the country. Even Shashi Tharoor, one of the most ‘secular’ politicians from the Congress party was disturbed by it and when he called it out, he faced intense criticism and protests from the anti-CAA crowd. Later in the debate, Narendra Modi further elucidates the manner in which terrorism manifests itself. He said, speaking of the ideology of the terrorists, “Terrorism has reached the strength it has today because it is intertwined with fundamentalism. You have to understand that Muslims, and when I say Muslims I do not mean Islam, they have divided the world into three parts.” Explaining himself, he said, “One, Dar-ul-Aman, second, Dar-ul-Harb, third, Dar-ul-Islam. Dar-ul-Aman means land of peace, that is, where Islam has reached or not in a position to assert itself. There, peace should prevail. Then Dar-ul-Harb, where you have the strength, fight for it, plant your flag. And the third is Dar-ul-Islam, to convert the whole world to Islam. To this end, certain political activists who belong to the Islamic faith are indulging in these activities. Until and unless we understand these people, we will not be able to tackle terrorism.” As expected, Modi set the cat among the pigeons with his explanation of the ideology that motivates terrorists. Rajdeep Sardesai, consistent with his nature, tried to interrupt him on several occasions but he managed to get his points across in spite of the cacophony. Narendra Modi did not stray away from his points even when accusations of Islamophobia were levelled at him. He said clearly that he was not levelling allegations at the entire Muslim community but only explaining the motivations that drive terrorists to commit the crimes they do.\" ,\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"20 years ago, Narendra Modi called out the mentality behind Islamic terrorism on NDTV, and Rajdeep Sardesai was upset\", 'url': np.nan, 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\nnewrow20 = {'author': \"K Bhattacharjee\",'content': \"The 20th Century witnessed two of the bloodiest wars in the entirety of human history. More than seven decades have passed since the end of the second world war and as it happens very often, much of what was known, or should have been known, has been forgotten. However, there are certain patterns that can be deduced through observation alone. And it is those aspects that we shall focus on here. In the second world war, unlike what has traditionally been believed, there were three totalitarian ideologies competing for supremacy, arguably at a global scale. The three primary actors, certainly the three most powerful ones, were the flagbearers of these totalitarian ideologies. One of the ideologies was vanquished in the second world war, another at the end of the cold war. The one that emerged victorious on both these occasions still survives and expectedly, it is not considered totalitarian in the 21st century. The first, of course, was Nazism and the second was Communism. The third, which emerged victorious against both these ideologies, was, needless to say, Liberalism. Nazism ceased to be a serious political force with the end of Hitler’s Germany. Communism suffered the same fate with the dismemberment of the Soviet Union. Liberalism, however, is the state ideology of the world’s only superpower: The USA. People may argue Liberalism is not totalitarian in nature and everyone has human rights and freedom of speech but one must also reconcile themselves with the fact that people who live in a totalitarian regime do not consider the regime to be totalitarian. For instance, it’s extremely unlikely that in the world George Orwell created in 1948, the residents perceived the state to be totalitarian. For them, a totalitarian society was ‘normal’. Similarly, people who live in a liberal society are unlikely to consider it tyranny. It’s only from the outside that it looks totalitarian. In the 20th century, the similarities between these three ideologies wasn’t so apparent as these three ideologies were at war with each other. However, in the 21st Century, as Liberalism’s stranglehold over power became nearly complete backed by military prowess of the US military, the similarities have become more than apparent. Today, we look at some of glowing similarities between Liberalism and Fascism. Adolf Hitler, as we are well aware, was obsessed with the supposed superiority of the ‘Aryan Race’. In his bid to ‘secure the future’ of the ‘Aryan Race’, he committed the genocide of Jews in Germany. Similarly, liberals in the West are obsessed with race too. In fact, they are so obsessed that a strong candidate for the Democrat nominee for US Presidential elections in 2020 lied about her race and claimed that she is Native American despite the fact she is not in order to gain political benefits. Furthermore, prominent liberals in the US can be regularly found to be engaged in anti-White rhetoric where they can be seen cheering for ‘White Genocide’, all the while denying that such a thing exists. In India, liberals are obsessed with the Aryan-Dravidian race theory despite the fact that it has been regularly debunked by scholars and academics. But that hasn’t stopped Indian liberals from continuing to further the race theory. The obsession that liberals have with race is very similar to that shared by Nazi Germany. In India, the rhetoric that liberals employ against Brahmins is akin to the one employed by Nazi Germany against Jews. In mainstream Dravidian politics, which is cheered on and encouraged and sustained by liberalism, the propaganda against Brahmins are is completely alike that fueled by Nazis against Jews. In Nazi Germany, the media served as the propaganda wing of the fascist government. We see a similar pattern in the liberal world. The media was an extended arm of the Nazis. In the USA, we see the mainstream media act as the propaganda wing of the Democrat party. The collusion that was observed between news networks and Hillary Clinton was for all to see. The liberal American media has even justified violence by Antifa goons against their political opponents. In India, we see the mainstream media serve as the propaganda wing of the ‘Secular’ parties. There is extreme collusion between the political establishment and the media. The Liberal media demonizes the opponents of secular political parties and their supporters, exaggerates minor events in order to benefit secular politicians and whitewashes and buries news that could adversely impact secular parties. It’s an incestuous relationship between Liberal Media and Liberal political parties and they work together in the same fashion as the media and politicians in Nazi Germany. However, there is one distinct difference between the media-politics nexus in the world of liberalism and Nazism. In Nazi Germany, no efforts were made to hide the relationship. But liberalism, in order to be more effective, claims to be ‘independent’ and ‘neutral’ even when they are clearly not and buries the incestuous relationship under layers and layers of carefully constructed diversions. The relationship between the Media and politicians in Nazi Germany and in the Liberal World stems from the ideological unity between them, the material benefits that are gained are only a second-order requirement. Loyalty to ideology is the main motivation. In Nazi Germany, the Academia served the Nazis greatly and even helped shape their ideology and provided them with ideas and techniques to help them achieve their nefarious objectives. We see a similar pattern in the liberal world. The political parties rely on academia for acquiring footsoldiers and legitimizing their evil agenda while the latter relies on the former for patronage. The Academia also provides Liberal politicians with footsoldiers and innovative techniques in order for them to achieve their political goals. Here, again, we see a complete unity of ideology between the Academia and Liberal political parties. It is the same in the US as it is in India. The liberal parties work in tandem in order to indoctrinate the youth and achieve ideological objectives. In Nazi Germany, there was complete coherence of ideology between the political establishment, the Media and Academia. A similar pattern is also observed in the world of Liberalism. The three departments, together, with complete ideological unity between them, form the Liberal Establishment in the 21st century. The arms of the Liberal Establishment then work in tandem, like Nazi Germany, to crush dissent and entrench itself in the corridors of power. The Liberal Establishment crushes dissent, demonizes its opponent unfairly and unceremoniously removes them from power all the while accusing their political opponent of being fascists, despite the fact that it is the structure of their politics that is completely akin to Nazi Germany. No stones are left unturned in order to secure their power. In India, the Liberal Establishment has also engaged in the genocide of Hindus and Sikhs, in Kashmir and in 1984 respectively. The three arms of the Liberal Establishment attack and defend together. Whenever the power of one arm is under threat, the other arms immediately comes to their defense. For instance, when there is a threat to its political power, the academia and the media immediately rushes to their defense in order to defeat its political opponents. When political rivals attempt to remove stranglehold of liberals in academia, political parties and the media rushes to its defense. When the monopoly of liberals over media is threatened, the academia and political parties rush to provide cover. And together, they fight to ensure that the Liberal Establishment continues to thrive. Simultaneously, the opponents of the Liberal Establishment are crushed by the three arms together and it’s ensured that opposing ideologies never get a foothold in these institutions. If someone or some entity succeeds in gaining legitimacy in these three arms, then they demonized and every effort is made to tarnish their reputation and destroy their lives. In many instances, people actually lose their lives and their death is brushed under the carpet as an insignificant statistic. And on and on it goes. The most distinguishing feature of a totalitarian society or a totalitarian ideology is that the power structure isn’t merely interested in what an individual says or how he acts but also how people think. It is not enough to merely say or act in a certain way, a person must also believe the ideology completely. Otherwise, the person can be accused of a ‘thoughtcrime’ and persecuted accordingly. In George Orwell’s 1984, ‘thoughtcrime’ describes a person’s politically unorthodox thoughts, such as unspoken beliefs and doubts that contradict the dominant political ideology. We see a similar pattern playing out in the liberal world. Merely accusations and allegations combined with certain ‘suspicious’ behaviour is enough reason to completely destroy an individual’s life. For instance, a person does not have to be a ‘homophobe’ or ‘misogynist’ in order to have his life completely destroyed and ruined, mere accusations are enough. Furthermore, anyone who does not endorse the most extreme positions of the Liberal world is branded ‘homophobe’, ‘misogynist’, ‘regressive’ or whatever the latest buzzword maybe and then it is demanded that his professional career be destroyed. Mere differences in political opinions are treated as thoughtcrimes and efforts are undertaken to crush the individual. Everyone who disagrees with a liberal is Sanghi and fascist against whom even violence is justified. ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans and chants of ‘Vande Mataram’ are deemed as provocations.\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"Liberalism and Fascism: 5 ways in which ‘liberals’ are exactly the same as Nazis\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2020/01/similarities-between-liberals-fascists-nazis/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\nnewrow21 = {'author': \"OpIndia Staff\",'content': \"Congress MLA from Jharkhand, Irfan Ansari, has stooped to a new low after another disgraceful comment on the Prime Minister.

Swatantra Dev Singh’s remarks come after Akhilesh Yadav had said that the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) were against the poor and minorities of the country while claiming that he will not fill up the NPR form. Singh said that there is nothing wrong in the NPR as it provides simple options like the presentation of Aadhaar card or driving license or confirmation by three residents of the area that the person is a bonafide resident of the area.

Quite obviously, the converse also holds true. Nothing defeats like defeat. In the aftermath of a defeat, people are prone to making mistakes that could trap them in a vicious cycle of defeat. A similar pattern is unfolding before our eyes following the spectacular failure of the Liberal Establishment’s anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (anti-CAA) campaign. For the first time in a long time, we witnessed the public collaboration between opposition parties, the mainstream media, the Far-Left mafia in Universities and Muslim Extremists on the streets engaging in rampant mob violence. While the strength of the alliance came mainly from Muslim extremists, they were also the greatest liability for the other camps as the public demonstration of Islamic extremism only worked towards consolidating public opinion in favour of the government. To be sure, it was a very volatile alliance from the very beginning. Unlike the Hindutva camp, which is united by shared blood, history, culture, traditions and heritage, it’s only opportunism that is holding the Liberal Establishment together. The Opposition parties tolerate Islamic Extremism as it fetches them votes. The mainstream media largely acts as the propaganda wing of the Opposition parties. It’s only the Far-Left Mafia in Universities that sympathize with Islamic Extremists as the former is stupid enough to believe that the latter has genuine grievances and both of them share the same hatred towards the Hindu Samaj. Moreover, in Urban areas, Muslim mobs provide the Leftist intelligentsia with the muscle power that it desires. It was only the promise of a victory that was holding them all together. However, since the General Elections of 2019, it has been one defeat after another and the CAA was the last straw. The Liberal Establishment decided to mount one final push but it, too, did not achieve the desired results. Let us be clear here, the anti-CAA protests were a catastrophic defeat for the Liberal Establishment. Public opinion has definitively consolidated behind the government and the Establishment is recognizing this. Thus, we are witnessing this alliance of opportunism fall apart right before our very eyes as every distinct group looks to preserve their own interests. It is quite unlike the Hindutva alliance where every subgroup realizes that it floats and sinks as a collective. Here, it is just an alliance of convenience. When confronted with a defeat, every subgroup of the Liberal Establishment looks to secure its own interests first. And that is how the carefully constructed alliance unravels. The first instance of it was demonstrated when Aysha Renna, one of the faces of the Jamia protests and someone who has supported terrorist Yakub Memon in the past, was heckled by Communists after she spoke out against Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan. She was forced to issue a public apology over her remark against Vijayan. The second instance was when senior Congress leader Shashti Tharoor spoke out against the rampant display of Islamic Extremism in the anti-CAA protests and was thoroughly rebuked by the new leaders of the Muslim community. Tharoor had only remarked that the slogans of “There is no God but Allah” went against the ethos of pluralism and diversity they were trying to protect. Shashi Tharoor’s comments was an act of self-preservation by the Congress party. The party realized that the overt display of Islamic Extremism could cost them a lot in future elections and hence, had to disassociate themselves from it. But the new Muslim leaders stepped in and these new leaders are now trying to assume the leadership of the Muslim community and ensure that the votes do not continue to flow in the account of the ‘secular’ parties anymore. Shehla Rashid stepped in and claimed that the anti-CAA protests were a Muslim struggle and it was the liberals who were trying to hijack their movement. The message was clear, the new Muslim leader no longer wants to outsource the leadership of the community to the ‘secular’ parties. They now want to become the face of the community and their political representatives themselves. The hardline stance by Shehla Rashid and other Muslims has forced Shashi Tharoor to backtrack from his earlier statement regarding Muslim extremism because at the end of the day, the ‘secular’ parties desperately need the Muslim votes to stay relevant. The Congress party is now stuck between a hard place and a rock. There is no good outcome for them out of this. Meanwhile, Shehla Rashid’s stance doesn’t appear to be particularly smart as well considering the fact that Muslim identity politics will hugely consolidate support for the BJP and there’s no good thing that could possibly come of this. The slogans of “Ladhke lenge Azadi” and “Chheen ke lengey Azadi” ended up with one Muslim protester shitting his pants quite literally. As crude as it may sound, it’s the truth. Furthermore, the demonstration of Muslim Extremism during the anti-CAA protests gave the BJP governments sufficient leeway to brutally put down the protests. In the end, the Maulanas were left begging for mercy and tons of others were left with severe injuries that would take a long time to heal. The major lesson to learn is this: Muslim identity politics will no longer work in India. The people of this country have decided it is not something that they will tolerate any longer. Therefore, any attempt at Muslim identity politics will only benefit the BJP and give them more leeway in dealing with any potential outburst of violence. Worryingly enough, Shehla Rashid also appears to have delivered the final nail in the coffin for the Dalit-Muslim Unity Project. She is now advocating for the invasion of Muslims into benefits reserved for the Dalit community. She claims ‘Dalit Muslims’ should be granted the opportunity to receive benefits under reservations for the Dalit Community. In reality, there is nothing called Dalit Muslims. As ‘Eminent Historians’ keep telling us, Caste is intrinsic to only the Hindu faith and the egalitarian nature of Islam is what forced many to convert in order to escape the oppressive caste system. Therefore, people cannot turn around now and claim that caste is a feature of the Muslim community too. More fundamentally, Shehla Rashid’s demands mean that Dalits will now have to sacrifice their share of reservations and accommodate Muslims in order to achieve Dalit-Muslim Unity. The Dalit Community was already turning more and more towards Hindutva and this demand by Shehla Rashid, that Dalits sacrifice a portion of their reservations for Muslims, will further drive a wedge between the two communities. All in all, the entire edifice of the Liberal Establishment is crumbling apart and every group is struggling to preserve their own interests at the expense of the other. Liberals thought they could milk Islamic Extremism for votes. The Islamic Extremists believe they could use Liberals to further their own extremist agenda. The Leftist intelligentsia was under the illusion that it could be used to usher in an era of revolution where unicorns farted rainbows. At the end of it all, however, the only one that gets to benefit from all of this is the BJP. Members of the ruling dispensation must be watching all the events unfold with popcorn in their hands.\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"Nothing Defeats like Defeat: Liberals thought they were using Islamic extremism to retain power, they received a rude shock\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2019/12/anti-caa-protests-liberals-islamic-extremism-power-rude-shock/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\nnewrow25 = {'author': \"OpIndia Staff\",'content': \"A shocking video has been shared by Times Now, in which an acclaimed Tamil writer, Nellai Kannan has made a despicable remark against Home Minister Amit Shah. Like many far-left liberals, he is also seen indulging in hate-mongering by calling for Amit Shah’s murder. Brazenly attempting to incite the Muslims, the Tamil academician is heard telling the crowd that “he expected but no Muslim doing it”, hinting that he expected that the Muslims in the country would kill Home Minister Amit Shah for implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act, which they have been falsely claiming to be anti-Muslims, but no Muslim has yet killed him. Nellai Kannan said this at a rally by Islamist organisation SDPI. Nellai Kannan has fought elections on a Congress ticket in the past and is largely viewed as a Congress supporting voice. The Islamist outfit PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after merging three fringe Muslim outfits – the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of the Tamil Nadu – to protect “interest of the backward and oppressed people.” In Kerala, most of its leaders were members of the banned Student Islamic Movement of India. Reportedly, the PFI was allegedly involved in at least 24 political murders in Kerala. The Islamist outfits Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and its sister organisation PFI Popular Front of India have been accused of extreme communalism and has a long history of resorting to violence against their political opponents. The PFI is also accused by the National Investigation Agency for being involved in love-jihad cases in Kerala. Recently, the SDPI members were also arrested in connection with the brutal murder of ABVP worker in Kannur. Recently, PFI members were accused of killing 42-year-old activist Ramalingam. The activist was brutally murdered for opposing religious conversion. The accused PFI members have been preaching conversion to Islam. In December, two people, former members of the extremist Islamist organisation, Popular Front of India (PFI) had joined the IS. The police said that K Sajjad and Anwar Poothappara had links with the radical Islamic outfit in the past. The anti-CAA Muslim mob has been on a rampage in various parts of the country since the Citizenship Act was brought in by the Modi government. While several Pakistani Hindu migrants across the country have been celebrating and lauding the passing of the historic Citizenship Amendment Act, which has brought their lost hope back, Muslim mobs had gone on a rampage, destroying public property and creating chaos. In fact, UP DGP OP Singh had said that members of radical Islamic organisations – Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political front, Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), including political parties like Samajwadi Party were involved in instigating Muslim mobs to indulge in violence across the state during the anti-CAA protests. Three people associated with the radical Islamic organisation PFI, including UP state head Waseem, have been arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police for orchestrating violence by spreading misinformation through social media platforms. While the anti-CAA lobby has been resorting to severe violence, stone pelting, vandalism and arson to voice their dissent, the left-brigade has been continuously trying to incite the citizens against the government. On December 19, a video surfaced in which a Maulana was heard passing derogatory remarks against India’s PM Narendra Modi and HM Amit Shah, threatening to wage ‘jihad’ in India as he rejects to accept the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) bill by falsely claiming that they are anti-Muslim.\",\n'nationalist': 1, 'title': \"‘I expected but no Muslims doing it’: Tamil Congress politician and writer Nellai Kannan incites Muslims to kill Amit Shah at rally of Islamist SDPI\", 'url': \"https://www.opindia.com/2019/12/tamil-scholar-nellai-kannan-incites-muslims-sdpi-rally-to-murder-amit-shah-for-caa/\", 'date': np.nan, 'tag': np.nan, 'website':np.nan}\n\n#here's where you add all the new rows you make above to the table\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow2, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow3, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow4, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow5, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow6, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow7, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow8, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow9, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow10, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow11, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow12, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow13, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow14, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow15, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow16, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow17, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow18, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow19, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow20, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow21, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow22, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow23, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow24, ignore_index=True)\nnationalist_table = nationalist_table.append(newrow25, ignore_index=True)","execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00015-b306cefa-adef-4ed0-a8fe-57d19a2d1406","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"66bc0f23","execution_millis":1,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_start":1612132055521,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"#Roshun Article Update Cell\npolitics.loc[[10786], 'nationalist'] = 1\npolitics.loc[[7515], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[11018], 'nationalist'] = 1\npolitics.loc[[9844], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[11107], 'nationalist'] = 1\npolitics.loc[[9264], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[9264], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[4780], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[14408], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[12589], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[2114], 'nationalist'] = 0\npolitics.loc[[7551], 'nationalist'] = 0\n","execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py:1720: SettingWithCopyWarning: \nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n  self._setitem_single_column(loc, value, pi)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00016-cbe331e7-783c-4a17-aaba-7678883c6b52","output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"844b9624","execution_millis":17,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_start":1612132055522,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"#Roshun Work Cell (for table sorting, randomly drawing articles, etc)\n\n\n#creation of dummy training set -

The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a \"Bahujan\" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of \"Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak\" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and \"Gau-Brahman prati palak\" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as \"Rayate cha Raja\" (king of the ryots). \r\n \r\n Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ","nationalist":0,"_deepnote_index_column":15342},{"content":"The Crime Investigation Department of the Gujarat Police on Wednesday arrested former Indian Police Service officer Sanjiv Bhatt for allegedly planting drugs on a lawyer who was held from Palanpur in Banaskantha district in 1996,   reported. Bhatt, who was the Banaskantha superintendent of police at the time, and seven others – including former policemen attached with the Banaskantha police – are being questioned, said Director General of Police (CID) Ashish Bhatia. The district police led by Bhatt had arrested Sumersingh Rajpurohit for possessing around a kilogramme of opium. The police had claimed the drugs were found in a hotel room occupied by Rajpurohit in Palanpur.  However, the Rajasthan Police later concluded that Rajpurohit had been falsely implicated by Bhatt and other police officers. They also claimed that the Banaskantha police had abducted Rajpurohit from his residence at Pali in Rajasthan. In his complaint, the lawyer alleged that the police officers had implicated him in the case to force his family to vacate a rented premises owned by the sister of former Gujarat High Court judge Ramanlal Rajmal Jain.  “Three to four months back, the Gujarat High Court had asked the CID to investigate this case and we had formed a Special Investigation Team, which found Sanjiv Bhatt had made out a false case against the lawyer,” Bhatia told  .  Bhatt is a vocal critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ","nationalist":0,"_deepnote_index_column":15286},{"content":"West Bengal residents were treated to a curious sight on Sunday, the day Ram Navami was celebrated across the country. Both BJP and the ruling Trinamool Congress were trying to outdo each other in holding  . In some rallies, TMC leaders reportedly even ditched the party flag in favour of saffron headband! There are two ways of looking at the competitive celebrations of a Hindu festival that marked West Bengal's political landscape. One, though a nascent force in Bengal, BJP has already succeeded in triggering a fundamental shift in the state's political discourse. Two, Mamata Banerjee is trying to pro-actively nip in the bud BJP's attempts to consolidate the Hindu votes. These statements are not at variance with each other. If we look at the political discourse leading up to the 2016 Assembly elections, the focus was on unabashed minorityism. At roughly 30 percent, Bengal has a sizeable Muslim population. Through her policies and politics, the Trinamool Congress chief was   the 'votebank'. Soon after ending Left's three-decade stranglehold over Bengal and rising to power in 2011,   a state-sponsored monthly stipend of Rs 2500 and \"own land, own house\" for each of the state's \"30000 to 40000\" imams. Over the years, she has   this strategy. The Bengal chief minister has set up Haj houses, new campus for Aliah University, sanctioned 400 madrasa hostels, and introduced scholarships for Muslim students,  reported. If any criticism for these policies came her way, Mamata showed a remarkable intolerance for dissent and an autocratic style of functioning, quite unlike the \"liberal icon\" image that she is of late trying to promote. In September 2012,   reported how police tried to intimidate the publishers of a book written in Bengali by a senior police officer criticizing Banerjee's policies. The 102-page book Musalamander Koroniyo (What Muslims Should Do) written by Narzul Islam — then the additional director general of the West Bengal police — had criticized the chief minister's move to allow stipends for imams and plans to \"recognize 10,000 madrasas\". According to  police raided the College Street office of the book’s Kolkata publisher, Mitra & Ghosh\". Publisher Indrani Roy told the US-based newspaper that \"government has tried to intimidate us in different ways\". The report further stated, \"Roy said she believes the raid, the first in the publisher’s 80-year history, stems from Banerjee’s intolerance to criticism. 'It is rather unnerving,' she said. 'We are actually very scared. Our freedom is at stake and who knows what will happen tomorrow'.\" These days, however,   that \"only West Bengal can fight against this communal politics and intolerance and save the country.\" During the campaign stage for 2016 Assembly polls, huge cutouts of the chief minister — head covered in white chador and arms joined in prayers to the Almighty — were ubiquitous. Mamata also religiously attended iftaar parties. As an  report from June 2016 notes, \"Banerjee can be seen attending several fast-breaking ceremonies with her cabinet colleagues. With her   and her colleagues wearing skull caps. Banerjee can be even heard quoting Urdu couplets in a bid to display her skills with the language and familiarity with the community.\" Mamata's campaign speeches in Muslim-majority areas ended with an invocation to Allah, as a report in   in April 2016 noted. \"Allah ho Akbar,' she (Mamata) cries out, adding, 'La Ilah Ilalah Mohammad un Rasool Allah. Inshallah, paribartan hobe (God willing, there will be change).' For West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, no stump speech is complete without a string of invocations aimed at Muslims, who number close to 28 per cent of the State’s population\". Her zeal often led to decisions that drew condemnation from the courts. The Bengal chief minister has been   Calcutta High Court for trying to \"appease the minority section of the public at the cost of the majority section without there being any plausible justification\". Her attempts to prevent the BJP from holding a rally in the state has been quashed. Mamata evidently believed that she can afford to pay a small cost for consolidation of Muslim votes. Two things happened in 2016 Assembly polls. One, the Left and Congress were decimated despite forming an alliance. Two, BJP emerged as the chief Opposition. It didn't take long for Mamata to realise that the Left and the Congress are no longer a threat to TMC. She also realized the need now to focus her attention on BJP, a party that is cadre-based, organised and is adept at playing the waiting game. Mamata drew some quick conclusions. If the Left and Congress are insignificant in Bengal, then there is no longer any need for TMC to attempt a Muslim consolidation. Conversely, she needed to quickly move and prevent BJP's attempts to consolidate the Hindu votes by portraying Mamata as \"anti-Hindu\". Theoretically, even if Mamata succeeds in getting the backing of state's Muslim population, any consolidation of Hindu votes as a countermeasure would damage her politically. The 2017 Ram Navami celebrations, organised by the RSS across Bengal, drew  . It was enough to tell Mamata that she needs a quick resetting of her priorities. The zeal of TMC ministers in snatching Ram away from BJP during Sunday's celebrations was a culmination of this \"reset\" that Mamata has embarked on since last year. Gone were the huge cutouts in strategic locations of the city. On April 2017, Mamata had tweeted: Around this time, Anubrata Mondal, a party leader and a Mamata loyalist, was quoted as  : \"There are 127 Bajrangbali (other name for Hanuman) temples in Birbhum district. On Wednesday evening in each of the temples, puja will be held. All our legislators and other party leaders and workers will take part. We will worship Bajrangbali everywhere.\" In January 2018, TMC organised a   in Bolpur town of Birbhum district where thousands of priests and attendees were given \"a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a shawl and pictures of Sarada Maa and Ramakrishna\" ostensibly to teach them \"real meaning of Hinduism\". Rahul Gandhi's temple run during last year's Gujarat elections seemed to   as well. It is in this context that we must see TMC leaders' zeal in taking out Ram Navami processions and state food minister   armed with a mace. .  reported that Arup Roy, a state minister, has said \"the chief minister had asked all key party functionaries to take out rallies every Sunday until the upcoming panchayat election.\" The winds of change are evident. Trinamool's shift from blatant minorityism to soft Hindutva is in sync with similar attempts from the Congress at the national level. Notably, both parties are at pains to insist that they have been wrongly portrayed as \"pro-Muslim\" in the past, and their temple visits and taking up of Hindu causes are not examples of \"soft Hindutva\" but a move to deny BJP the chance to project itself as the sole savior of Hinduism. Both claim that doing so does not make them \"any less secular\". It is here that BJP has scored a major victory. Under Narendra Modi, the party has reinvented \"secularism\", breaking its unanimity with \"minorityism\". What we are witnessing in Bengal is TMC's attempt to respond to this changed definition. The likely repercussions of this churning (disempowerment of Muslims, for one) will be evident over time. What is of immediate interest is how it affects voter behavior. By all purposes, we should get a definitive answer by 2019.","nationalist":1,"_deepnote_index_column":8002},{"content":"An unidentified person hurled a shoe at AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi when he was addressing a rally at Nagpada in south Mumbai on Tuesday, 23 January, the police said.

In a press release by Anoop George Chaudhary from the AICC legal cell, the Supreme Court unit of the AICC has clarified that they have nothing to do with the PIL filed by Poonawalla over the Rafale issue. The press release states that Poonawalla’s PIL seeks for the disclosure of the renegotiated price of the Rafale deal and the party explicitly denied any involvement in the PIL as it has been filed on Poonawalla’s individual capacity. The press release goes further to insist that the Congress party does not have even the ‘remotest’ connection with the PIL or Poonawalla and the party thinks that the apex court is not the forum for raising such issues. The letter concludes by reasserting that the party in no way can be linked to Poonawalla or his PIL. It is notable here that Tehseen Poonawalla , who is a vocal supporter of the Congress party and the brother-in-law of Robert Vadra, had filed a PIL in the SC seeking the disclosure of the renegotiated Rafale deal in March 2018 .

Similarly, Sunil Chhetri’s feat of equaling Lionel Messi’s record for the number of international goals may seem paler when one compares the quality of their respective opponents. The Indian policy space is facing a novel tussle between the quantity and quality of administrative achievements. Having aced successive political communication battles, the BJP-led NDA government has also established its own paradigm for communication of governance-related results. After all, what are the chances of the median voter digging into headline data? Such onerous exercises attract only a small section of the society. For instance, in April 2018, the government claimed that India had achieved 100 percent electrification. The devil in the detail emerged only when some pointed out that 100 percent village electrification   mean 100 percent  electrification. There are, in fact, over 3 crore rural households without any access to electricity. An electrified village, on the other hand, is defined as a village with access to basic electricity infrastructure, and where public places and at least 10 percent households have been electrified. An ODF village is one where no visible fecal matter can be found in the surroundings, and where all households and public institutions use “safe technology option for disposal of faeces”. Remarkably, the number of ODF villages has increased by 725 percent, from around 47 thousand in 2015-16 to almost 3.88 lakh (as of 25 June 2018). As per guidelines, once a   declares itself as ODF, at least two inspections – within the subsequent 3 and 9 months – are to be carried out to confirm the same. It seems though, that around 90 thousand of these villages have not been verified. Quality and sustainability of the scheme across these villages is not beyond doubt, and therefore, neither is the claim that 17 of the country’s states/UTs can be deemed as ODF. The fact that   for ODF verification suggest that  two inspections be carried out, provides no incentives for the local administration to continue with similar exercises. Yet, an increase of 3.41 lakh in the number of ODF villages sounds like a massive achievement (and is an important part of an otherwise incomplete story). Similarly, the government’s claim to have saved Rs 90,000 crores owing to its Direct Benefit Transfer initiative should merit plaudits. As per official claims, most of these savings have been made owing to de-duplication and deletion of fake or non-existent beneficiaries from official records. Yet, MGNREGA provides a good example of just how lack of quality-monitoring tends to exaggerate administrative achievements. Although DBT for wage payment under MGNREGA may have streamlined administrative processes, the system’s efficacy is not beyond doubt. On one hand, imposition of the DBT system (with some exceptions) in early 2016 placed the cart before the horse by demanding that even the remotest of villages process payments electronically (irrespective of the quality of their internet infrastructure and capacity of local officials). At the same time, official data suggests that the process of transferring money from the governments’ accounts to beneficiaries’ accounts is taking much longer than expected. Official data (as of 23 June 2018), nevertheless, suggests that 20 percent of all dues uploaded for payment processing during 1-16 June 2018 (all of which should have been processed by 23 June) remain unpaid. This may have adversely affected over a quarter of all MGNREGA workers who worked during this period. Notably, owing to India’s agricultural cycle and weather patterns, the months of May and June usually witness the highest demand for MGNREGA work within the year. Delays during this period of increased distress fly in the face of the program’s fundamental spirit. The absence of a coherent counter-narrative has only helped the incumbent government. To some extent, one can blame the lack of credibility within the Opposition, which has resulted in a one-sided communication monopoly for the government. In fact, back in the days of UPA-II, it was not as much the irregularities that the CAG discovered but the astronomical numbers associated with the 2G spectrum sale and coal block allocations that dealt a blow to the government of the day. The Opposition of the day got lucky, for not only did it receive these big numbers to fling at the ruling government, it piggybacked on the claims of an independent authority that was perceived as credible. The very fact that we are critically reviewing the quality of public delivery suggests that on numerous fronts, we have overcome the challenge of scaling up services. That is a fact that one can’t deny. After all, it took only 31 percent of the country’s voters to hand over a decisive mandate to the BJP in 2014. With current political developments, even if that threshold were to rise up by a few percentage points, the   may well be enough. The government need only target the required “critical mass”, which consists of voters who have either benefited from this scale-up or perceive the scale-up to be a big enough achievement in itself.

He’s heading into an election year and there, on a flower-bedecked stage in front of the Karnataka state Assembly, Opposition leaders he thought would never come together held up their arms in a show of unity to sound the bugle for a Modi versus All battle in 2019. The occasion was the swearing-in ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy as chief minister of a JD(S)-Congress government. However, it would be foolhardy to jump to conclusions from one grand show of camaraderie by the Opposition. But for the first time in the four years that the Modi government has been in office, it would seem that the road to 2019 is not a one-way street. If the show of Opposition unity translates into seat pacts on the ground, a contest is very much in the offing and the outcome is anyone’s guess. Modi@4 is a sharp contrast to Modi@3. Last year, at this time, he was riding high, having swept the UP Assembly polls with a record number of seats. However, the past year has not been kind to him. A series of electoral and political setbacks has tarnished the aura of invincibility. Growing unrest in the countryside has left gaping holes in Modi’s shining India story. And financial scandals like diamond merchant Nirav Modi’s flight from India, leaving behind a mountain of debts in a public sector bank, has left Brand Modi looking slightly frayed at the edges. Increasingly, the narrative seems to be slipping out of Modi’s hands. Claims of fast-paced development through figures trotted out by ministers for rural electrification, gas connections and highways have begun to sound hollow in the wake of brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao, an eye-popping farmers’ protest march through the streets of Mumbai, a flyover collapse in Modi’s constituency of Varanasi, controversial police encounters in Yogi Adityanath’s UP and continuing joblessness. In fact, the big development in the past one year has been the manner in which the Congress has mastered the tools of social media to fight the BJP on its own turf. This has undoubtedly helped craft a counter narrative that Modi is finding difficult to challenge in a rapidly deteriorating socio-political environment. It is ironic that today, as election year looms, the BJP is teetering dangerously close to squandering the majority it won so handsomely in 2014. In four years, it has lost nine seats in by-polls, bringing its numbers in the Lok Sabha down to 273. And last week, two of its Karnataka MPs including BS Yeddyurappa, resigned before taking oath as MLAs in the state Assembly. Modi has also lost two major allies, Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and Shiv Sena, which has declared that it will fight the general election on its own. There’s trouble brewing in Bihar as well. What seemed to be a great coup when the BJP reclaimed Nitish Kumar from Lalu Yadav is rapidly turning sour. Smaller partners like Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Khushwaha have teamed up with Nitish to form a ginger group which is giving the BJP a hard time. Also, although it received a huge shock in the Assembly elections in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, the BJP managed to scrape through and stop the Congress from pulling off a major upset. Many analysts feel that despite the setbacks, Modi’s personal appeal is still strong. But his fifth year is going to be tough for him despite his phenomenal communication skills and ability to connect directly with people. Street protests are growing and turning increasingly violent as the marginalised and the dispossessed fight the State for a better deal. Tuticorin, where 12 persons were killed in police firing during the recent protests against big corporate interests, brings back grim reminders of Nandigram which proved to be the last nail in the Left Front’s coffin in Bengal. And Modi still hasn’t come up with a plan of action to implement his biggest 2014 election promise: Job creation. He needs an out-of-the-box idea to regain control of the narrative before it’s too late. If Karnataka is a sign of things to come, the momentum may be shifting to the other side.

Like many far-left liberals, he is also seen indulging in hate-mongering by calling for Amit Shah’s murder. Brazenly attempting to incite the Muslims, the Tamil academician is heard telling the crowd that “he expected but no Muslim doing it”, hinting that he expected that the Muslims in the country would kill Home Minister Amit Shah for implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act, which they have been falsely claiming to be anti-Muslims, but no Muslim has yet killed him. Nellai Kannan said this at a rally by Islamist organisation SDPI. Nellai Kannan has fought elections on a Congress ticket in the past and is largely viewed as a Congress supporting voice. The Islamist outfit PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after merging three fringe Muslim outfits – the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of the Tamil Nadu – to protect “interest of the backward and oppressed people.” In Kerala, most of its leaders were members of the banned Student Islamic Movement of India. Reportedly, the PFI was allegedly involved in at least 24 political murders in Kerala. The Islamist outfits Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and its sister organisation PFI Popular Front of India have been accused of extreme communalism and has a long history of resorting to violence against their political opponents. The PFI is also accused by the National Investigation Agency for being involved in love-jihad cases in Kerala. Recently, the SDPI members were also arrested in connection with the brutal murder of ABVP worker in Kannur. Recently, PFI members were accused of killing 42-year-old activist Ramalingam. The activist was brutally murdered for opposing religious conversion. The accused PFI members have been preaching conversion to Islam. In December, two people, former members of the extremist Islamist organisation, Popular Front of India (PFI) had joined the IS. The police said that K Sajjad and Anwar Poothappara had links with the radical Islamic outfit in the past. The anti-CAA Muslim mob has been on a rampage in various parts of the country since the Citizenship Act was brought in by the Modi government. While several Pakistani Hindu migrants across the country have been celebrating and lauding the passing of the historic Citizenship Amendment Act, which has brought their lost hope back, Muslim mobs had gone on a rampage, destroying public property and creating chaos. In fact, UP DGP OP Singh had said that members of radical Islamic organisations – Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political front, Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), including political parties like Samajwadi Party were involved in instigating Muslim mobs to indulge in violence across the state during the anti-CAA protests. Three people associated with the radical Islamic organisation PFI, including UP state head Waseem, have been arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police for orchestrating violence by spreading misinformation through social media platforms.

He said, ‘Jo apni maa ka nahin hua, Patni ka nahi hua, wo desh ka kya hoga’ (Someone who couldn’t belong to his mother, his wife, how will he belong to the country). In the video shared by Times Now, Ansari assures the crowd he is addressing that the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC will not be implemented in the state. These are empty boasts as state governments do not have any say over matters of citizenship. The Home Ministry had earlier said that they were considering taking the online route in order to bypass state governments. The Congress party has a long history of making the most distasteful remarks about Narendra Modi’s personal life. Last year, the State General Secretary of Rajasthan Mahila Congress targeted the Prime Minister for sharing pictures with the grandaughter of BJP MP Satyanarayan Jatiya who had visited him. She had said, “Modji samay par ghar jaate to aaj doosare ke bachche nahin khilaane padate.” This roughly translates as “Had Modiji settled down on time in life, he would not have to play with other’s kids.” Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh, too, had targeted Narendra Modi’s personal life last year when he accused the Prime Minister of hiding his marital status and educational qualifications. Other opposition leaders haven’t been far behind either.

The two incidents might appear extremely different on the face of it but both of them highlight a very significant problem within Indian society. By any measure, the Faridabad incident and the Munger shooting are indeed absolutely shocking.\n\nWe are living in a culture of denial of the obvious. We have made denial of reality the cornerstone of our worldview. Even though all of us are well aware of the truth, we will go to extraordinary lengths to pretend otherwise during public life. For instance, we are well aware that on the best of days, the Police are perceived as people to be avoided at all costs.\n\nThere are the much vaulted arguments about police reforms. One would expect the number 1 priority on that list would be reforming the culture that has come to dominate our police force but somehow, it is never on the agenda. There needs to be far more accountability for the police and far stricter punishment for dereliction of duty. Most of all, it is necessary for everyone to see that justice is being done.\n\nThere is no point in blaming the Police alone. Our systems work because there are great men and women working in the government, the bureaucracy, the Judiciary and the Police who manage to compensate for the systemic flaws just enough so as to ensure that the edifice could be maintained. The system itself is rotten to the very core.\n\nThe Munger shooting is the most obvious in a series of incidents that reflect the utter moral depravity of the secular state. First of all, the Election Commission of India reserved the 28th of October for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly Elections. Either they were not aware of the specific traditions of Munger or they did not believe they were important enough. In either case, it reflects their remarkable incompetence.\n\nThen, the Police suddenly discovered their bravado while dealing with Hindu devotees. There are different versions of what precisely happened but there are videos that suggest that the Police used brutal force against the devotees when they took out a procession for the Visarjan at around midnight on the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe Police apparently thrashed the devotees which sparked a protest that ultimately led to the death of one and critical injuries for six others. Ideally, the entire team of police officials responsible for the madness should be suspended prior to an investigation and charges related to murder ought to be invoked if some of them are found guilty for the death of the Hindu devotee.\n\nThe brutal murder of the Hindu devotee, and that is what it precisely was, highlights a very salient aspect that has been hitherto ignored. Genuine Police reforms ought to be the concern of every concerned Hindu and reforming the culture of the Police is an extremely Hindu issue. Because ultimately, it is the Hindu masses who suffer the most due to police brutality.\n\nThe Police is too afraid to act against even genuine criminals from minority Abrahamic communities because they are actually scared for their lives. It is the law-abiding Hindus which bear the brunt of their brutality as it is against the weak that the bullies discover their strength all of a sudden. And make no mistake, the ordinary masses of all communities are weak.\n\nSome compensate for it by building tight-knit communities where ‘One for All, All for One’ is the motto. Those communities that fail to do so have to suffer the consequences for their lack of organisation. We cannot afford to live in a culture of denial of the obvious anymore about the actual extent of malfeasance within the Police. And until the Police is reformed, the Hindu masses will continue to suffer and pious devotees will continue to be slaughtered.\n\nImagine the monstrosity of the whole situation. Hindu devotees embark on the annual Visarjan procession and in the way, they are brutalised by the Police and one of them even loses their lives. And yet, after a few days, the same governments which cannot adequately punish and reform the rot that has set in within government institutions will attempt to reform Hindu society itself. It is quite disgraceful.\n\nThe culture of denial is again prominent in the murder of Nikita Tomar in Faridabad. The 21-year old was shot dead in broad daylight by two men outside the Aggarwal college in Ballabgarh. The two accused fled the scene after committing the murder. One of the accused, Taufeeq, appears to have been an obsessive stalker of the girl who murdered her when she refused his advances.\n\nThere is no point in denying here that significant sections of the Muslim community harbour opinions that are radically at odds with the mandate of civil society. Reports have emerged which suggest that the victim was being coerced into converting to Islam and marry the accused which she was resisting. And hence, she was murdered.\n\nInstead of speaking out against this menace, our cultural institutions are busy promoting nonsense such as the Tanishq ad which actually leads to the death of Hindu women. In this particular instance, it was a case of Islamist murder but there have been too many occasions in the past when Muslim boys have lured Hindu women by forging false identities and subsequently murdered them when their actual identity was discovered.\n\nThe two incidents highlight the fact that we cannot afford to live in a culture of denial anymore. It leads to the actual death of ordinary Hindu citizens who want nothing more than to live in peace. The elites might delude themselves by intricate fantasies but the masses do not have the luxury of entertaining such delusions.\n\nUntil we rid ourselves of the culture, ordinary Hindu citizens will continue to be murdered with impunity and without any consequences when all they want to do is participate in the Visarjan of their beloved deity. Until we rid ourselves of the culture, we will continue to have murders like that of Nikita Tomar who had to forfeit her life because she did not wish to marry a psychopath.\n\nBoth these incidents are heart-breaking, to put it mildly. But there are lessons from them that Hindus must learn. Until the appropriate lessons are learnt, such incidents will continue to occur with an obscene frequency. The unfortunate deaths of both Nikita Tomar and the Hindu devotee in Munger should only strengthen our resolve to ensure the reformation that we seek in our institutions and public life.","nationalist":1,"_deepnote_index_column":0},{"content":"In a shocking display of intolerance and bigotry, a group of radical Islamists attacked over 10 Hindu families on Sunday at Korbanpur village under Muradnagar Upazila in the Comilla district of Bangladesh.\n\nAs per reports, the Hindu households were selectively vandalised and later set on fire after a man allegedly expressed solidarity with France and defended the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in Facebook comments.

While addressing at Shri Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkur today the speaks on the government historic decision to impose the newly amended Citizenship Act. Greeting everyone present at the Mutt, he asked the nation to remember how the last decade began. In contrast, he said, the third decade of the 21st Century has started on a strong footing of expectations and aspirations. “This aspiration is to see India as a prosperous, capable and all-encompassing world power. It has now become the psyche of every Indian that the problems we have inherited have to be solved. This message emanating from the society also inspires, encourages our government,” said the PM. Modi slammed Congress and its allies, saying they are against giving relief to those who have been brutalised and victimised in Pakistan. “Pakistan was formed on the basis of religion, religious minorities were being persecuted there. The persecuted were forced to come to India as refugees. But Congress and its allies don’t speak against Pakistan, instead, they are taking out rallies against these refugees,” PM Modi said. Strongly defending the amended Citizenship Act Modi asked anti-CAA protesters rioting at the behest of Congress and other Opposition parties, to raise their voice against Pakistan’s atrocities of the past. To those who are agitating against the Parliament of India, Prime Minister said, “If you have to agitate, raise your voice against the exploits of Pakistan in the last 70 years. Now the need is to expose this action of Pakistan at the international level. If you have to raise slogans, then raise slogans related to the way minorities are being tortured in Pakistan. If you have to take out a procession then take out a procession in support of Hindu-Dalit-victim-exploited from Pakistan”. Our Govt is working tirelessly to solve the problems that have persisted in India for decades. We’re working to ensure that every poor has a house, a gas connection, clean drinking water, healthcare, insurance cover, and every village gets broadband service, said PM Modi addressing the programme at Shri Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkur, Karnataka. Talking about the schemes which had been introduced by the government for farmers, Modi said that the BJP government had done all these keeping in mind the welfare of the agricultural community in India.

While a Tanishq showroom in Gujarat has condemned the ad and apologised to the Hindu community for it, liberals are falling over backwards in justifying it. Perhaps the most clownish ‘hot take’ came from senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor who decided to pounce upon the occasion to peddle his personal delusions.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, we would ignore such comments as the mad ramblings of a con-artist who has long passed his sell-by date but since the opinion has been voiced by an individuals who ‘larps’ as an intellectual, it deserves a response.\n\nShashi Tharoor remarked on Tuesday, “If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them (‘Hindutva bigots’) so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” This is a preposterous claim. A country that lost huge portions of its territory to Islamic terrorism only seventy-three years ago cannot be the longest surviving symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ by default.\n\nSo Hindutva bigots have called for a boycott of ⁦@TanishqJewelry⁩ for highlighting Hindu-Muslim unity through this beautiful ad. If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India? pic.twitter.com/cV0LpWzjda\n\n— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) October 13, 2020\nEven after an event as cataclysmic and traumatic as the partition of 1947, if certain individuals wish to propagate India as a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, then they are deluding themselves. It is also evident in everyday discourse that India is not the symbol Shashi Tharoor and members of his party wish it to be.\n\nThe events since 2019 have cemented these facts and have left no room for doubt. The response to the abrogation of Article 370, the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Ram Mandir verdict highlighted the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two communities in excruciating detail.\n\nWhile ‘secular’ intellectuals and politicians prefer to sing paeans to ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, it is an undeniable fact that the only Muslim majority state in the country refused to join the Indian mainstream and clung on to Article 370 that essentially provided for an Islamic state within Indian territory. When the article was abrogated, the Congress party and Muslim-oriented parties opposed it tooth and nail.\n\nWith regards to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Indian Muslims wanted the descendants of those who created Pakistan to have the same privileges as the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist populations of the Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan towards whom India has a sacred commitment. The Act witnessed great protests and eventually culminated with communal riots in Delhi.\n\nThe same could be observed in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi. Much violence and bloodshed could have been avoided if the Muslim community had chosen to respect the special attachment that Hindus have towards the birthplace of Rama. But they refused to, they fought until the very end for a Masjid built by an Islamic tyrant after demolishing a Hindu Temple.\n\nThus, we see that the much exalted ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ that charlatans such as Shashi Tharoor evaporates into thin air on every major contentious issue. ‘Evaporates into thin air’ is perhaps the wrong phrase to use here since such a unity never existed in the first place. And these are only three of the most contentious issues in recent times.\n\nThere are other long-standing issues such as cow smuggling and consumption of beef where there is no consensus between the two communities. Things escalated to such a degree that members of Youth Congress slaughtered a calf in broad daylight in Kerala and consumed its meat. That the leader of such a party claims that India is a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ is indeed a disgrace.\n\nHaving said that, it is true that India is a symbol of a greater ideal. There is an idea at the core of the Republic of India, unfortunately enough, it is an idea that is reviled by men and women of a secular bent. However, it cannot be denied that India is the manifestation of the Hindu Civilization in the Age of Modernity and it is the custodian of the great civilization. It is India’s sacred duty to serve and protect our Hindu Civilization.\n\nThus, India is not a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ but evidence of the superiority of Hinduism itself. India is the only country that is home to a heterogenous polytheistic culture. For Indians, the multiplicity of the Divine is not a theoretical proposition but a lived reality. There is no other country in the world where its citizenry worships a multitude of Gods and Goddesses, with their own unique strands of traditions and ritualistic obeisance, with equal fervour.\n\nMaa Durga, Shri Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Maheshwara, Swami Ayyappa, Ganapati, Kartikeya, Lakshmi, Saraswati, there is a plethora of Gods in the Hindu pantheon and we worship the many. A wise man once remarked that polytheism is the highest expression of human consciousness and it is only in India that it finds its true expression in the 21st century. India is the cradle of civilization that has shaped and continues to shape the destinies of multiple nations. And it is so because of Hinduism and Hinduism alone.\n\nThus, secular politicians may want us to bend over backwards to accommodate their perverse fantasies but their misguided notions shall find place in our country no more. Hinduism is India’s destiny and it is Hinduism that defines India at the international order. There is no need for us to be apologetic about India’s Hindu identity; we are living in an age of Hindu assertiveness after all. Shashi Tharoor may be uncomfortable with the idea but it is one that he will have to live with.\n\nFor it is the invisible threads of Dharma that holds our country together. Peoples from different cultural, linguistic, regional backgrounds with their own unique traditions and culture lend their allegiance to India not because of fancy ideals enshrined in our Constitution. They do so because such diverse peoples are held together by the strands of Hinduism that is not always visible but always felt nonetheless.\n\nOnly Hinduism could ever hope to hold such a diverse country together. And there in lies its inherent superiority. Thus, India’s destiny and Hinduism’s are intertwined inseparably and it is one that will last till eternity.

The said exhibition or memorial will be the first of its kind in this direction,” the official statement by the organisers as quoted by ANI said.\n\nThe official statement also added that it is important to present such a historic narrative to the people in order to have a dialogue with them. It sought to clear hazy sense of history some people in Kashmir had, especially with regards to Pakistan’s claim on the territory. The statement said that people should be aware of the challenges faced by the nation just months after securing independence.\n\n\nBillboard informing J&K residents about invasion of Kashmir by Pakistani militias on October 22, 1947(Black Day)\n“Pakistan invaded Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947, and brought in its wake horrifying mass plunder and vandalism. Thousands of men, women and children were mercilessly slaughtered by the intruders. Four days later, on October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession, merging his state with India. Following the accession of the state to India, Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar, the state capital to repel the tribal invasion,” the statement noted.\n\nPakistan Army launched ‘Operation Gulmarg’ to snatch Jammu and Kashmir\nSoon after the partition, the Pakistani leadership, both civilian and military, was desperate and determined to expand its territorial area. Several attempts were made by Pakistani leaders, including Mohammad Ali Jinnah to convince Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir to accede to Pakistan. However, Singh had remained adamant on his demand to have an independent princely state.\n\nSoon after the independence, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called ‘Operation Gulmarg‘ and put it into action. According to the plan, 20 Lashkars (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribals, were to recruited from various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. The armed Lashkars were expected to reach their launching point in Abbottabad on October 18, and subsequently cross into Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947. The primary objective of the Operation was to capture Srinagar by October 26, 1947.\n\nThe 20 Lashkars were to be divided into a group of 2—10 militia tribes were expected to attack the Kashmir Valley through Muzaffarabad and the remaining ten were expected to join the rebels in Poonch, Rawalkot and Bhimber from where they were to advance to Jammu.\n\nBLACK DAY\n\nOn this day, Lashkars armed with axes, swords & guns backed by #Pakistan Army attacked Jammu & Kashmir.

Akbar Khan, who was entrusted with the operation, devised a plan to make the Kashmir rebellion appear like a revolt waged by the people of Jammu and Kashmir against their non-Muslim rulers. The aim here was to take the cover of civilian unrest for the impending military action. Through a concerted attempt, rebellion against Maharaja Hari Singh was ginned up and rebels were encouraged to take up arms against the Hindu ruler.\n\nAs a prelude to this plan, Pakistan stopped the supply of essential goods like petrol, oil, food, sugar, salt etc. to Jammu and Kashmir, effectively blockading the state and thereby actively stoking rebellion against Maharaja Hari Singh.\n\nPakistani Pashtun tribal militias and Pakistani Army regulars invade Jammu and Kashmir\nThe weeks of planning and illicit manoeuvrings under Operation Gulmarg culminated into the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir which marked the commencement of the events that led to the first Indo-Pak war. In the wee hours of October 22, 1947, scores of Pakistani Pashtun tribal militias, in connivance with the Pakistani state and army surreptitiously crossed the border from Garhi Habibullah into Jammu and Kashmir and attacked the town of Muzaffarabad.\n\nSeveral accounts claim that the tribal raiders, raised by the Pakistani Army, were aided by the traitors of the 4 KI guarding the outposts at Lohar Gali and Ramkot. Many Muslim forces tasked with protecting the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir mutinied and colluded with the rampaging Pashtun tribesmen to defeat the forces deployed by Maharaja Hari Singh.\n\nThese rebels provided crucial information to the armed raiders about the troop deployment and position and helped them prevail over them. Even before the sleeping residents of Muzaffarabad could realise, the town was already under the control of invading Pashtun militias. Documented accounts state that hundreds of women were raped and abducted, houses looted and men slaughtered on the streets.\n\nAfter wreaking havoc in Muzaffarabad, the Pashtuns marched towards the prosperous town of Baramulla, even though the path to Srinagar was clear. Here too, the Pashtuns killed innumerable men and women, looted houses and then set them on fire. Out of 14,000 population at the time, less than two thousand had remained. Most of them were either killed in the Pashtun onslaught or fled the village for safer places.\n\nThe ‘Lashkars’ wreaked havoc, killed, raped and looted Hindus and Muslims alike\nThe invading tribal groups had no regard for anyone. They ran riot, leaving chaos, destruction and killings in their wake. They even raped nuns, who were performing their duties at St. Joseph Hospital and schools in Baramulla. Even doctors, paramedics, and nurses tending to the sick and incapacitated were not spared. They were, too, subjected to a brutal assault by the invading tribesmen.\n\nAs Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani regular army soldiers were busy looting Kashmiris in Baramulla, defiling their women and vandalising the properties, Maharaja Hari Singh sought an intervention from India to stop the devastation, which was contingent upon his signing of Instrument of Accession.\n\nAfter Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India on October 26, 1947, the Indian Armed forces were airlifted to the Kashmir Valley the next day. The Army launched an aggressive offence against the rampaging Pashtuns and stopped their march towards Srinagar. In the subsequent months, the Indian Army purged the state of the Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani regulars and forced them to retreat to what is present-day Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.\n\nFor years, Pakistan perpetuated the myth that tribal raiders were liberators who had come to Kashmir to fulfil their religious obligation of jihad and avenge the deaths of Muslims killed in the communal riots in Jammu. However, in reality, the tribesmen were not carrying out any religious war or jihad. They were there to brazenly trample upon the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir, rape and dishonour the women, plunder and pillage Kashmiri, regardless of their religion.\n\nThey were aided, provided and instigated by the regulars in the Pakistani army. Whose motive, to this day, remains to add the region of Jammu and Kashmir to the territory of Pakistan and push India’s northern border further down.","nationalist":1,"_deepnote_index_column":2},{"content":"Ever since the abrogation of Article 370, the pro-Islamist lobby has been gunning for Prime Minister Modi with the most despicable lies and propaganda. Several pro-Islamist Indian journalists took it upon themselves to defame India internationally, while others, habitually peddle lies through proxy websites and social media to tarnish the image of India after the Modi government decided to abrogate Article 370 and finally, fully integrate the new Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India. The pro-Islamist lobby has now found a new way to hit-out at PM Modi, albeit, with lies and deceit. In the parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Modi hit out at Kashmir politicians like Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti for their threats prior to the abrogation of Article 370. Prime Minister Modi in parliament first quoted Mehbooba Mufti. Read: Jammu and Kashmir: NC’s Omar Abdullah and PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti booked under Public Safety Act PM Modi quoted a tweetstorm by Mehmooba Mufti on the 5th of August, the day Article 370 was abrogated. Specifically, PM Modi referred to this tweet where Mehbooba Mufti had questioned what Kashmir got for “choosing India.” Then, PM Modi referred to Omar Abdullah and said Omar had said, “आर्टिकल 370 को हटाना ऐसा भूकंप लाएगा की कश्मीर भारत से अलग हो जायेगा (The abrogation of Article 370 would bring a massive earthquake that it will divide Kashmir from India.)”. Before we get into how the propagandists are now trying to twist PM Modi’s words, one must understand the context in which PM Modi was speaking. First, PM Modi spoke at length about the development that has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. He then spoke about how there are charges that the Abrogation of Article 370 was against the tenets of the Constitution of India. It was then that PM Modi quoted Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah to explain how it was their statements that were against the very tenets of the Constitution and the territorial integrity of India. Read: AltNews’ Pratik Sinha helps New Yorker water down Pulwama attack, cast aspersions that Balakot airstrike was fabricated To understand this better, here are parts of what Mehbooba Mufti had said after the abrogation of Article 370. “Decision of J&K leadership to reject 2 nation theory in 1947 & align with India has backfired. Unilateral decision of GOI to scrap Article 370 is illegal & unconstitutional which will make India an occupational force in J&K. GOIs intentions are clear. They want the territory of J&K by terrorising it’s people. Those elements in J&K who rejected the constitution & sought resolution under the UN have been vindicated. GOIs intention is clear & sinister. They want to change the demography of the only Muslim majority state in India, disempower Muslims to the extent where they become second class citizens in their own state. What did J&K get for acceding to India? Another partition along communal lines? Our special status isn’t a gift bestowed upon us. Its a right guaranteed by the same parliament. A contract entered into by J&K leadership & India. Today the very same contract has been violated (sic).” Further, Omar Abdullah had said that this decision will have ‘dangerous consequences’ almost threatening the Union of India. To understand what he meant by these threats, one must look at Omar Abdullah’s 2014 tweet-storm where he had elucidated exactly what these ‘consequences’ were. Essentially, both Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti had spoken about breaking India up, inciting violence and supporting terrorists and separatists of Kashmir if Article 370 was abrogated. In fact, after being put under house arrest, Omar Abdullah had also raised questions on Kashmir acceding to India and said that the accession was based on Article 370, essentially hinting that now that Article 370 has been abrogated, there is no reason for Kashmir to be a part of India. In fact, Omar Abdullah’s statement post the abrogation of Article 370 and those of Rahul Gandhi, whose party is today shielding Omar Abdullah from the statements of PM Modi were quoted by Pakistan in their anti-India dossier to UNHRC. Now that these problematic and dangerous statements were mentioned by PM Modi in the parliament itself after time had wiped them clean from public memory, the lobby had to find a way to save face, as they always do, when Islamists are exposed. The Lutyens cabal then focussed on one word that was used by the Prime Minister as a ‘matter of speech’, in order to whitewash the threats issued by the Kashmir leaders only points to a deeper malaise within the Lutyens ecosystem. Several propagandists took to Twitter to claim that PM Modi was lying and that he had, in fact, quoted a satire website Faking News and passed the word ‘Earthquake’ as an authentic quote by Omar Abdullah. The trope was started by propagandists like Swati Chaturvedi and to help the narrative reach further, self-proclaimed fact-checkers like AltNews who have been caught peddling lies often also chimed in along with Congress and other usual suspects. What the propagandists were trying to do is shield Islamist leaders from Kashmir like Omar Abdullah and latch on to one word, while hiding the truly seditious statements that Abdullah and Mufti had given after the abrogation of Article 370. The chorus would have been funny if not tragic. ‘will cause earthquakes’ is a popular figure of speech and even their favourite Rahul Gandhi had used it. PM Modi simply paraphrased it. Just that it happened to have been used on Faking News too, doesn’t mean he quoted Faking News. Basically, PM Modi used a figure of speech to paraphrase whatever was said by the Kashmir politicians. While the manner in which PM Modi paraphrased Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti did not alter the meaning of their sentiment, the same cannot be said about the cabal. In fact, paraphrasing and interpreting wrongly the meaning of PM Modi says has been the favourite strawman tactic used by the cabal for a long time with the media happily playing along, just as it is now. Going back to point from where the vilification of Prime Minister Modi started – The Gujarat riots of 2002. Times of India had reported that speaking about the riots, PM Modi had said that ‘every action has a reaction’, essentially meaning that the burning of Hindus has been answered with the riots. However, Modi had never said this. After TOI reported this blatant lie, several op-eds by media foot soldiers were written demonising Modi. Later, in 2013, before the 2014 General Elections, media had misquoted Modi yet again. They reported that Modi had compared Muslims to dogs by saying that even if a dog died, he would have felt bad. In reality, it was again only a metaphor used. Modi had essentially said that we are human beings who feel bad even if an animal dies, the Muslims and Hindus who died were human beings and he is pained by their death. The most recent was PM Modi’s “15 Lac” comment during the run-up to 2014 elections. PM Modi had said, to quantify the amount of black money stashed abroad that if we ever got all the black money back to India, there was so much, that every person could get 15 Lac out of it. That statement was twisted to report that PM Modi had promised the people of India that he would credit Rs 15 Lac to every citizen’s account. The politicians used that to call Modi a liar and the media simply played along, throwing every ethic of journalism to the wind. This is just the tip of the iceberg in the saga of how politicians and their pens for hire have misquoted and maligned PM Modi ever since his Gujarat days, that how ‘project vilify Modi’ is still very much in progress. One has to wonder why the lobby is so desperate at this point in time. Perhaps because with the anti-CAA riots and Muslim mobs wreaking havoc, the carefully crafted narrative of how the only problem that ails India is that of “Hindutva” is falling apart, or because of Shaheen Bagh and how the media aided the Islamists there have exposed the true face of the cabal. Either way, the desperation of the pro-Islamist lobby is rather evident if they had to cling on to such strawman arguments to vilify the Prime Minister.","nationalist":1,"_deepnote_index_column":35}],"rows_bottom":null},"text/plain":"                                                 content  nationalist\n8341   Senior NDPP leader Neiphiu Rio

Saturday, the radical Islamist organisation, the Popular Front of India (PFI) came out in support of the AAP leader Tahir Hussain and claimed that he had been a victim of “vicious politics”. The PFI has squarely blamed the Centre for the violence in Delhi and also hit out at the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for suspending Tahir Hussain.\n\nThe role of Aam Aadmi Party leader Tahir Hussain in the brutal murder of Intelligence Bureau (IB) employee Ankit Sharma and also inciting riots in the Delhi has now been under scanner.\n\nEyewitness accounts have revealed that Ankit Sharma was lynched to death by a Muslim mob. Journalist Rahul Pandita managed to get hold of multiple eyewitnesses who saw the young officer being dragged inside Tahir Hussain’s house by an enraged mob before his dead body was found lying in a drain.\n\nThe unruly Muslim mob perched on the top of Hussain’s building wildly flung bricks and petrol bombs at the opposite street, in order to attack a Shiv temple located there. A building adjoining to the temple was burnt down by the rampaging mob. The incessant attack on the temple structure had rendered the entire edifice rickety and tottering, on the verge of collapse. Following the riots, media teams that had visited Tahir Hussain’s house had found stones and bricks, petrol bombs, acid packs etc lying on the roof.\n\nNow, another horrific tale of the Muslim brutality inflicted upon the Hindus from Tahir Hussain’s bungalow has come to the fore. Muslims who lived for years intertwined with Hindu families in Moonga Nagar suddenly started baying for their blood. In one such incident, Muslim residents of the region did not even spare a wedding house whose Hindu women used to address neighbourhood Muslim men as “Bhaijaan” and greet them with a “salam”.\n\nTahir Hussain has gone missing soon after the FIR was registered against him for his direct involvement in the murder of Ankit Sharma, on the complaint of Ankit’s family. The Delhi police had filed a case against the AAP leader under Section 302(a) Murder, in the Dayalpur police station of Delhi.\n\nNevertheless, the usual suspects came to his defence to absolve him of any wrongdoing. AAP social media head Ankit Lal shared a video wherein Tahir Hussain claimed that he was rescued by the cops after his house came under seize on February 24. Netizens were quick to point out a February 25 video wherein he was seen wearing the same dress and holding a stick in hand. ‘Eminent intellectual’ Javed Akhtar concluded that the religious identity of Tahir Hussain might have been a factor in the police crackdown against him.\n\nEarlier, a report of UP State Intelligence has revealed the role of Bhim Army and PFI in orchestrating simultaneous violence in Aligarh and Delhi.","count":2},{"name":"The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on a plea by historian Romila Thapar and others seeking the immediate release of five rights activists in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence case and an Special Investigation Team probe into their arrest.

It also asked the parties to file their written submissions by then. The five activists – Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha – are under arrest at their respective homes since August 29. The plea by Thapar and economists Prabhat Patnaik and Devaki Jain, sociology professor Satish Deshpande and human rights lawyer Maja Daruwala has sought an independent probe into the arrests and the immediate release of the five activists. The Maharashtra police had arrested the rights activists on August 28 in connection with an FIR lodged following a conclave, Elgar Parishad, held on December 31 last year. The apex court had said on September 19 that it would look into the case with a hawk’s eye as liberty cannot be “sacrificed at the altar of conjectures”. It had told the Maharashtra government that there should be a clear-cut distinction between opposition and dissent on one hand and attempts to create disturbance, law and order problems or overthrow the government on the other. Senior advocates Anand Grover, Ashwini Kumar and Prashant Bhushan also alleged that the entire case was cooked up and adequate safeguards should be provided to protect the liberty of five activists. The apex court had earlier said that it may order an SIT probe if it found that the evidence has been “cooked up”.","count":1},{"name":"76

Bavaliya dumping the Congress to join the BJP is a strategic move by the latter in terms of region and caste politics in the state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls which is the home turf of both the Prime Minister   and BJP's national president  . The development was predictable following the series of events that had been taking place over the last few months. It was swift political action on Tuesday over a few hours that saw Bavaliya resigning from the Congress and as Jasdan MLA, driving to the BJP office for being inducted into the saffron party and thereafter being administered oath as a member of Chief Minister' Vijay Rupani's team of ministers. Through his poaching the BJP would be looking at three major things. The first is to have a credible leader in the all important Saurashtra region. The second to make inroads into the Other Backward Castes (OBC) voter support base while balancing caste equations within the party and third making up for losses in the rural areas. These factors need to be analyzed one by one. The BJP had witnessed a major rout in the Saurashtra region in the 2017 Assembly polls. This region sends 58 of the 182 members of the state assembly. The BJP's tally had come down considerably from 35 to 23 in the recent polls and the party had been routed in the rural areas on issues due to farmers' unrest and the voters' caste combination that voted against the party. “Bavaliya is one of the most experienced political faces from Saurashtra. A four time MLA and one time MP, he comes from the all important Koli community among the OBCs. The OBCs account for more than 45 per cent of the total electorate. The Kolis that are referred to Thakors in other parts of Gujarat account for roughly half the total OBC population. This surely makes him a prize catch,” said a political observer. He further pointed that the Koli community lacks in education and is known to vote for candidates on their community irrespective of the party he is representing. “Bavaliya's reputation is also good among the people. A teacher who is polite and easily accessible with total connect with the ground realities makes him popular in the rural areas,” he said. Another interesting fact is that by inducting Bavaliya, the BJP leadership can now deal more effectively with its other Koli strongman Parshottam Solanki along with his brother Hira Solanki. Parshottam has been throwing tantrums seeking elevation from a minister of state to cabinet rank. Despite being assured that his concerns would be addressed he is known to remain absent from important meetings. Hira had recently lost the assembly poll from Rajula seat but his representing the powerful Koli community ensured that he was inducted in the poll management committee of the BJP for the Lok Sabha elections.. With Bavaliya expected to take a centrestage among the Koli community, the Solanki brothers would not be able to throw their weight around like before. But many are skeptical whether Bavaliya would be able to give electoral dividends to the BJP in the coming polls. Sources say that many of his supporters were not keen on his joining the BJP at this point of time and had instead wanted him to bargain for a better deal within the Congress. These supporters are of the view that the Congress leaders who had joined the BJP in the past have got a raw deal. They say that heavyweights like Narhari Amin have gone into oblivion and those who were given tickets lost the polls. They have also pointed that the anger against the BJP still persists in rural Saurashtra. It needs to be pointed that the build up for Bavaliya's departure from the Congress was underway for the last several months. He was initially peeved at not being made the leader of the Opposition and the party president   choosing the much younger Paresh Dhanani for the post. He was also sidelined for the post of the state Congress chief that eventually went to Amit Chavda. His rivalry with Indranil Rajyaguru, the Congress leader from Rajkot had also been making headlines. Rajyaguru too tendered his resignation from the party last week which is yet to be accepted. An agitated Bavaliya had met Rahul Gandhi some days back. Sources say that he was offered a greater role in the organisation at the central level which was not acceptable to him. He had come back and had held a meeting with his supporters at Jasdan where the latter asked him to 'think differently'. Observers say that the BJP will intensify its moves to get more disgruntled Congress leaders on board ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. It had won all the 26 parliamentary seats in the state in 2014. he Congress came up with a spirited performance in the recent assembly polls. The question now is whether the grand old party will manage to keep its flock together. If yes, then what has it got to offer to its disgruntled leaders. A visit by Rahul Gandhi is on the cards soon. It remains to be seen what he has in mind to stem the slide.  ","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.09375,"negativity":0.038,"modiCount":3,"bjpCount":12,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":2},{"content":"The whispers have started: “If not Narendra Modi, then who?” Columnists have started warning us that if we fail to elect Narendra Modi back to power with an absolute majority, we could be in for a spell of “ ”. Should this alarm us? Not quite. On the contrary, if the  in 2019, it will be a great moment for our democracy. A government that has little to show in terms of concrete achievements, and one that pulled every trick in the book to damage constitutional values does not deserve a second chance. This is not a prediction, but an argument.   It is time to revisit the basic fallacies in the Modi story. The Modi story was one manufactured as much by the electronic media, as by the \"enthusiastic cadre\" of the party working tirelessly on the ground and on social media. It should have been amply clear to anyone who really cared that what Narendra Modi really offered was essentially a xenophobic vision for India, garnished by tokenistic sound bites on development and Mahatma Gandhi. Positioning the debate in 2014 as one between a state-led model of development through entitlements and private sector-led model of fast growth has been laid bare for everyone to see. First of all, there are sectors where the state’s presence is non-negotiable, such as social safety nets, basic health and elementary education. In these sectors, an unwilling state has dragged its feet on both policy-making and implementation, with disastrous results. Meanwhile, the state has expanded its reach to hitherto unparalleled levels through Aadhaar. Individual liberty has been curbed on several fronts. “Minimum government” is a joke. With  , GSPC and  , no one should harbour any illusions any longer of Narendra Modi being above corruption. This should have never been a surprise, given that in the much-hyped \"Gujarat model\", extractive private-enterprises were promoted at the expense of people and the environment. But this, along with the blatant use of social media to promote false propaganda both on the economy and society, belies any claims that one may make of the BJP being a mascot of \"good governance\". In the five years that this government would have been in power, we would have regressed on all fronts while the fruits of this power have been accumulated by the RSS and its affiliates. In the past four years, the economy has been run to the ground, and if things don’t look as bad as they might have, we have only low oil prices to thank. This should worry even those who couldn’t care less about the current establishment’s insidious social and cultural agenda. No wonder then, the scare-mongering has started. India apparently doesn’t deserve a coalition government. Those that argue this are basically claiming that a country as diverse as ours deserves a homogenous single-narrative government. Bizarrely, supporters of the current government are loathe to even acknowledge the successes of the previous BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The prime minister’s own intemperate remarks recently in Parliament have left no one in doubt that the ruling party is desperate. While economic performance tends to be cyclical, the vicious campaign of hate and the normalisation of violence seen in the past four years have no parallel. That this cannot take place without active sanction of the state is a foregone conclusion. What the government has attempted to do is to cultivate a level of plausible deniability around the actions that it silently patronises. Thus, we see to this day, the government accepts no responsibility for the actions of its ideological affiliates, instead terming them as the \"irresponsible fringe\". This remains a handy polarisation tool, one can make an appearance prior to every election of any significance. It is also important ask now - what have we lost in this era of a dominant one-party rule at the Centre? Did we get a \"strong\" government? The hallmark of this government running with an absolute majority in Parliament has been the deification of a single leader. An authoritarian leader may harbour fantasies of being a saviour of 1.3 billion people - but as we have witnessed so far, this is as unreal as it can get. This is also why the prime minister has been heard falling back on state governments and previous central governments to share the blame for big and painful reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax. No democracy needs an almighty leader, and contrary to hype, this has not yielded sound far-sighted economic policy. On the other hand, it has exposed the pitfalls of empowering a narrow power structure that is unwilling to seek out credible counsel. It has also revealed for all to see, the danger of bringing leaders to power whose hunger for political power and self-aggrandisement is all-consuming, even at the expense of core constitutional institutions. Worst of all, the embodiment of communalism in the top leadership (and the wider RSS-sponsored eco-system) has inspired many an act of violence and terrorism. Is this the absolute majority dividend we ought to be grateful for? Would a coalition government have done better? It is obviously hard to tell, but competing pressures from coalition constituents would have put a lid on the brazenness that we have seen playing out in public life. Also, a \"strong government\" is one that secures a wide consensus and represents all sections of the population. The general elections of 2019 would be the time to demand accountability. India deserves better, and we should not let ourselves be distracted by alarmists who are raising the bogey of unsettled coalition politics.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.102,"negativity":0.132,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":1,"rssCount":1,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":3},{"content":"Going into the last full Union Budget of his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not only bet on the farmers, but bet the farm on his rural voters. Articulating his vision for the general election of 2019 quite clearly, he has recognised the existence of rural distress, amplified by a string of farmer protests and suicides last year provoked by falling commodity prices and increasing debt. Hoping to deliver on his promise to double farmers’ incomes by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, the Budget has shown every intention of boosting farmers’ incomes by raising the minimum support price for crops to 1.5x the cost of production, liberalising export of agri-commodities, and modernising agricultural markets. This comes in the wake of agri-GDP registering an insipid average annual growth rate of 2 per cent in the first three years of the Modi government - in the last three years of the UPA rule, it was nearly twice this figure. The second clear narrative in Modi Vision 2019 is the creation of jobs. The Budget has seen a push to small businesses, which were badly hit both by demonetisation and the initial implementation of GST. The corporate tax reduction for firms with turnovers below Rs 250 crore as well as Rs 3,794 crore in credit support to MSMEs could help. The continuing push to infrastructure, with expected investments in excess of Rs 50 lakh crore in roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways, is also of a piece with this strong effort - unemployment emerged as the biggest concern among respondents to the India Today Mood of the Nation Poll last week, along with rising prices. Equally clear is the government’s belated recognition of the importance of healthcare and education. As Amartya Sen says, no developed country in the world has progressed without investing in these key areas. On education, the Budget has announced Eklavya schools for tribals as well as 24 new medical colleges and 1,000 new fellowships for doctoral students. In healthcare, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced an ambitious National Health Protection Scheme, which will provide up to Rs 5 lakh per year to 100 million families for secondary and tertiary healthcare. Impressive as this sounds, I am not sure the mechanisms or details of funding have been worked out. The expense could be monumental. There is a disconcertingly familiar sense of too many announcements and too little implementation. Take the example of the Smart Cities Mission, announced in 2015, which aimed at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-the-art amenities. So far, 99 cities have been selected with an outlay of Rs 2.04 lakh crore. But projects worth a mere Rs 2,350 crore have been completed. The rest remain \"in progress\". That’s a pathetic strike rate, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the government’s ability to deliver. Given the additional spending, meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019 will require disinvestment and the highest ever gross taxes as a percentage of GDP. It is a tough ask, according to Crisil chief economist Dharmakirti Joshi, one of the eminent economists in our panel of commentators, but not entirely unachievable. The Budget has nothing for the middle class and large corporates, who in many ways are the bulwark of the economy. The big question is, whether all this will be enough - especially given that the GDP growth rate is expected to fall to 6.75 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to 7.1 the previous year. So far, the economic environment was conducive, but now oil prices have crossed $70 a barrel internationally, and retail inflation has breached the RBI’s target, hitting 5.21 per cent in December. Also, there is nothing to spur the investment rate which has fallen from a peak of nearly 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 26.4 per cent in 2017-18. Unless the government is able to move the needle on this, it is difficult to imagine the accelera­tion in economic growth so necessary to finance its ambitious schemes. My own nagging concern is an old one: I am not sure how much of government expenditure actually reaches the intended beneficiary. In 1985, on a visit to drought-affected Kalahandi in Odisha, the late Rajiv Gandhi said that of every rupee spent by the government, only 15 paise reached the intended recipient. Has that leaky bucket been fixed? If not, the electoral benefits this government is hoping  for after this Budget may not materialise. Elections are not won on grand announcements or manifestos, but on real development on the ground which people can feel.

The manifesto — 'Vision Document Tripura 2018' — said Special Economic Zones (SEZs) would be set up in the state for sectors like food processing, bamboo, IT and textiles. It promised employment to every household, free education for women till graduation, 7th pay commission salary to state government employees and free smartphones to youth. Jaitley said Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants the country to develop, which is why the BJP in Tripura has focused more on development issues in its vision document. He said one degree college would be set up in each constituency of the state to upgrade the education system. The senior BJP leader also announced that adequate number of multi-speciality hospitals and an AIIMS-like hospital would be set up in the state. Tripura would be made a logistic hub for transportation in the entire northeastern region due to its proximity with Bangladesh and the ports in that country, Jaitley said.

According to  , Tytler left the stage and joined the public, while Kumar left the venue altogether. Tytler and Kumar have been accused of instigating the 1984 anti-Sikh riots following the assassination of then-prime minister Indira Gandhi. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reacted strongly to the presence of Tytler and Kumar at the rally, with Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal calling it a joke. Many regular Twitter users too took jibes at Congress: A Delhi BJP leader Harish Khurana claimed that Congress leaders were earlier on Monday seen eating at restaurant in the city before sitting on a protest and observing fast at Rajghat. The leader took to Twitter to post a photo of the same. Congress leader AS Lovely hit back at the BJP, saying that the photograph was from before 8 am and that the symbolic fast was from 10:30 am. Gandhi is set to lead the protest at the Raj Ghat as part of a nationwide \"fast\" of the party to protest against the Narendra Modi government’s complicity in rising violence against minorities. Congress workers will hold a day-long fast at all state and district headquarters to protest against the BJP government and to promote communal harmony and peace across the country. Gandhi will sit with Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken and party workers to protest against the government and its failure to hold discussion in Parliament on key issues such as the CBSE paper leak, the multi-crore PNB scam, Cauvery issue and Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh.

While the \"man behind the machine\" is important, there comes a stage where the superiority of warfighting implements overcomes the prowess of a warrior. We have witnessed that when the bow and arrow overcame the mightiest of land warriors only to be overcome itself by the lance; the bow, lance, sword, shield et al were steamrolled when gun powder came on the scene. And so has been the story over centuries leading to tanks, submarines and now air power, whose instruments have become deciding factors in winning battles and affecting the way war progresses. Adverse technological asymmetry has been fatal down history; India is in the dangerous position of getting on the wrong side of the tech asymmetry curve vis-a-vis its neighbours, especially China — this should be lighting up red bulbs in South Block. The Chinese military-industrial complex has matured to a point where it has become the world’s third largest major arms exporter. Though this is especially true in the field of air defence systems, UAVs and mid-capability fighter and transport aircraft. While the J-20 stealth aircraft has been inducted (production rate being ramped to 36 aircraft per year) and is going through its operational paces, there are reports that the J-31 is being converted to become a carrier borne stealth fighter. This would affect Indian naval power adversely as there are no reports of a corresponding development for the Indian Navy, which is still debating after the shelving of the Naval Tejas programme, whether to get more trouble prone MiG-29K for the indigenous aircraft carrier or some other foreign aircraft. The Chinese have produced the sixth Y-20 Very Heavy Transport Aircraft which will become the mainstay of long range airlift as well as the base aircraft for AWACS and inflight refuelling. They have tied up with the Russians for making a new Advanced Heavy Lift helicopter for the Tibetan plateau and have bought from Ukraine, lock stock and barrel, rights to the world’s biggest transport aircraft, the An-225. The massive airlift capability that will accrue to the PLA can well be imagined! Secure communications, that are so vital in war, will become their forte with research being done in quantum technology. Similar advancements are happening in the land and naval armament arena but the advantage that India presently has with its superior aircraft and aircrew over its Northern frontiers may be slowly slipping away. Air power assets do not come cheap and it is necessary that a nation, vying for a seat at the table of the powerful, commits enough monies towards their acquisition. While the depleting squadron strength of the IAF is being regularly debated, it is the other equally vital aspects too that merit government’s attention. We have only three AWACS and six Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) and no additional ones on the horizon. This writer is witness to the selection of a new FRA in 2009, but the proposal was shot down on \"high\" costs. The reshoot of the project met a similar fate five years hence and now we have floated another tender last week! Will this be cheaper now? No way! Reports from HAL about the ramping up of Tejas are not encouraging and prototype testing of the Tejas Mk1A, eighty-three of which will be bought, is some distance away. The Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft seems a mirage while the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft project is still on the drawing board. The real silver lining is the transport aircraft and helicopter fleets of the IAF that constitute a very potent airlift capability, but these aircraft too are all imported – hopefully, their maintenance contracts are being addressed in time to have adequate availability on the flight line. A healthy combat-ready flight line demonstrates the deterrence that air power affords a nation. The forthcoming national budget is awaited with great anticipation by the armed forces. Technological asymmetry should not be allowed to handicap our first-rate war fighters. : The Economic Survey for 2017-18 brings out the startling fact that India spends only 0.7 per cent of its GDP on Research & Development while China spends 2.1 per cent, the US 2.8 per cent and Israel 4.3 per cent. If the R&D spend is worked out in monetary terms the huge difference between China and India would be abundantly clear as Beijing’s GDP is five times India’s. It is a no-brainer that this is a clear indicator of the fact that technological asymmetry would only increase unless some radical steps are urgently taken by the government to ameliorate the imbalance.

Addressing a Congress workers' rally in Mumbai, Gandhi also targeted the Modi government on a range of issues, as he tried to enthuse the party's booth-level workers ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The Congress leader observed that China has been providing jobs to 50,000 youth per 24 hours. \"However, the BJP-led government gives jobs to 450 youth in the same span,\" he said. \"The BJP-led government wrote off Rs 2.5 lakh crore loans of India's richest 15-20 people but a similar demand by farmers to waive their debt was ignored,\" he said. \"(Union finance minister Arun) Jaitley ji says it is not their policy to waive loans taken by farmers,\" Gandhi said.

A day earlier, actor Mansoor Ali Khan was arrested for making a threatening speech at the same meeting. He had allegedly declared that he would kill eight people if the eight-lane Chennai-Salem Greenfield Corridor is constructed.  On Tuesday, a journalism student,  , was detained by the police for threatening officers while protesting against the project.  Over the last three weeks, the opposition to the project – billed by the state government as a “game changer” for the economy of Tamil Nadu’s central districts – has been building up slowly.  The Opposition has questioned the alacrity with which the government is pushing the project, which will cost Rs 10,000 crore and will entail the acquisition of thousands of hectares of agricultural land and several hectares of forest land, cutting across five districts and eight reserved forests. Greenfield projects are those that are built from scratch.  In its eagerness to implement the project, the state government seems to have decided that any protest questioning the project has to be dealt with through police action. On Wednesday, the police picked up over 20 persons, some belonging to the All India Kisan Sabha, for organising a consultation meeting on the project in Tiruvannamalai. They were released that evening itself after farmers threatened to agitate before the superintendent of police’s office.  The government has begun work to mark the land identified for the project. This has led to opposition from farm owners, which too is being dealt with by the police. On Tuesday, MK Stalin, the working president of the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, tweeted a newspaper clipping of a photograph of several police officers picking up an old woman in Salem who opposed the land identification process. In the tweet, he questioned if Tamil Nadu was a democratic state or a police hunting ground. ஜனநாயக நாடா ? போலீஸ் வேட்டைக் காடா?  Farmers’ organisations in the region have now called for a black flag protest on June 26. This will be followed by an agitation on July 6 in which they plan to burn the government order that announced the project.   On February 25, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, in a letter to Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, suggested that a greenfield expressway corridor be constructed between Salem and Chennai “that will substantially reduce the distance [between the two cities] and save fuel”. Such an expressway will boost the socio-economic status of the state in a big way, the chief minister said. He wanted the project to be included in the Centre’s Bharatmala Pariyojana highway development scheme. On the same day, following a meeting with Palaniswami, Gadkari announced in New Delhi that the work on the project will begin in two months. He also said that the project would cost Rs 10,000 crore and it would be an access-controlled highway. The speed with which the Union minister’s announcement came – that is, on the day of the chief minister’s letter – raised several eyebrows. A Shankar, writer and transparency activist in Chennai, said it was not clear how the cost of the project was determined so quickly, if, of course, the February 25 letter was the first time the state government had suggested such a project to the Centre. “This could be the fastest ever cost identification in the country,” said Shankar. Things moved at breakneck speed from this point. S Shanmugam, state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, the farmers’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said  public announcements about the project and the land acquisition it entailed were made, and public meetings were called for. “But these public meetings have not taken place,” he said. “Instead, they have begun the work of marking the fields meant for acquisition.” Further, the chief minister’s letter mentions that three different routes connecting Chennai to Salem already exist. This are the 345 km Salem-Villupuram-Chennai route, 360 km Salem-Krishnagiri-Walajah-Chennai route and the 319 km Chennai-Tiruvannamalai-Oragadam-Tambaram route. The government has claimed that the new greenfield expressway will cut the distance between Salem and Chennai by 60 km, to about 270 km. However, the time to cover this distance will be cut by half of the current six hours.  After the Centre issued the terms of reference for the project in April, a consultant, Feedback Infra Private Limited, was appointed for a detailed project report. In its draft feasibility report, the   the existing routes take longer to traverse as they are not access controlled.  “The travel time from Chennai to Salem can be reduced from 6 hour 26 minutes to 3 hour 9 minutes with eight-lane greenfield express highway, whose alignment is also proposed to be integrated/connected with other highways planned/executed in Tamil Nadu state in the future,” the report said. The project will also cut transportation cost by 15% to 20%.  However, farmers’ organisations and activists are not convinced. They have raised two primary questions. First, if congestion is the problem, why is the government not undertaking decongestion efforts along the existing routes? Two, activists point out that if economic development was the idea behind the project, the Rs 10,000 crore that the project will cost could be used to improve last-mile connectivity of existing smaller roads in the region instead of developing an expressway between cities that already have three different routes connecting them. There is also confusion regarding the extent of land that needs to be acquired for the project. While the chief minister told the Assembly that the project would need 1,900 hectares of land, including 49 hectares of forest land, the minutes of an May 7 meeting of the Union Ministry of Environment’s Expert Appraisal Committee said a total of 2,560 hectares of land would be needed. There are about 32 settlements in the proposed alignment. “The tentative length of affected forest area along the proposed alignment is 13.290 km,” the minutes of the meeting said, quoting the project consultants. This would translate to about 120 hectares of affected forest land.  The project will also require 11,20,000 kilolitres of water during construction. Shanmugam said the project would cut through water channels and fertile agricultural fields. The highway will also pass through several rivers. At a time when the state is facing an acute water scarcity, such projects will not help, he said.  Chief Minister Palaniswami hails from Edappadi in Salem. Opposition parties allege this is the reason why he is eager to complete the project.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.026000000000000002,"negativity":0.069,"modiCount":5,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":10},{"content":"It’s going to be an action-packed day in the Supreme Court on Friday, 27 April, with important pleas – including the transfer of the Kathua rape case, the Ayodhya dispute and Shanti Bhushan’s plea on the master of roster controversy – scheduled to be held.

Niccolò Machiavelli lived in 16th century AD in Italy and wrote his book  .   though an economic title, is actually about statecraft, with a preamble to preserve Varnadharma (the fourfold caste order, with the Brahmin at the top and the Shudra at the bottom). It was written to preserve Hindu Dharma in ancient India, but its influence has remained on the subcontinent’s statecraft, except during the Muslim and colonial rule. However, it gained more prominence after Independence. It has been a book of study for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's (RSS') political and religious strategists ever since the organisation's inception in 1925. Its strategy of maintaining statecraft is threefold — political, religious and cultural. It propounds the political art of controlling state power through Hindu spiritual politics. , on the other hand, was written by Machiavelli to separate politics from religion. It was meant to liberate the European kings from the clutches of the spiritual control of the papacy. It is the initiator of the theory of the secular state: it separates the state's day-to-day functions from religious control. But both   and   advocate the \"end justifies means\" theory and combining the methods of \"Lion and Fox\" for achieving the ultimate goal. In independent India, Mohan Bhagwat is the most successful Kautilyan — and Indira Gandhi has been the most successful Machiavellian in both the Congress party and governance. The real ruler (whatever his caste; in ancient times, it was mostly the Kshatriyas, and today, it is Narendra Modi, a Bania OBC) does not handle full power, it is the Brahmin guru (Kautilya himself was a Brahmin guru) who calls the shots from behind. In contrast, in  , there is no guru to the king. In fact, the Pope was that guru for every king and Machiavelli aimed to finish that invisible guru’s hand in power play. The tactic succeeded in Europe and hence, secular states came into being. The RSS ideologically worked out a strategy that it should develop a system that continues the crucial role of the politically manipulative spiritual guru even in the democratic setup by negating the theory of separation of state and religion by systemically using the Kautilyan model with the Sarsanghchalak position. Within the RSS, the latter plays the role of Kautilya today while the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Sangh's political wing, rules the state. After the 2014 general election, though Narendra Modi (a Bania OBC) became the visible ruler — he is also a demagogic orator and vote puller for the unorganised masses — real decision making power has remained in the hands of Mohan Bhagwat (a Chitpawan Brahmin most eligible for that position, according to Hindu Dharma). During the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime, this Kautilyan role of the then Sarsanghchalak was not necessary as the prime minister was self-sufficient, though he was not a vote puller. Secondly, in the coalitional system, the guru’s role of invisible hand was not very critical. Hence, in the Vajpayee period — one dominated by alliances — Kautilya was dormant, and very much in the background. Now that there is full majority for the BJP, the guru is playing the role of re-uniting state and religion in India, which had been separated during the British rule — and largely remained so till 2014. This union will pose massive implications for the survival of democracy and the secular state in India. The Karnataka drama was played out by Mohan Bhagwat by invoking the Kautilyan principle of \"end justifies the means\". Operationalising this principle in the state was the goal of the RSS, the invisible hand. BJP's CM candidate here was BS Yeddyurappa, known as a corrupt Shudra and if he were to become the chief minister, he would have worked according to the direction of the guru. Crimes like lynching over beef eating, and attacking secular and liberal intellectuals are part of the Kautilyan statecraft. Kautilya was very clear, like Machiavelli, that once you assess the enemy, you must eliminate him/her by all means. Rationalist MM Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh were murdered in exactly this fashion. Many well-known intellectuals from Karnataka continue to live with police protection. The Congress' Machiavellianism began with Indira Gandhi dismissing the Left front government of Kerala in 1959, starting with her initiative as the party president, much against the views of her father and former prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru, by all means, was secular, but not Machiavellian. But during her time, Indira Gandhi continued the practice of \"end justifies means\" and was a victim of the practice. Though she was secular in her designs, without a guru or invisible hand throughout her political career, she achieved her ends. Emergency was its final product. Like the Machiavellian prince, she did everything on her own, without any underhand figure directing her. Since it was one-person regime, the state found a way out. What is more, when the invisible guru does everything and the real ruler pretends to not know (as Narendra Modi does) what is going on, the danger to the secular state and society is deeper. The Congress never had such a structure. The PM in the Congress rule is the prince himself! Manmohan Singh was the only exception to that rule — he was the PM, but without influence. He was a ruling economist. During his 10-year stint, no state government was dismissed unceremoniously; no genuine majority party or coalition was stopped from governing the state. Of course, that was because Sonia Gandhi — as Congress president — was no Indira Gandhi. Though she was born Italian, she has never been Machiavellian in her approach. Machiavelli’s prince was progressive for his times. To reiterate, separating the state from the religion was his ultimate objective. It did good to the world's welfare democratic system. The Kautilyan gurudom is its anti-thesis. Its end is to dismantle the democratic secular state and take India exactly on the lines of Pakistan, where the modern Mullahs rule. The Hindu guru and the Islamic Mullah have no differences when it comes to theocratising the state. If the RSS rule continues, the democratic morals of India's citizens will collapse. The guru’s handbook is not Ambedkar’s Constitution, but  The RSS opposes not only Machiavelli the Italian but also Rousseau, the French thinker. In their Kautilyan scheme, they are also opposed to democracy as an un-Indian system. If they come to power in 2019, they will move stridently towards their foremost objective — the abolition of India's election system.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.0575,"negativity":0.046000000000000006,"modiCount":2,"bjpCount":1,"rssCount":6,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":1,"_deepnote_index_column":12},{"content":"Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has come up with yet another issue against the Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal. If it was the issue of installation of CCTVs a month ago, this time it is his demand to direct IAS officers to end ‘four-month-long strike’ which was the reason why he chose to protest at the L-G’s office since Monday night. Kejriwal and four of his cabinet colleagues have stayed put at the lieutenant-governor's office since Monday, and demanded that IAS workers in the Delhi Government be directed to call off their ‘strike’. Kejriwal, along with Satyendar Jain, Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai, continued their protest. \"The chief minister and his colleagues have been staying put in the lieutenant-governor's office since Monday evening and would continue to stay until the lieutenant-governor directs the IAS officers to call off the strike,\" said AAP leader Arunoday Prakash. Significantly, hours before Kejriwal went to meet Baijal on Monday, he said in press conference, “The Centre and the Prime Minister's Office are continuously trying to stop the Delhi government from functioning. There have been repeated attempts to stop the development works initiated by the Delhi government.” He also said that it is for the first time in history that IAS officers have been on strike for four months. “The services come under the lieutenant-governor. As per rules, the IAS officers cannot call strike. We have made repeated appeals to the lieutenant-governor to direct them to call off the strike,” Kejriwal said. He added that the appeals made to the lieutenant-governor over the past four months have borne no fruit as the IAS officers continue to strike, and development works under the Delhi government have ground to a total halt. The AAP-led government in Delhi and the IAS officers in the state dispensation had a major face-off in February after the Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash alleged physical assault by ruling party MLAs at the chief minister’s residence. Kejriwal accused IAS officers of going on a \"continuous strike\" after the incident. Soon after the meeting with Baijal on Monday, Kejriwal tweeted: Significantly, the sit-in protest in Baijal's waiting room continued through the night and further intensified with Jain’s announcement that they would fast until their demands are fulfilled. Certainly, the protest by four cabinet ministers in Delhi came like a bolt from the blue for the lieutenant-governor's office, which has neither undertaken any measures to force them to leave nor decided to fulfill any of their demands. Kejriwal has declared Baijal an agent of the Centre and has also accused him of hindering Delhi’s development at the Centre’s behest. When alternative options are available to achieve an objective, a protest is seen as nothing but political posturing. “If the chief minister really wanted the officers to work, he could have filed a petition in the high court against the strike. What is the point in disturbing the work in lieutenant-governor’s office by holding a protest in it when a legal remedy is available?” asked Ashok Agarwal, a Delhi High Court advocate. Agarwal also said it is shameful on the part of the chief minister to disturb day-to-day affairs of the lieutenant-governor’s office. The AAP has claimed the Delhi government has proof that the officers are on strike. “We have minutes of meetings, attendance sheets of meetings and memos served to these officers for stalling the works of the people,” said Saurabh Bhardwaj, chief spokesperson of the Delhi government. Bhardwaj also said that according to rule 7 of their code of conduct, the IAS officers are acting illegally.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.01575,"negativity":0.081,"modiCount":4,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":13},{"content":"“Well doctor, what have we got – a republic or a monarchy,” asked an eager lady to Dr Benjamin Franklin as he was leaving the Philadelphia Convention which was wrought in secrecy. “A Republic – if you can keep it” replied the founding father of the oldest modern democracy in the World. One needs hardly say that the founding fathers of Modern democracy were as concerned with the principles of preservation as with the founding itself. Even before the days of the American Constitution James Madison in the Federalist papers notes the existence of different interest groups accentuated by various sentiments and views which had come up out of necessity. Many times these special interest groups gain ascendancy without the citizens’ awareness or concurrence. The deep-rooted partisan one-upmanship which characterizes American politics today proves the apprehensions of founding fathers true. Reference to rudimentary forms of Democracy is evident right from the most ancient text namely the Rigveda. We also find reference to the will of people upholding the Kings in their position in the Atharva Veda. Democracy as we know today has an ancient and dodgy past with everyone staking claim to its recent success while failures as usual stands orphaned. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Russia toyed with the idea of democracy, the philosophical victory of democracy over all other forms of government seemed final. Modern Democracy in the 21st century is, however, facing fresh challenges in the form of a non-democratic superpower who has come up to challenge this shortlived victory. The oldest modern democracy in the world is no longer as solemn in appearance losing its sheen after the recession years and the upcoming challenge from China. Democracy in India, on the other hand, stands as the biggest role model for the times to come. Democracy here in India had its fair share of challenges but the great survival instincts in the oldest civilization always saw it through. While our neighbours have gone through an extended period of Army Dictatorship or a tightly controlled media of the Chinese, India had proved to be an outlier in its success with democracy. Even the worst critics acknowledge that the better part of post-independent India has been peaceful at all points of time even while revolts (sometimes even violent) against the ruling establishment has not been uncommon in any region. As the world celebrates International Democracy Day, India stands as an outlier in South Asia for the rest of the world to emulate. Indian democracy never was supposed to be a success from the western point of view. While the western point of view doesn’t take into account the deep cultural roots binding this country together, their apprehensions did prima facie seem meritorious. According to pre-independence British thinker Strachey ‘India’ was merely a label of convenience, ‘a name which we give to a great region including a multitude of different countries’. In Strachey’s view, the differences between the countries of Europe were much smaller than those between the ‘countries’ of India. ‘Scotland is more like Spain than Bengal is like Punjab.’ In India, the diversities of race, language and religion were far greater. Unlike in Europe, these ‘countries’ were not nations; they did not have a distinct political or social identity. This, Strachey told his Cambridge audience, ‘is the first and most essential thing to learn about India – that there is not, and never was an India, or even any country of India possessing, according to any European ideas, any sort of unity, physical, political, social or religious’. It must come as a shock to these naysayers that the piece of land which doesn’t seem to have any political or social identity is a thriving democracy today. What these naysayers forgot to include was the cultural aspect which kept this nation together even while facing contradictions inherent in a diverse country. In comparison, the European countries knit together on language basis are facing a crisis in terms of confidence in democratic processes. EU did not exactly prove to be a paragon of democracy when the decision to introduce the Euro in 1999 was taken without any popular mandate. Only Denmark and Sweden held referendums on the matter (both said no). During the darkest days of the euro crisis, the euro-elite forced Italy and Greece to replace democratically elected leaders with technocrats. The European Parliament, an unsuccessful attempt to fix Europe’s democratic deficit, is both ignored and despised. In contrast, Indian Parliamentary proceedings and important debates are telecasted and discussed widely across the nation. In my opinion, Indian democracy too had its fair share of banes prime among it being the dynastic politics which started as back as during Independence. The one Nehru family which always thought this nation to be a family fiefdom more or less got away with its misadventures in governing this country for far too long. India has been struggling to break free from the clutches of dynastic politics which marred many democracies across the world. The first major challenge came from the south in the late 60s on the back of language agitation which saw the dynasty losing grip over vast parts of South permanently as the party continues to languish to this day. A few years prior to this, India curiously had the distinction of having the first democratically elected Communist party. It raised several eyebrows across the world but did fend off all communist tendencies till date as communists got ingrained in the democratic process. The Communist continued to have vast parts of India under its stranglehold via the democratic process. The democratic process continued to be undermined by the Emergency declared which saw the arrogance of the family coming out in the open in its most brute form. Indian democracy reacted and the people voted aggressively dealing a body blow to the party in the long term by creating strong regional rivals which could join along with the newly formed BJP in 1980. Indian democracy was slowly coming of age when began the phase of blatant appeasement which continues to this day. After the Shah Bano case where minorities were sought to be appeased, the nation erupted to right the historic wrong of not having the Ram Temple at the birthplace of Lord Ram. Political alignments changed and all who indulged in this sort of appeasement bit dust as many non-Congress governments came up across the country eventually leading to the first full term government without the ruling dynasty in it. There has been no looking back since then when India finally voted a humble man with poor origins to the highest corridors of power. It is of utmost importance to politicians like us that every man is an equal citizen with equal stakes at the highest corridors of power regardless of where he is born in. With nothing to show but a proven track record, sheer oratory brilliance and an intent to serve Mother India, Narendra Modi a man from a humble background came to power defying the powers that be. Indian democracy had won again – a big victory this time bringing the best out of democratic tradition. It has crossed a major hurdle where dynasty has become a bad word and all parties actively seek to disassociate itself from the tag. Unfortunately, another ailment grips this democratic system as we celebrate Democracy day – The single one family dynastic rule at the national level is replaced by a host of dynastic families cropping up in all regions of the country. I think a trend of a dynasty for each region has off late gained ground right from PDP in Kashmir to DMK in South. Most of the younger members of both the houses are by-products of one or the other families. As things stand today, India despite the dynastic tradition which it finds hard to shake off is still a beacon of hope in the world. Independent India has conducted elections which were largely free and fair and at regular intervals in line with the founding fathers. While elections alone don’t make a democracy, it helps that each citizen has a political stake in this nation and exercises his franchise at regular intervals. This, in my opinion, has been the biggest success of India even while suffering from dynastic politics. Mature democracies like India just like nascent ones require appropriate checks and balances on the power of elected government. Indian judiciary has time and again proved to be the appropriate check right from the days of Emergency. The same however can’t be said of media which has more often played to the tunes of the ruling family. When asked to bend, they drolled dealing a body blow to their credibility which got worsened with the advent of social media where everyone can raise a voice. As democratic institutions get strengthened and accountable under the present Modi Government, the trend of dynasty staying in the limelight looks bleak as an increasingly educated population asks questions of them. Globally, the Chinese with their supposed success story has burst the American myth of democracy as being the answer to all the ills of mankind. The founders of modern democracy such as James Madison and John Stuart Mill regarded democracy as a powerful but imperfect mechanism: something that needed to be designed carefully, in order to harness human creativity but also to check human perversity, and then kept in good working order, constantly oiled, adjusted and worked upon. While China with its stunning growth figures in recent decades can continue mocking the Democratic traditions, it conceals a far deeper problem. The 50 richest members of China’s National People’s Congress are collectively worth 60 times as much as the 50 richest members of America’s Congress. The inequity is far too glaring for a country which prides itself on communist traditions where the bourgeois needs to be dealt with. The bourgeois clearly seems to have taken over and the working class is ruled upon. It also needs to be seen whether the Chinese model of muzzling free voices and repeated brutal violation of human rights can be sustained over the long run in the modern world. Till then, the verdict on the non-democratic one-party rule will remain open. Democracy will continue to stutter, stumble and start but will not be easily out for technology will enable democratization of power and the requirement to be on the right side of public opinion. To conclude on a positive note, Alexis De Tocqueville once remarked that “Democracies always look weaker than they really are: they are all confusion on the surface but have lots of hidden strengths. Being able to install alternative leaders offering alternative policies makes democracies better than autocracies at finding creative solutions to problems and rising to existential challenges, though they often take a while to zigzag to the right policies.” I am surely not letting disillusionment with the political system grip me while incessantly working towards a better and stronger India. Let’s hope that the Great Indian democracy and the deep-rooted democratic traditions ultimately lead each one of its citizens out of poverty by the next decade even while it may take a while to zigzag to the right policies.

A former Indian Air Force officer and fighter pilot, Captain Reddy flew MiG 21s and 23s before a near-fatal air accident left him unfit to continue with combat duty. He then worked with the Rashtrapathi Bhavan before serendipity led him into politics. As the president of Congress' Telangana unit, he is striving hard to lead Congress to a win and creating its own state government again in south India, after a series of debacles and losses left the national party with its least power representation across 29 state capitals. Dismissing the “stunt” of dissolving the Telangana Assembly early by Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief and caretaker chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhara Rao also known as KCR, Captain Reddy said, “I thank KCR. If his greed and superstition had not led him to dissolve the Telangana Assembly, we would have had only a 4-0 verdict. Thanks to him, the people can show their emphatic support for the Congress with a full five-finger fury.\" Captain Reddy claims that the battle has turned around even though opinion polls and surveys points to a TRS win. Stating that advancing poll dates do not always work, Captain Reddy gives the examples of how the NDA government lost the Lok Sabha election in 2004 despite advancing the date and the fact that all surveys predicted a comeback. \"KCR knows that he has made a mistake and will be routed on 7 December. He can continue to posture till results are out on 11 December,\" he says. In the 2014 elections, TRS shocked Congress with a win. Even though it was Congress who created Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh, the party did not gain politically from the bifurcation, as per its estimations. Congress was routed in an angry post-bifurcation Andhra Pradesh. After his win, KCR poached leaders from the Telugu Desam Party and Congress, weakening them further. By the end of 2016, the Congress seemed too weak to challenge TRS, which had consolidated its position tremendously. Captain Reddy brought a turn around in Congress’s fortunes to an extent that the party is now credibly challenging KCR. The turnaround, coinciding with the rise of acceptance for Rahul Gandhi nationally and, slowly increasing despair within the BJP, however, has been old-fashioned. Captain Reddy has been working with Dalits, tribals, Muslim and women, travelling across the state, and building a social coalition. “The Congress had a traditional support with Dalits. The KCR government humiliated them since coming to power. The Nerella incident on 2 July, 2017, where he (KCR) had several Dalits arrested, and had them tortured when they protested against the sand mafia linked to his own family, became an emotional issue across the state. When TRS supported the police who illegally detained and tortured the Dalits, it brought to Congress its first major shot in the arm,\" says Captain Reddy, who, along with several other Congress leaders, have built a Dalit movement across the state since then. \"In what is surely a woman’s century, KCR has hurt women's sentiment by running the first-ever Telangana government without a single woman in the cabinet. He has stopped all funding and loans to DWCRA women's bodies. KCR will learn soon that no power can hold against the fury of women scorned,” said the former Indian Air Force Captain. Captain Reddy said that the KCR govt failed to fulfil several of the promises it made in 2014. “KCR promised to make a Dalit a chief minister once Telangana was formed. He promised two-bedroom houses for all Dalits, tribals, Muslims, OBCs and the poor. He also promised three acres of land to all Dalits and tribals. He promised to bring drinking water to every house and a job to every family. Not one of these have happened,” he said. In fact, the troika of promises of two-bedroom houses, jobs and water were crucial to not only bringing TRS to power but were deeply ingrained into the psyche of the people as legitimate aspirations. “Forget jobs for every youth or one in every family, even the over two lakh pending government vacancies have not been filled,” he adds. While the Muslims in Telangana are angry that the promise of 12 percent reservations has not materialised, parents are upset that scholarships for their children have not been released. \"During the Congress rule, the government used to regularly remit scholarships to all Dalit, tribal and OBC children. The TRS government has stopped paying scholarships. Far from fulfilling the promise of free education from KG-to-PG, even basic fees are not being paid,\" he says. Building on a promise of returning to a welfare-centric but growth-focussed government, Captain Reddy believes Congress has also succeeded in denting the Muslim vote by “exposing” the TRS by portraying KCR as a friend and partner of the BJP. “He has the elections brought upon early so he can fight the state elections with the AIMIM, and the Lok Sabha elections next year in alliance with the BJP,\" Reddy said. The Congress has formed alliance with the Telugu Desam Party, some Left parties and key intellectual leaders. The Dalit-Muslim coalition, along with support of the OBCs who have historically backed the TDP, despite the party having weakened considerably since 2014, believe there are many factors which suggest Congress may have a good shot at challenging or even defeating the TRS. The simmering anger amongst Dalits and tribals, the rising suspicion amongst Muslims about TRS being an ally of the BJP, besides unemployed youth and unempowered women, are all beginning to reflect as Congress leaders campaign through the state. “Wherever I go people tell me we are waiting to oust TRS and bring back Congress. It is the same in all five states. This is the beginning of the end for the Modi-KCR axis fashioned after the Hitler-Stalin pact,” says Captain Reddy, heading to his next meeting with farmers, for whom his party has announced a loan waiver of Rs 2 lakh in a single instalment.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.08324999999999999,"negativity":0.07225000000000001,"modiCount":2,"bjpCount":5,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":2,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":15},{"content":"The United States military has killed 100 Syrian soldiers loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in airstrikes in the province of Deir ez-Zor after the troops allegedly started a coordinated assault on Syrian opposition forces,   reported on Thursday.

The answer may lie with Modi, but it begins with Manmohan Singh, and his decision to reject aid from foreign governments after the tsunami in 2004. But more on that in a bit. Whether or not the UAE government ends up officially offering an aid package, the question remains: is India’s policy of refusing aid from foreign governments beneficial to us? The first argument is that India has the capacity to handle disasters like these. Those working on the ground may complain that better and more efficient allocation of funds is needed. But that is a problem that the Central and state governments can solve among themselves, without necessitating foreign aid. Kerala has suffered damages to the tune of Rs 21,000 crore. Other states have given around 200 crore, but clearly, more aid is needed. How can further aid hurt Kerala’s immediate relief and consequent rehabilitation efforts? You’re right, it can’t. So what’s stopping us from taking the help? India’s growing economic clout has been offered as a reason for saying “No, thank you” to foreign governments offering disaster relief. What’s more is that India has been a donor country after natural disasters in other countries. After the 2004 tsunami, India gave 26.5 million dollars to Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand. In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, India offered 5 million dollars in aid to the American Red Cross. An Indian Air Force aircraft also delivered 25 tonnes of relief supplies to the US. To those saying, “How can a nation rich enough to be a donor be receiving aid itself?”, here’s our counter-question. Just because India has become a regular donor to other countries following natural disasters does not mean we cannot accept aid ourselves. Does it make you a poorer country if you accept aid in times of a humanitarian crisis? No, it doesn’t. India can very well be a donor when others are in crisis, and a recipient when we ourselves are in crisis. That’s how interdependence should work, right? A government source told   that another problem is the diplomatic fallout of foreign aid. “Accepting from any one government opens the floodgates for others as well, and it would be diplomatically difficult to refuse from some while accepting from others,” the source said. We understand that India may not be willing to accept aid from certain countries. For example, in 2005, India had offered $25 million to Pakistan for the Kashmir earthquake, which our neighbours refused to accept. So it’s unlikely that India will ever accept any aid from countries like Pakistan, with whom there is a strained political relationship. Also, since when does foreign policy need to be uniform for all nations to avoid difficulties? Consider this analogy – simply because we accord some nations with the Most Preferred Nation status for bilateral trade, doesn’t mean we sour trade ties with all the other nations. The decision by the current Modi regime to reject aid is in line with the disaster aid policy set in December 2004 by then PM Manmohan Singh. Till then, India had gladly accepted aid from foreign governments after numerous natural disasters, right till the Bihar floods in July 2004. But the UPA government’s decision after the tsunami changed that. In the last 14 years, we’ve said ‘No’ to help after the 2004 tsunami, 2005 Kashmir earthquake, 2013 Uttarakhand floods and 2014 Kashmir floods. So the argument is: why should the BJP government reverse a policy that's been in place for 14 years? Firstly, because it may not be a good policy in the first place. For instance, accepting the aid package from Maldives may actually improve our troubled foreign policy equation with the nation. The 34 lakhs they have offered may be a small figure, but accepting it could be a big token of political goodwill. And finally, some fine print – as per India’s National Disaster Management Plan,  If the national government of another country voluntarily offers assistance as a goodwill gesture in solidarity with the disaster victims, the Central Government may accept the offer.” So why not do so? The MEA has also said that contributions to the PM's and CM’s Relief Funds are welcome from  . In light of all these arguments, my question today is – Is the Modi government rejecting all the foreign aid on offer without gaining much in return? And is Kerala losing out due to this policy by the Centre? (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

But the assault on February 2, it now emerges, was not a one-off incident. Several such violent attacks have been reported here since December, with the timing as a common link –always after Friday prayers. The February 2 incident received considerable media spotlight after the Jammu an Kashmir chief minister informed the Haryana chief minister about the assault on social media. News reports said the assault on the two Rajouri students, Aftab and Amjed was the fallout of a collision between motorcycles. Aftab dismisses this theory. “After offering prayers, we stopped at a tailor’s shop at Masani Chowk. Amjed was about to ride pillion when 10 to 15 youths on motorcycles came from behind and started beating us up. I cried for help, but no one came forward. We don’t know why we were attacked,” he says. The police booked unidentified persons under Sections 148 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC. Three youths arrested on February 3 have been released on bail. The ABVP, Rajput Sabha, Sartaj Group (that claims to be an NGO) and other fringe outfits have been protesting for withdrawal of the cases. They claim the matter has been given a communal colour. They have been burning the effigy of J&K chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, whose tweet had set the police into action. Kuldeep Yadav of Sartaj Group told  , “If the police fail to withdraw the case by February 15, we will step up the agitation.” The police claim the students were beaten up due to mistaken identity. Aftab did not tell his parents, fearing they would ask him to return home, till he gave a TV interview. The tall, lanky youth from Rajouri has calmed the nerves of his parents and is determined to complete his studies. His classmate Amjed is still fearful and refused to come on record. However, the locals and a letter to the police maintain that the assault was not an isolated incident. On December 22, a Muslim youth was allegedly beaten up by motorcycle-borne youths after he offered Friday prayers, stated a January 15 letter to the police by ‘Muslim Samaaj, Mahendragarh’. At the time of the incident, he was wearing a skull cap. On January 12, another Friday, three youths went on an assaulting spree: first they beat up two Muslim men as they walked out of the mosque; then, a short distance away, two men from West Bengal. Ten minutes later, they beat up two youngsters from UP in a vegetable market. And about 15 minutes later, they threw stones at the mosque. The two Bengalis were brick-kiln workers. Their contractor, Mukul Sheikh, said, “Maminul Mian (37) and Nabidul Mian (34) were assaulted after offering ‘namaz’. Maminul’s Aadhaar card and a note of Rs 500 were snatched. He was badly injured on his nose and eye.” The contractor did not approach the police considering it a stray incident. But when another of his men was beaten up near Masani Chowk on February 2, he submitted a police complaint. He was not the only victim that day. An ironsmith, who has a shop near the mosque, said four migrant labourers from UP were assaulted near Angoori Devi Dharamshala. This was the day when the two J&K students were beaten up. The police registered another FIR on the charge of assaulting four labourers and six persons have reportedly been booked in connection with assault on students and labourers. “All victims were wearing skull caps and they were attacked after offering ‘jumma’ prayers,” the ironsmith said, wishing not to be named. Some have returned to their native places and are unsure about returning. Mahendragarh SP Kamaldeep when asked about the other attacks, simply maintained that the police were investigating. Ever since the February 2 attack, a police van has been stationed outside the university, and a police official deployed outside the mosque. The ‘imam’, Maulvi Mubarak Hussain, says he is scared to venture out of his home located on the mosque’s premises. “I ask a friend to buy me things of daily need. I don’t wear a skull cap. I keep it in my pocket,” he said.

His remarks came after the Supreme Court on Wednesday constituted a fresh Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by a retired high court judge to further investigate the 186 anti-Sikh riot cases that were closed by an earlier SIT. \"Never in the history has any action been taken against those instigating communal violence in this country, because the ruling party at the Centre has either been the Congress or the BJP, those causing such violence,\" he said. Rampaging mobs had killed around 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi and elsewhere across India in the aftermath of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination by two of her security guards on October 31, 1984, in the national capital. The official figures of Sikhs killed was around 2,800. Noting that in 2014, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had demanded a SIT inquiry into the anti-Sikh riots, Sanjay Singh said: \"The BJP-led central government did not accept the SIT set up by the AAP government that was in power in Delhi for 49 days.\" \"It made its own SIT, so that the accused could be saved, and this has been questioned by the Supreme Court.\" \"This clearly shows that the BJP and Congress are hand-in-glove with each other,\" the AAP leader said. Former AAP MLA Jarnail Singh said the bills on anti-communal law and ethnic violence were never brought by the Centre before Parliament for passage. He demanded that these bills should be passed as soon as possible. \"It has been 33 years since the 1984 riots and the Supreme Court has now woken up to take action. Many witnesses have passed away during the period. Those who are alive should be given protection and trials be completed within a year,\" he said. The AAP leader said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should apologise to the people for neglecting the issue and also that the Congress should expel Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, who was accused of involvement in the riots.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.085,"negativity":0.1665,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":1,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":26},{"content":"DMK Patriarch Karunanidhi was not just a political stalwart but also an iconic figure in the Tamil film industry.

And the mother very often would tell others what a good girl she was. Often this mutual admiration would be on the dais of political rallies and government programmes in full public view. This was in 2011 and it continued for seven years as the mother's \"bhalo meye\" - or the good girl - obediently and with the right dosage of obeisance was toeing her line, fulfilling all her wishes and definitely becoming indispensable to her. The daughter in question is Bharati Ghosh, former SP of West Midnapore, and the mother is none other than Mamata Banerjee. Bharati, who was part of a UN peacekeeping mission for years and a former management student of Harvard, came to Bengal in 2011 and drew Mamata's attention after the latter took over as the chief minister of the state. From the state CID, she was made the SP of West Midnapore, which witnessed Maoist violence after 2008. Bharati, with her vast experience in war-torn places of Kosovo and Bosnia, was thought fit to tackle the Maoists. Like an efficient cop, she decimated the Maoists and was responsible for the death of their leader, Koteswar Rao, in a severe gun-battle. The other prominent Maoists operating in that area, and responsible for death of jawans in police camps, were wooed over with handsome packages, and the young turks who dreamt of a classless revolution were won over in the fold of the ruling party with posts, power and privileges. The backward areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore became free of not just the Maoist menace but of any dissenting voices. The districts surrendered and Mamata compensated with heavy doses of development, plugging all possibilities of a Maoist regrouping. And all this was largely possible because of Bharati Ghosh, who dared to be deadly different. Gradually, Bharati gained Mamata's confidence and according to the Opposition, she was less of a police officer and more of a party functionary. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in the 2016 Assembly polls, Bharati  . She was transferred by the EC from the SP's post for allegedly intimidating poll officers and overstepping her jurisdiction. In 2016, she was reprimanded for exceeding her brief and meeting political persons, especially Mukul Roy, then second-in-command of the Trinamool Congress, while model code of conduct was in place. The rap from the EC had no effect on Bharati as Mamata awarded her with prized posting, more power and punch, and greater responsibility. As Bharati went on antagonising Mamata's enemies, she scored brownie points in her career, obviously gaining in the confidence of the chief minister. But finally what soured the relation was Mukul Roy leaving the Trinamool Congress and joining the BJP. Bharati, known to be close and loyal to Roy, became a prime suspect in the eyes of the chief minister. As Roy started consolidating the base of the BJP in the Jungle Mahal area, there were rumours that Bharati was using her clout and muscle power to help him make deep inroads. The final nail in the coffin was the result of the by-election in Sabang in West Midnapore district. Though the Trinamool Congress won with a huge margin of over 67,000 votes and BJP came third, the latter increased its vote share by 17 per cent and that was enough to keep tongues wagging. The Congress-turned-Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP, Manas Bhuniya, who hailed from Sabang and was a strong critique of Bharati Ghosh since the time he was in the Opposition as a Congress MLA, saw this as an opportunity to turn Mamata against her \"good girl\". There were allegations from the district intelligence office that Bharati had held meetings with BJP leaders and was helping them improve their vote share. Logically, Bharati stood to gain by siding with the BJP. Mamata also had a hunch that Bharati would prefer to work for the party at the Centre given her ambition and career prospects. Immediately after the Sabang by-election results came out, Bharati was removed to an insignificant post as an officer of State Armed Police in Barrackpore. But Bharati   to the DG of police. While the resignation will help her think clearly on what should be the next step, it will also free her of her commitments to the service rules. She is threatening to open her mouth and settle scores. To swallow her resignation would mean handing over an ammo to BJP, since Bharati by virtue of being close to the ruling Trinamool Congress shared many secrets, especially the ones that the \"mother-daughter\" duo exchanged. Mamata has initiated an internal investigation against Bharati Ghosh to ensure she keeps mum, but given the stubborn daughter she is, Bharati might not buckle. Taking up the challenge of a duel, Bharati has also retorted saying that she too has a tale to tell.

In a majority 2:1 judgment, the SC declined to revisit its own 1994 ruling. CJI Dipak Misra and Justice Ashok Bhushan denied the plea, saying the 1994 ruling was made in the context of acquisition. Justice Bhushan, reading out the judgment on behalf of the CJI, said the earlier order of mosques not being integral to Islam was in the context of the State's right to acquire land under eminent domain. He said the earlier judgment has no bearing on the final Ayodhya verdict and hence, there was no need to reconstitute a new bench. Since the earlier judgment was only with respect to immunity from acquisition, it would not impact the Ayodhya land title suit. A three-judge bench will continue to hear the Ayodhya land title dispute and the hearing will resume from October 29. However Justice Abdul Nazeer dissented with his brother judges and said whether a mosque was integral to Islam needed a comprehensive examination and there was a need to refer the matter to a constitutional bench. He said what is essential to religion as laid down in the Ismail Faruqui case was arrived at without a comprehensive examination of religious texts. Hence, the issue needs to be re-examined in detail. He also   that the observations in the 1994 ruling have permeated the Allahabad High Court Ayodhya verdict of 2010 and the judgment needs to be brought in line with the Shirur Matt case. In 1994, while   of Dr Ismail Faruqui, a five-judge Supreme Court bench held that a mosque is not an essential part of the practice of Islam. It said that namaz could be offered anywhere and a mosque was not required for it. Dr Faruqi had challenged the acquisition of 67.7 acres land around the disputed structure. Ironically, reacting to the recent cases of disruption of namaz in open spaces in BJP-ruled Haryana, CM Manohar Lal Khattar had said there was no need to offer namaz in open spaces. This should only be offered in mosques.  The judgment paves the way for the resumption of the Ayodhya case and the timing of the verdict could alter the results of the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections. With the ruling BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi already promising a Ram Mandir in its 2014 election manifesto, politics around the Ayodhya case will only heat up in the coming days. The most significant aspect of the post-Babri Masjid political landscape was the changed social fabric of Indian society. While communal strains between both Hindus and Muslims had always been there, the demolition and the subsequent communal violence displaced caste with religion in the political discourse. The BJP was successfully able to take on caste-based parties like Mulayam Singh Yadav's SP and Lalu Yadav's RJD. The party's dream of cobbling together a cohesive Hindu vote bank was finally taking shape. After losing out to the Congress in 2004, and subsequently in 2009, the BJP had to fall back on its 'Hindu hriday samrat', Narendra Modi, to bring the party back to power. Going into 2017's Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections without a CM face, the BJP eventually zeroed in on another firebrand Hindutva leader, Yogi Adityanath, to head its government in the state. Predictably, the Ram Mandir was a part of the party's election manifesto   released by BJP president Amit Shah. The party reaped a rich harvest of votes focusing its campaign on the so-called Hindu exodus in Kairana, love jihad and the preservation of cows. But the last four years again altered the political landscape and threw a new set of challenges to the BJP. With its 2014 promise of 'achhe din' gone out to pasture, the party is faced with alleged corruption and nepotism charges, lack of jobs, and the politically suicidal price rise. All issues it had earlier taken up the Congress on. The BJP also went back on its poll promise of scrapping Article 370, when it decided to put it on the back burner to form a government with PDP in Jammu and Kashmir.  Probably realising the importance of ramping up the issue again, the party decided to walk out of the alliance in 2018 citing irreconcilable differences. Putting the blame for all that ails the country at the doorsteps of Nehru and the Gandhis is not bearing fruit anymore. The Narendra Modi government is expected to provide a list of its own achievements, something it is finding increasingly hard to do. Earlier asking for just five years to prove himself, the Modi government seems to have set a new deadline of 2022, but the voters are not taking the bait. It is also faced with a united Opposition, which, having realised the dangers of a united Hindu vote bank breaching its own political fortress, have come together to stop Modi from getting a second term. The 2017 by-poll defeats in Kairana, earlier held by the BJP's late MP Hukum Singh, who had floated the now debunked Hindu exodus theory, the Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats, vacated by the party's UP CM and Deputy CM, at the hands of a united Opposition, has put the party on the back foot. The prospect of SC/STs, OBCs and Muslims coming together is a nightmare the BJP could do without. A favorable verdict in the Ayodhya case could be a major shot in the arm of the the Narendra Modi government which had earlier been accusing the Opposition, and especially the Congress, of minority appeasement. While the official party line is Ayodhya is a matter of astha (belief), the political benefits are not lost on the party. With newly anointed Shiv bhakt, Congress President 'januedhari' Rahul Gandhi, increasingly toeing the soft Hindutva line, the BJP needs some serious juice to ramp up its own Hindutva quotient. In an attempt to reassure its Hindutva vote bank, several leaders of the BJP have already said that the party could also take an ordinance route if the Ayodhya judgment was not favourable. With the Supreme Court paving the way for an early verdict, the politics around the Ram Mandir is already getting a jumpstart.","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.098,"negativity":0.05349999999999999,"modiCount":6,"bjpCount":10,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":4,"islamCount":3,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":29},{"content":"The daughter of Assam BJP MP RP Sharma, was arrested along with 18 other Assam government officers on 18 July, as their handwriting did not match with that in their answer sheets in the Assam Public Service Commission (APSC) examination held in 2016, police said.

Jaitley, who was replying to a debate on the general Budget in the Lok Sabha, told agitating members from Andhra Pradesh, including those from the TDP, that a package was promised to the people of Andhra Pradesh after Telangana was carved out of it, and while several parts of the package had been implemented, some work was being done. Unhappy with Jaitley's statement in Parliament and claiming inadequate allocation of funds to Andhra Pradesh, Naidu on Thursday reportedly told the TDP MPs that the state was being given step-motherly treatment by the Centre. TDP, BJP's biggest ally in the South, earlier expressed disappointment over Jaitley's Budget that it said did not address the state's needs.

At least, that was his poll promise of \"na goondaraj, na bhrashtachar (freedom from goons and corruption)\" to the state. However, this year's Republic Day clashes tell a very different story altogether. As residents of Kasganj, belonging to different communities, began preparing for the 69th Republic Day celebrations, a group of ABVP and VHP cadres set out on a bike rally. Passing through every mohalla, they finally reached Baliram Gate. This group, which had no police permission, was also carrying saffron flags - enough to instigate a communal outburst. As they approached the minority-dominated area, their slogans grew louder. Soon, what started out as a verbal spat turned into a violent clash with both sides throwing stones at the other. One man reached for his gun and fired in frenzy which hit 20-year-old Chandan Gupta, killing him two hours later. Another man, Naushad, was also hit in the leg by a bullet and is now recovering at an Aligarh hospital. This was enough to trigger the mob, which went on a rampage across the town. The district police force was in Etah for the Republic Day parade as the town erupted into flames. A mosque was set ablaze and the police, in an FIR, said stones were hurled and bullets fired on them as they tried to quell the commotion. By afternoon, Yogi's promise of \"na goondaraj\" was blown into pieces as shops and buses burning to cinders became the image of Kasganj. The police, unable to control the situation, imposed curfew to restrict mob movement. One company of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and five companies of Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (UP-PAC) along with police forces from adjoining districts were deployed in Kasganj. The district magistrate, inspector-general of police, commissioner of Aligarh and at least half a dozen other IPS officers from adjoining areas were deputed to control the surging violence. But all these measures had no bearing on the rapidly deteriorating condition of Kasganj. Around 9.30pm, Lakhimpur resident Mohammad Akram, unaware of the violence, was on his way home with his pregnant wife in a Tata Safari. As he reached Kasganj, the mob attacked his car. They broke the windows with bamboo sticks and almost gouged out his left eye. \"They saw my beard and attacked me. My wife is expecting and the delivery is scheduled for tomorrow,\" Akram said, his face covered in blood. Akram was attacked in the middle of the town, Agrasen Gate, and the police was absolutely unaware of the situation. Fortunately, the local correspondent of Aaj Tak, Devesh Pal Singh, who was present there informed a senior police officer even as he recorded a video on his mobile phone. By this time, the mob had already put kerosene on Akram and his pregnant wife in an attempt to burn them alive. The senior officer responded swiftly and sent his forces just in time to save them. Akram is now recuperating in a hospital. Just 50 metres from here, BJP MP Rajveer Singh, along with a few other legislators, district magistrate and police officers were at the residence of Chandan Gupta, requesting them to cremate Chandan's body, but the family was struck to their demand of \"status of martyrdom\" for their dead son. The deadlock ended around 2am after the family was given verbal assurance of a government job to a family member and Rs 50 lakh as compensation. However, three days after his death, Chandan's family has received a cheque of Rs 20 lakh. On January 27, Chandan was cremated in the morning and even as his mortal remains were set on the pyre, Kasganj continued to burn. Around 200 meters from the cremation ground, one bus and a shop were set on fire while some locals vandalised a garage. Minutes later, three more buses and three shops were set ablaze by them. All the shops and vehicles were owned by the local Muslim population who till one day ago were living peacefully with the Hindus.  What was shocking was that these incidents were taking place within a range of 500 metres from where hundreds of policemen and two companies of paramilitary forces were standing guard.  As we witnessed, it appeared that a section of the locals belonging to a particular community were given a free hand by the local administration, allowing them to go on a rampage against the minorities.   Parliamentarian Rajveer Singh in a statement to us blamed the Muslims for the clashes. \"Muslims are responsible for this incident. It was pre-planned and they will be dealt with strict action,\" he said. Virendra Tomar, VHP leader, said, \"It's time for us to give a fitting reply to \"love jihad\". If they kill one of us, we will kill 10 of them. The police is our servant and they will work on our instructions.\" After several incidents of violence since the morning of January 27, the mob, led by a local VHP leader, took on the policemen. With no courage to face the crowd, a senior police officer called a VHP leader and requested him to ask their cadres to vacate the streets. The VHP leader agreed to the officer's request, but while walking away, he warned the police that within 48 hours, they will ensure that Kasganj is on fire. The political conspiracy was quite clear following the clashes which started on January 26. Now, there was only pressure from the innocent locals and media on the administration and police officers to act.  On January 28, when we confronted the suprintendent of police, Sunil Singh (who has now been transferred), as to why they failed to control the situation, he categorically said, \"This is being done on the instructions of a few people (higher-ups) and I cannot rule out any political conspiracy.\" His statement on camera probably cost him his job as he was transferred from Kasganj. Politics over Kasganj violence is at its peak with BJP and VHP leaders making controversial remarks, and parties like the Congress and the Samajwadi Party blaming the BJP for polarisation for the upcoming elections. In this political tussle, the ones suffering are the common people. Situated on the banks of Kala Nadi (Black river), most of the population in Kasganj is dependent on daily business for their survival. With a population of little above one million, Kasganj district has approximately 66 per cent Hindus and 33 per cent Muslims. And in last one decade, there has been no incident of any communal violence. Five days on, Kanganj continues to simmer while politicians are busy trying to cash in on communal sentiments.  ","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.06225,"negativity":0.1085,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":3,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":33},{"content":"The brother of a BJP councillor died in a hospital in Delhi on Friday, 15 June, after being shot by his neighbour as a dispute over a water connection turned violent, police said.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed the common man was suffering due to spiralling prices of such products and the government had \"looted\" the country of over Rs 11 lakh crore due to a levy of \"monstrous taxes\". \"The Modi government is selling cheap petrol and diesel to foreign countries, as Indians suffer due to the all-time high prices,\" he said. \"The monstrous taxes being levied by the government have resulted in the skyrocketing petrol and diesel prices. The Modi government has already profited by over Rs 11 lakh crore from draconian taxes on fuel,\" he alleged in a statement. The Congress leader claimed the petrol and diesel prices were at an all-time high and the common man, the middle class, the farmers, the transporters and small and medium businesses were bearing the brunt of it. \"Petrol and diesel in India are available in the range of Rs 78-86 and from Rs 70 to 75 respectively, but an RTI reply revealed the Modi government is selling petrol to 15 countries at just Rs 34 per litre and diesel to 29 countries at Rs 37 only. These include England, Australia, America, Malaysia and Israel. This is how the government betrayed and backstabbed the people of India,\" he alleged. Surjewala claimed in July 2017, the Congress had demanded that petrol and diesel be brought under the ambit of the GST, but the government and the BJP refused to listen. \"Now, the people of India will answer the BJP by giving it a befitting reply in the upcoming elections,\" he said. The Congress leader alleged the excise duty of petrol was just Rs 9.2 per litre in May 2014, while it is Rs 19.48 per litre now. He claimed the excise duty of diesel was just Rs 3.46 per litre in May 2014 to Rs 15.33 per litre now. The central excise duty has been hiked 12 times since the BJP came into power. He said the prices of essential commodities were burning holes in the budgets of the all Indians and the people would \"not forgive and forget\" the government for the \"fuel loot\" and they \"will give a befitting reply to the BJP in the forthcoming elections\". He said while skyrocketing diesel prices of Rs 70.26 per litre in Delhi were impacting farmers' lifeline, besides a stinging effect on the runaway food inflation, the prices of petrol which touched a high of Rs 78.57 per litre in Delhi had gravely impacted the transportation and commuting cost of the common man.

Bharadwaj is a prominent trade unionist and lawyer. Navlakha, a widely published writer and civil liberties activist, is 65 years old while Rao, a celebrated Telugu poet and Marxist intellectual and activist, is nearly 80 years old, according to his family. The FIR on the basis of which the arrests were made relates to the violence which followed the   held in Maharashtra on January 1 this year. Three of the arrested – Ferreira, Rao and Gonsalves – are due to be produced before a Pune court today. § On Tuesday morning, the home of   near Badarpur in Delhi was raided and she was taken into custody. According to the  , Bharadwaj has been charged under Sections 153a, 505, 117 and 120 of the IPC and several sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Orders for the arrest came from Swargate police station, Pune, acting on a First Information Report filed in January 2018, according to the police, and five policemen from Pune were part of the team that went to her house. The police were at her home from 5:30 am and all electronic devices were seized. Sources told   that the police took away Bharadwaj’s laptops, mobiles and a pen drive, as well as a diary with empty pages, and Bharadwaj expressed concern that these could be tampered with. Her daughter said that the police asked both of them to write down their email and social media passwords. When Bharadwaj’s daughter later tried to access her social media accounts, she reportedly found that they had been blocked. Despite a high court stay on her transit remand for two days, there was high drama as the Pune police sought to fly her out of Delhi before they could be formally served notice. Bharadwaj’s counsel, Vrinda Grover, told   she was eventually driven back to Faridabad and kept in a van outside the chief judicial magistrate’s residence past midnight. Inside, her lawyers sought a direction from the CJM to the police – as the high court had noted – that she be allowed to return home pending resolution of her plea before the Punjab and Haryana high court. The stay will be in place till August 30. § In Mumbai, the activist-turned-lawyer Vernon Gonsalves was also arrested in the morning. His 23-year-old son Sagar Gonsalves told   that a police team comprising of nine policemen from Pune and two from the local MIDC police station reached their home at  “My father, like always, had gone out for a morning walk. He reached home and within less than five minutes the police knocked at our door.” Sagar said their phones were confiscated and that they were not allowed to make any calls until   when Gonsalves was finally taken away. Gonsalves’ wife Susan Abraham is one of the lawyers who is appearing for  . Sagar said that when the police arrived at their residence, they were not sure if the police had come for Abraham or Gonsalves. “But as soon as they took away his phone and sat down with him and asked him several questions, we knew he would be arrested,” Sagar added. The police have taken away Gonsalves’ laptop, CPU of two old computers, his mobile phone, two spare phones, three pen drives and several books from his house. “Any book with Mao’s name on it or mentions of ‘Naxal’ and ‘political prisoners’ was taken away. A popular book on the Bolshevik revolution which was lying in the house was picked up too,” Sagar told  . § In Hyderabad, the veteran Marxist poet and intellectual Varavara Rao was arrested from his home on Tuesday afternoon and taken to Nampally court. His family has alleged that their house was ransacked by a team from the Pune police. Rao’s nephew Venugopal, editor of   magazine, told the TV channel Sakshi, “This is an attempt to stifle voices that talk about murders of Dalit and Adivasis in areas like Gadchiroli. There is a cooked up story that V.V. Rao was connected with an assassination attempt on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There is no truth to it. Apart from V.V. Rao, his two daughters and son-in-laws have been targeted. They do not have any connection with V.V. Rao’s politics. The Central government, Maharashtra government, aided by the Telangana government, are engaging in intimidation to stifle democratic voices.” § The Delhi-based writer and activist Gautam Navlakha was arrested from his home at around 2 pm. The police wanted to transfer him to Pune and obtained an order of transit remand from a court in Saket, but his lawyers, Nitya Ramakrishna and Warisha Farasat, managed to file a habeas corpus petition in the Delhi high court which the chief justice marked for prompt hearing. Since the documents produced in court were in Marathi – with only the transit remand in Hindi – the bench of Juatice S. Muralidhar and Vinod Goel said that it was “not possible to make out from these documents what precisely the case against the petitioner is”. It has asked for the translated documents to be presented in court on August 29. The high court said that it would hear the case Wednesday morning, and ordered that Navlakha be allowed to return to his own home under the supervision of the police till then. On Wednesday morning, however, the state of Maharashtra said it had been unable to prepare a translation of the Marathi documents, following which the court gave it time till afternoon. “Yesterday you seem to have had no problem with getting a translation,” the bench noted – a reference to police claims made in court on Tuesday that they had translated the FIR for the Saket magistrate who granted them transit remand. § Arun Ferreira was arrested from his home at around 3:15 pm. “I am been arrested in the same case as [Sudhir] Dhawale and [Surendra] Gadling. I will be taken to Pune now,” he said while being arrested. Police constables had been stationed outside Ferreira’s house in Thane. Around 15 officers from the Pune police landed up at Arun Ferriera’s place around 6 am. Ferreira, who stepped out briefly around 2 pm, told   that he was then still under interrogation. “The police is inquiring and the process is still on. I can’t say anything concrete right now,” Ferreira said. Ferreira, his wife Jennifer, his son and mother-in-law were home when the Pune police reached their residence. According to Ferreira’s family, the police told him to cooperate and said that they would only be carrying out search raids. It was only around 3 pm that he was told that he would be taken to Pune. His wife’s laptop and pen drives have been seized, and the entire family’s bank details have been noted, they told  . The panchnamas say that the arrested individuals will be taken to Pune later today. Ferreira spent five years in jail when the police in Maharashtra filed 10 UAPA cases against him. In 2012, he received bail and in 2014 was acquitted of all charges. Dipak Nikam, inspector, crime branch Pune, led a team of eight Maharastra police accompanied by the local Ranchi police to the residence of Father Stan Swamy with a search notice written in Marathi. The team searched Swamy’s room for about three hours. Nikam said that there is case in the Vishambagh police station in which Swamy is a suspect. “We have seized a laptop, memory card and compact disks. We had only a search order, and we did not have any arrest order for Stan Swamy.” Nikam said there is an organisation called Elgaar Parishad which is suspected to have links with the Dalit movement in Maharastra, and the Vishambagh police suspects that Swamy has links with Elgaar Parishad. When   spoke to Swamy, he said he has never heard of, let alone had links with, any organisation called Elgaar Parishad. Swamy has been actively speaking and writing against the BJP government’s alleged excesses against tribal people in Jharkhand. Recently, the state police had   because of his support for the   in which adivasis inscribe passages from the Constitution on stone slabs and place them at the entrance to their villages. Dayamani Barla and Vasavi Kiro, noted social activists who reached Stan’s residence when the search operation was on, said the BJP using these methods to harass Stan as he is fighting for the rights of the Adivasis. Teltumbde’s house in Goa, on the premises of the Goa Institute of Management, was raided while he was not in town. “He is out of Goa and his house was locked. He was informed by an official at the Institute that police had arrived at the campus with sanction to raid his house,”   a source as saying. Kavita Srivastava, president of the Rajasthan chapter of the People’s Union of Civil Liberties, told   on the raids and arrests, “We are outraged at what happened. This is a complete witch hunt. Completely false and baseless charges against top human rights activists. The Modi government is showing its fascist side. We are really going to fight back.” V.S. Krishna, Human Rights Forum Andhra Pradesh and Telangana coordination committee member, told  , “The letter produced by the police alleging assassination threat to Modi seems fabricated. The charges against those arrested today also seem outlandish and the UAPA has once again been used to clamp down on dissent.” A number of activists and political leaders including Swami Agnivesh, Teesta Setalvad, Jignesh Mevani, Shehla Rashid and Sanam Sutirath Wazir had issued a statement condemning the police action. ” The arrests should be seen in continuation with the recent attacks on pro-justice voices such as Swami Agnivesh, Umar Khalid and many other student activists from Delhi to Lucknow. A BJP lawmaker from Karnataka even advocated the murder of “intellectuals.” Both the arrests and the physical attacks on justice loving people must be seen in a series of attempts to stifle dissent and deny social justice. We demand immediate release of the arrested individuals, dropping of all false and malicious charges, as these arrests are politically motivated and unjustified,” the statement said.In a coordinated operation that has drawn fierce criticism from civil society and opposition political parties alike, the Pune police on Tuesday launched simultaneous raids on the homes of several people in Mumbai, Delhi, Ranchi, Goa and Hyderabad, including activists, priests, writers and lawyers. 6:10 am. 1:30 pm Among those whose residences were raided by the Pune police on Tuesday were Susan Abraham, journalist Kranthi Tekula in Hyderabad, Father Stan Swamy in Ranchi and Dalit scholar Anand Teltumbde in Goa. A relative of Varavara Rao confirmed that his daughter Anala and son-in-law K.V. Kurmanath’s house had also been raided, and their laptops and hard drives seized. A relative of Abraham’s said, “Susan and Arun are defending the   of last January.”  Those already arrested for the Bhima Koregaon violence include  human rights lawyer from Nagpur Surendra Gadling, Dalit rights activist and journalist Sudhir Dhawale, former Prime Minister Rural Development fellow Mahesh Raut, prisoners’ rights activist Rona Wilson and associate professor from Nagpur University Shoma Sen. In March, Milind Ekbote, president of the Samata Hindu Aghadi, had been arrested. He is the prime accused in the violence against Dalits which had left one person dead. He was released on bail in April. Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh’s leader Prakash Ambedkar had accused Hindutva groups of attacking Dalits who had gathered on the spot outside Pune to commemorate the 200 th  anniversary of a historic victory against the Marathas in which Dalit soldiers had taken part. The other leader named by Ambedkar, Sambhaji Bhide, has not yet been arrested. Maharashtra chief minister   investigations had shown that Bhide was not involved. ","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.0425,"negativity":0.1,"modiCount":3,"bjpCount":3,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":1,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":36},{"content":"As the death of tigress Avni in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district last week continues to create a furore, Maharashtra Forest Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has sought to counter the allegations made by Union Minister Maneka Gandhi, who has called the tigress’ death “nothing but a straight case of crime”. In an interview with  , Mungantiwar pointed out that with regard to the incident, all procedures were legally carried out as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NCTA) guidelines. The 'man-eating' tigress, Avni, (officially known as T1), said to be responsible for 14 deaths in Maharashtra's Yavatmal, was shot dead on the night 2 November after a massive operation spanning two months. Following reports of the tigress's death, Maneka Gandhi lashed out at the forest minister, saying that the shooter Asgar Ali “illegally” murdered the tigress. Refuting Gandhi’s claims, Mungantiwar said the shooter Asgar Ali, son of well-known shooter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, was authorised to be on the team carrying out the operation. Mungantiwar said the entire team was present on the night of the incident, indicating that the veterinary doctor was also present. He also added that Gandhi, who criticised his department on social media, did so without having full knowledge of the matter. Meanwhile, the shooter Asgar Ali maintained that he shot the tigress in self-defence and denied the “trigger-happy allegations” levelled against him. He maintained that efforts were made to capture and save the tigress over a period of two years, adding that this time around too, the team tried its best to capture the animal alive. Earlier,   to The News Minute, Asgar Ali had expressed sadness over the killing, saying, “What kind of satisfaction can one get by killing the national animal?” After her her tweets, Maneka Gandhi also asked Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis to “remove” state forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar from his post, calling him a “liability” and accusing him of issuing orders to shoot tigress T1 in Pandharkawada, allegedly without any effort to tranquilise her,  reported on Tuesday. Gandhi also said a petition is being readied to be presented in court against T1’s “murder”. News18 reported that Maneka wrote another letter to Fadnavis, reiterating her demand of removing Mungantiwar. Responding to Gandhi’s reported demand, Mungantiwar told the channel, “I will resign if what I am saying about the SC order is wrong. Else she (Maneka Gandhi) should resign.” Earlier on Monday, when asked about Union Minister Maneka Gandhi's statements on the tigress' killing, Fadnavis said the former had used \"harsh words\". In a series of tweets on Sunday, Gandhi had said, \"It is nothing but a straight case of crime. Despite several requests from many stakeholders, (Sudhir) Mungantiwar, minister for forests, Maharashtra, gave orders for the killing.\" Fadnavis had said, \"She (Maneka) has used harsh words. But her sentiments should be understood. All animal lovers' sentiments are harsh regarding this incident. It was a difficult decision. Whether the procedure was correct or not will be checked.\" Devendra Fadnavis had also said on Monday that the killing of Avni was a sad incident and any procedural lapse in it would be probed. Speaking to reporters, he said, “There is no happiness over the killing. The forest department took the decision since she had killed 13 to 14 people. There are some doubts regarding whether the tigress was first shot and then the dart inserted, this aspect will be probed.” \"We speak of increasing tiger population and conserving wildlife, and then unfortunately such a decision had to be taken. The tiger is a gentleman. He attacks only if his habitat is violated. Preliminary reports with me say the tigress attacked the forest department team and she was shot in self-defence,\" the Maharashtra CM said. \"Hunter Asgar Ali was hired by the forest department. The doubts raised regarding the killing will be verified,\" he added. Rahul Gandhi also tweeted against the killing of the tigress, which prompted a strong reaction from Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan. Vardhan hit back at the Congress president, saying no previous government has worked with the kind of “depth and seriousness” this dispensation has. The government does not need a certificate from Rahul Gandhi, Vardhan said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Except that it won't stay that way for long. \"The crops that you are seeing now will soon wither away because the water level at the Krishna Raja Sagar dam has reached dead storage,\" says farmer leader KS Nanjunde Gowda, who has been fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Srirangapatna constituency of Mandya district for the upcoming Karnataka Assembly election. Fielding Gowda was a strategic move part of the BJP's attempt to capture the farmer vote that used to go to the Janata Dal (Secular), as HD Deve Gowda's outfit projects itself as a farmers' party. It is also an attempt to make inroads into the agrarian constituency given that the BJP government at the Centre is accused of being anti-farmer. Furthermore, Mandya is in the heart of the Cauvery delta, a region that turns into the epicentre of protests whenever Karnataka and Tamil Nadu get into a tiff over the release of water downstream. The   had asked the Centre to formulate a \"scheme\" within six months for management of the release of Cauvery water. This deadline expired on 29 March, leading to flared tempers in Tamil Nadu, which accused the BJP in New Delhi of looking at the dispute through the Karnataka political prism. The Centre subsequently secured an extension of the deadline till 3 May. On Friday, the Centre requested the court for two more weeks' time to submit its proposal, by which time results of the Karnataka election would have been announced. Perhaps aware that nothing will happen over the Cauvery legally, so far, no political party has taken an aggressive position over the issue. That is also because all of them are united in opposing the formation of the Cauvery Management Board. Except Darshan Puttaniah. The 40-year-old candidate fielded by Swaraj India from Melkote constituency is incidentally also supported by the Congress, a part dead set against the formation of the board. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah even wrote to the prime minister expressing his party and government's opposition to the formation of the board, as that would take control of release of Cauvery water away from Karnataka. \"The board should be formed, but not just with bureaucrats from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry and the Centre. It should also have representatives from the farming community of these states who understand the ground situation better. This is the only way we can regulate this better,\" Puttaniah said. Others do not agree. They point out that the situation in Karnataka is as bad as if not worse than Tamil Nadu. Subhash, a farmer, objects to Karnataka being made to look like the villain of the piece every time Tamil Nadu needs water. He says even though the final court order gave more water to Karnataka, in real terms, it amounts to nothing. \"It's not as if we are brimming with water and still don't wish to part with it. Our situation is more critical than Tamil Nadu's. What the court has done is like taking away Rs 1,000 from our pockets and given us Rs 100 instead,\" Subhash said. The south Karnataka farmer's confrontational approach has its roots in the dire situation on the ground. According to farmer associations, in the last five years, more than 300 farmers have killed themselves just in Mandya. \"This election, our priority is to elect a leader who will speak on behalf of farmers,\" says Mahesh. \"Mandya grows Rs 2,000 crore worth of crops and we do not get the right value because of water shortage.\" What is perhaps needed the most in this crisis is for someone to look closely at the crop the farmers choose to grow. Paddy and sugarcane are highly water intensive and there is an urgent need to switch to crops that need less water. However, that is easier said than done, as the economy is driven by sugarcane, and jaggery factories are powerful entities here. So it is impossible to drastically cut down on the area under cultivation of sugarcane. How is the Cauvery issue then playing out in the run-up to the 12 May election in Karnataka? For one, each party, especially in the Cauvery delta constituencies, is going out of its way to talk about how it protected the state's interests even when Tamil Nadu was agitating for adherence to the Supreme Court order. It is this 'Karnataka First' approach that candidates in the contest think will get them the support of the ryots. On the campaign trail, the tragedy is there are no solutions offered to the Cauvery dispute, only homilies. The real test for the new government will come after 15 May when the Centre is duty bound to abide by the verdict.

Suhas Dashrathe is a veteran Shiv Sena leader who has spent 38 years in the party. Prakash Mahajan is a brother of late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, while Harshvardhan Jadhav is a former MLA. The Shiv Sena leaders left the party just ahead of Municipal Corporation Election in Aurangabad, which is scheduled for April this year. Sena is heading the Corporation at present for many years. The move came after MNS tilted towards Hindutva after that space was vacated by Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. Harshvardhan Jadhav said that the cause of Hindutva taken up by Raj Thackeray appealed to him. “I will definitely work to expand the party’s base (in Aurangabad). We will definitely win the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation,” Jadhav said.

In the meanwhile, MNS stepped up its attack on Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray challenging him to fulfil his commitment of deporting illegal immigrants. They put up posters outside Thackeray’s resident Matoshri, which said, “Honourable Chief Minister, if your stance is that Pakistani and Bangladeshi infiltrators must be thrown out of the country, then first clear the neighbourhoods in your Bandra backyard that are brimming with infiltrators.” On 23rd January, on Bal Thackrey’s birth anniversary, MNS chief Raj Thackrey had revealed the decision to change the flag to Shivaji Maharaj’s Raj Mudra or the royal seal was the original idea for the flag.

The agency acts as the Central Counter-Terrorism Law Enforcement Agency and is empowered to deal with terror-related crimes across states without special permission from the states.\n\nThe involvement of PFI was suspected in the recent anti-CAA riots across the country. Three people associated with the radical Islamic organization, including UP state head Waseem, have been arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police for orchestrating violence by spreading misinformation through social media platforms. Intelligence agencies had also reported that PFI and SIMI were behind the violence during the anti-CAA protests.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.10725,"negativity":0.10849999999999999,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":41},{"content":"On Saturday, the radical Islamist organisation, the Popular Front of India (PFI) came out in support of the AAP leader Tahir Hussain and claimed that he had been a victim of “vicious politics”. The PFI has squarely blamed the Centre for the violence in Delhi and also hit out at the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for suspending Tahir Hussain.\n\nThe role of Aam Aadmi Party leader Tahir Hussain in the brutal murder of Intelligence Bureau (IB) employee Ankit Sharma and also inciting riots in the Delhi has now been under scanner.\n\nEyewitness accounts have revealed that Ankit Sharma was lynched to death by a Muslim mob. Journalist Rahul Pandita managed to get hold of multiple eyewitnesses who saw the young officer being dragged inside Tahir Hussain’s house by an enraged mob before his dead body was found lying in a drain.\n\nThe unruly Muslim mob perched on the top of Hussain’s building wildly flung bricks and petrol bombs at the opposite street, in order to attack a Shiv temple located there. A building adjoining to the temple was burnt down by the rampaging mob. The incessant attack on the temple structure had rendered the entire edifice rickety and tottering, on the verge of collapse. Following the riots, media teams that had visited Tahir Hussain’s house had found stones and bricks, petrol bombs, acid packs etc lying on the roof.\n\nNow, another horrific tale of the Muslim brutality inflicted upon the Hindus from Tahir Hussain’s bungalow has come to the fore. Muslims who lived for years intertwined with Hindu families in Moonga Nagar suddenly started baying for their blood. In one such incident, Muslim residents of the region did not even spare a wedding house whose Hindu women used to address neighbourhood Muslim men as “Bhaijaan” and greet them with a “salam”.\n\nTahir Hussain has gone missing soon after the FIR was registered against him for his direct involvement in the murder of Ankit Sharma, on the complaint of Ankit’s family. The Delhi police had filed a case against the AAP leader under Section 302(a) Murder, in the Dayalpur police station of Delhi.\n\nNevertheless, the usual suspects came to his defence to absolve him of any wrongdoing. AAP social media head Ankit Lal shared a video wherein Tahir Hussain claimed that he was rescued by the cops after his house came under seize on February 24. Netizens were quick to point out a February 25 video wherein he was seen wearing the same dress and holding a stick in hand. ‘Eminent intellectual’ Javed Akhtar concluded that the religious identity of Tahir Hussain might have been a factor in the police crackdown against him.\n\nEarlier, a report of UP State Intelligence has revealed the role of Bhim Army and PFI in orchestrating simultaneous violence in Aligarh and Delhi.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.0685,"negativity":0.15300000000000002,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":5,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":42},{"content":"The 20th Century witnessed two of the bloodiest wars in the entirety of human history. More than seven decades have passed since the end of the second world war and as it happens very often, much of what was known, or should have been known, has been forgotten. However, there are certain patterns that can be deduced through observation alone. And it is those aspects that we shall focus on here. In the second world war, unlike what has traditionally been believed, there were three totalitarian ideologies competing for supremacy, arguably at a global scale. The three primary actors, certainly the three most powerful ones, were the flagbearers of these totalitarian ideologies. One of the ideologies was vanquished in the second world war, another at the end of the cold war. The one that emerged victorious on both these occasions still survives and expectedly, it is not considered totalitarian in the 21st century. The first, of course, was Nazism and the second was Communism. The third, which emerged victorious against both these ideologies, was, needless to say, Liberalism. Nazism ceased to be a serious political force with the end of Hitler’s Germany. Communism suffered the same fate with the dismemberment of the Soviet Union. Liberalism, however, is the state ideology of the world’s only superpower: The USA. People may argue Liberalism is not totalitarian in nature and everyone has human rights and freedom of speech but one must also reconcile themselves with the fact that people who live in a totalitarian regime do not consider the regime to be totalitarian. For instance, it’s extremely unlikely that in the world George Orwell created in 1948, the residents perceived the state to be totalitarian. For them, a totalitarian society was ‘normal’. Similarly, people who live in a liberal society are unlikely to consider it tyranny. It’s only from the outside that it looks totalitarian. In the 20th century, the similarities between these three ideologies wasn’t so apparent as these three ideologies were at war with each other. However, in the 21st Century, as Liberalism’s stranglehold over power became nearly complete backed by military prowess of the US military, the similarities have become more than apparent. Today, we look at some of glowing similarities between Liberalism and Fascism. Adolf Hitler, as we are well aware, was obsessed with the supposed superiority of the ‘Aryan Race’. In his bid to ‘secure the future’ of the ‘Aryan Race’, he committed the genocide of Jews in Germany. Similarly, liberals in the West are obsessed with race too. In fact, they are so obsessed that a strong candidate for the Democrat nominee for US Presidential elections in 2020 lied about her race and claimed that she is Native American despite the fact she is not in order to gain political benefits. Furthermore, prominent liberals in the US can be regularly found to be engaged in anti-White rhetoric where they can be seen cheering for ‘White Genocide’, all the while denying that such a thing exists. In India, liberals are obsessed with the Aryan-Dravidian race theory despite the fact that it has been regularly debunked by scholars and academics. But that hasn’t stopped Indian liberals from continuing to further the race theory. The obsession that liberals have with race is very similar to that shared by Nazi Germany. In India, the rhetoric that liberals employ against Brahmins is akin to the one employed by Nazi Germany against Jews. In mainstream Dravidian politics, which is cheered on and encouraged and sustained by liberalism, the propaganda against Brahmins are is completely alike that fueled by Nazis against Jews. In Nazi Germany, the media served as the propaganda wing of the fascist government. We see a similar pattern in the liberal world. The media was an extended arm of the Nazis. In the USA, we see the mainstream media act as the propaganda wing of the Democrat party. The collusion that was observed between news networks and Hillary Clinton was for all to see. The liberal American media has even justified violence by Antifa goons against their political opponents. In India, we see the mainstream media serve as the propaganda wing of the ‘Secular’ parties. There is extreme collusion between the political establishment and the media. The Liberal media demonizes the opponents of secular political parties and their supporters, exaggerates minor events in order to benefit secular politicians and whitewashes and buries news that could adversely impact secular parties. It’s an incestuous relationship between Liberal Media and Liberal political parties and they work together in the same fashion as the media and politicians in Nazi Germany. However, there is one distinct difference between the media-politics nexus in the world of liberalism and Nazism. In Nazi Germany, no efforts were made to hide the relationship. But liberalism, in order to be more effective, claims to be ‘independent’ and ‘neutral’ even when they are clearly not and buries the incestuous relationship under layers and layers of carefully constructed diversions. The relationship between the Media and politicians in Nazi Germany and in the Liberal World stems from the ideological unity between them, the material benefits that are gained are only a second-order requirement. Loyalty to ideology is the main motivation. In Nazi Germany, the Academia served the Nazis greatly and even helped shape their ideology and provided them with ideas and techniques to help them achieve their nefarious objectives. We see a similar pattern in the liberal world. The political parties rely on academia for acquiring footsoldiers and legitimizing their evil agenda while the latter relies on the former for patronage. The Academia also provides Liberal politicians with footsoldiers and innovative techniques in order for them to achieve their political goals. Here, again, we see a complete unity of ideology between the Academia and Liberal political parties. It is the same in the US as it is in India. The liberal parties work in tandem in order to indoctrinate the youth and achieve ideological objectives. In Nazi Germany, there was complete coherence of ideology between the political establishment, the Media and Academia. A similar pattern is also observed in the world of Liberalism. The three departments, together, with complete ideological unity between them, form the Liberal Establishment in the 21st century. The arms of the Liberal Establishment then work in tandem, like Nazi Germany, to crush dissent and entrench itself in the corridors of power. The Liberal Establishment crushes dissent, demonizes its opponent unfairly and unceremoniously removes them from power all the while accusing their political opponent of being fascists, despite the fact that it is the structure of their politics that is completely akin to Nazi Germany. No stones are left unturned in order to secure their power. In India, the Liberal Establishment has also engaged in the genocide of Hindus and Sikhs, in Kashmir and in 1984 respectively. The three arms of the Liberal Establishment attack and defend together. Whenever the power of one arm is under threat, the other arms immediately comes to their defense. For instance, when there is a threat to its political power, the academia and the media immediately rushes to their defense in order to defeat its political opponents. When political rivals attempt to remove stranglehold of liberals in academia, political parties and the media rushes to its defense. When the monopoly of liberals over media is threatened, the academia and political parties rush to provide cover. And together, they fight to ensure that the Liberal Establishment continues to thrive. Simultaneously, the opponents of the Liberal Establishment are crushed by the three arms together and it’s ensured that opposing ideologies never get a foothold in these institutions. If someone or some entity succeeds in gaining legitimacy in these three arms, then they demonized and every effort is made to tarnish their reputation and destroy their lives. In many instances, people actually lose their lives and their death is brushed under the carpet as an insignificant statistic. And on and on it goes. The most distinguishing feature of a totalitarian society or a totalitarian ideology is that the power structure isn’t merely interested in what an individual says or how he acts but also how people think. It is not enough to merely say or act in a certain way, a person must also believe the ideology completely. Otherwise, the person can be accused of a ‘thoughtcrime’ and persecuted accordingly. In George Orwell’s 1984, ‘thoughtcrime’ describes a person’s politically unorthodox thoughts, such as unspoken beliefs and doubts that contradict the dominant political ideology. We see a similar pattern playing out in the liberal world. Merely accusations and allegations combined with certain ‘suspicious’ behaviour is enough reason to completely destroy an individual’s life. For instance, a person does not have to be a ‘homophobe’ or ‘misogynist’ in order to have his life completely destroyed and ruined, mere accusations are enough. Furthermore, anyone who does not endorse the most extreme positions of the Liberal world is branded ‘homophobe’, ‘misogynist’, ‘regressive’ or whatever the latest buzzword maybe and then it is demanded that his professional career be destroyed. Mere differences in political opinions are treated as thoughtcrimes and efforts are undertaken to crush the individual. Everyone who disagrees with a liberal is Sanghi and fascist against whom even violence is justified. ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans and chants of ‘Vande Mataram’ are deemed as provocations.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.099,"negativity":0.131,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":43},{"content":"Amid blame game on northeast Delhi violence, Union Minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday accused Congress of indulging into vote bank politics and not acting responsibly for maintaining peace and harmony.

Speaking about the oppositions' outrage over the amended Citizenship Act, the minister reminded that NPR was started by the Congress-led regime and accused Congress of changing its stand on granting citizenship to persecuted minorities. Prasad said, 'Sonia Gandhi, please don't preach us 'raj dharma'. Your record is full of twists and turns.' While addressing the media, the BJP leader said, 'Congress can stoop to any level for vote bank politics, but it should act responsibly for maintaining peace and harmony in the country.'

At the same time, media professionals seen as BJP-leaning, even household names, are being picked up for interrogation by opposition state governments or arrested on a whim. Their economic viability is being seriously threatened: One leg of the plan is to intimidate advertisers, another leg of the plan is to destroy the system of TRPs altogether. In opposition ruled states, the secular ecosystem is able to follow up these tactics with extensive “direct action” on the ground. There is of course Bengal where high profile dissenters are shot in full public view. In Bengal, workers from opposition parties are murdered and hung from trees and poles so that everyone can see. On their shirts, the death squads write clearly that this the punishment for joining BJP. In another state, storm troopers showed up in jackboots at the house of a Navy veteran who dared forward a cartoon. An A-list Bollywood celebrity said a word against a secular government. The next day, they showed up at her house with bulldozers. Again, this is when the BJP is in power at Centre. Imagine what would happen if the Congress were to somehow come back to power. Whether or not you would like that is another matter. The question is this: if Congress comes back to power tomorrow, do you think you as a citizen will be able to utter a word against them? You might be wondering. So what if Congress comes back? They have ruled India so many times. With one terrifying exception in 1975, democracy has mostly been fine. True. But this time it is different. Let me explain why. Because technology. A decade ago, when technology took off as a medium of political communication in India, a senior establishment leader had remarked that the internet is an ungovernable sphere. Back then, the opportunities seemed limitless. Anyone could go online and say anything. And it could spread anywhere, depending on how much attention it got. That’s changed. From this utopian vision of a free and ungovernable realm of ideas, technology has become a machine that can be used for totalitarian thought control. We are putting everything online: our shopping habits, our tastes in food, drink and travel. And of course our personal and professional communication. And the pandemic turbocharged this phenomenon. For the first time in history, common people are talking to each other in writing. I remember that a hardcore leftist journo had observed this astutely in 2012. Each one of us now has a digital footprint, with all our thoughts on record. The personal has become public. Take the case of that Navy veteran who was beaten up because he forwarded a cartoon. Ten years ago, the old man would have made the joke orally to a small circle of friends. And nobody would have known. But now, he posted it on social media. The storm troopers got to know. Never in history, not even under the worst of dictators, has such targeted micro level action against dissenters been possible. Now, it is. Today, it is possible for a government to target literally every dissenter. Do you think Congress is not going to use it if they get a chance at power? What does ‘targeting’ mean? Jackboots at the door? Not necessarily. Even though the dissenting Navy veteran was identified by the power of technology, he was targeted in a rather primitive way. This could never work on a large scale. In India, there would be literally hundreds of millions of dissenters. How many doors would the storm troopers break down? Again, technology has a much more chilling solution to tackle this problem on a large scale. There’s no need to beat up dissenters individually. With one line of code, the dissenters can all be placed on a blacklist, accused of “spreading hate.” The next day, they will all lose their jobs and everyone from banks to mobile phone operators will refuse to do business with them. How would they survive without a job, without a bank account or even a phone? Think it can’t happen? It’s already happening. The Chinese call it the ‘social credit system.’ If you fall out of favour with the government, your life gets progressively harder, to the point that you would not be able to buy so much as a bus ticket. You can then agree to “reform” by showing your loyalty to the government and slowly raise your “social credit score.” You think the secular overlords will reject this technology if they get a chance? Am I being too dark and too pessimistic? After all, China is China. We’re a democracy. They can’t do this here. Fine, how about the United States? They are the oldest democracy in the world. Last week, the New York Post published an explosive story about business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of US Presidential candidate Joe Biden. Those who tried to tweet the story or plug it on Facebook found that it was impossible to do so. Even via direct messages… They did this in the US. Still think they can’t do this here? Okay, this time they got caught. But they still fulfilled their main objective, slowing down the story. Next time, their algorithms will tackle this even better. Next time, they won’t get caught. Around 2010, the secular ecosystem was caught flat footed and complacent by the rise of social media. They mocked the medium because they didn’t understand it. A lot of real people began speaking for the first time. This collective voice played a huge role in destroying the UPA government. Stung by the defeat, they’ve learned well. They turned their full propaganda machinery towards owning the digital space. They put up “news” website after website in quick succession, with massive funding, top notch production and media graduates swarming into the new space. They fanned out across YouTube and Instagram, building a massive coalition of influencers. On the right, the resistance was patchy at best. Most were real people, with real day jobs, families and bills to pay. It is commendable that they held the fort for so long. But anyone who sees the internet space today will know that the resistance is rupturing badly. There was only so much that hobbyists could have done to stop a well oiled machine. All other pieces are in place. All that remains is for their friends to get back in power. The moment they get that back, they will take ownership of most of their loudspeakers in the old media of TV and newspapers. Most of it still works for them anyway. The handful of right leaning media will be snuffed out quickly by government action, threatening advertisers or banning them under the excuse of “stopping hate.” This time, they will have a third and most potent weapon: technology and dominance in the digital space. The legions of influencers and the brands are in place already. You will be blasted with propaganda at all levels. With the personal sphere becoming public, your reaction to each event will be under their scrutiny. The smallest show of dissent will be punished, not by jackboots at your door, but by a faceless algorithm that will destroy your life in a millisecond. The old dictators were prone to creating martyrs. This time, there wont be martyrs because nobody will come to know.

On a personality basis, Narendra Modi was even further ahead and Rahul was simply nowhere. And now, it is time to analyse the Delhi elections according to Google Trends. The election turned out exactly the same way. Here is what the map looked like in the 30 days before April 24, 2019. Blue for the BJP and red for the Congress. On April 24, 2019, Google Trends said India was an ocean of blue. How was the Congress going to win when nobody even cared about what they had to say? I had also pointed out how Google Trends appears to have accurately captured the Congress surge in the three Hindi heartland states in Dec 2018. Just look at the Google Trends map for the period Sept 1, 2018, to Dec 1, 2018. See how the BJP seems ahead almost all across the Hindi heartland except for Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the three election-bound states. If Google’s wisdom seems so profound in states with huge rural populations, surely it should be taken even more seriously in Delhi. A purely urban electorate saturated with media and the internet. So what does the BJP vs AAP comparison look like in the last 30 days in Delhi? First of all, take a moment to admire just how accurately Google Trends picks up what is going on in the minds of the public. What is that sharp red spike for AAP? It’s from Jan 14, 2020. And when did AAP announce its candidates? On Jan 14, 2020, of course! You don’t even have to look that up. Google Trends knows everything. But other than that, the BJP (blue) dominates over AAP (red) almost uniformly. And you can see that interest in BJP is peaking, rising almost in hockey-stick fashion. This is bad news for AAP. Wait! There is an obvious objection and one must address it here. The BJP is a national party, while AAP is not. Perhaps BJP is getting more interest simply because people think about BJP in the context of a much wider range of issues, while AAP only matters in local politics? So let us see the related searches for BJP in Delhi, according to Google trends. It is evident that all these searches are related to the state election and not national issues. So we know two things for sure. First, BJP is getting much more interest in Delhi than AAP is. Second, the interest in BJP is driven primarily by local issues and not national issues. Now I know there are some opinion poll agencies (with absolutely pathetic track records, I must add) which have projected the Delhi election as some kind of one way victory for AAP. I don’t trust them. I’d rather look at Google Trends data. By now, everyone has noticed that Kejriwal has maintained a safe distance from the CAA issue. He’s stayed away from Shaheen Bagh. In fact, in recent days, top liberals have also been begging with Shaheen Bagh protesters to temporarily withdraw their movement for strategic reasons. Is Kejriwal confident? I doubt this. Again, keep in mind that Delhi is a 100% urban environment where media and internet matters a lot. And AAP is media savvy, known to have an extensive online presence. Despite this, Google Trends shows interest in BJP clearly ahead of AAP. One last thing. AAP is synonymous with Kejriwal. How about we compare BJP vs Arvind Kejriwal? Again, pretty big and uniform lead for BJP and the gap only widening in the last few days. If you ask me, that’s the classic surge that the winner gets towards the end.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.08625,"negativity":0.025,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":15,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":46},{"content":"Days after a 16-year-old girl has gone missing for her house in Rewari, Haryana, the family of the minor girl has alleged that a Muslim boy lured her and took her away.

It was reported yesterday that a Muslim family supplying water to the neighbourhood stopped the supply to these Hindu families from January 17 after three among them reportedly participated in an event called ‘Janajagratha Sadass’ supporting CAA. This event was held at Valanchery town a week ago. According to a report in The Times Of India, Akhila Cherukunnu Parambil, a Hindu resident has said that the one Muslim family who supplied them water was pressurized by people of his community to stop supplying water to them, after photos of three men of the colony attending the pro-CAA program was circulated on a social media group. Akhila said that the water supply scheme of gram panchayat has not been functional for more than a year and that they were forced to travel about 1 km every day to fetch water. One Muslim family had been supplying water to the local people. “Recently, they arranged a facility to pump water from a water source to their home. They offered three buckets of water to each of the family in the colony. On Friday, a woman member of the family told us that photos of three men of the colony attending the pro-CAA programme as being circulating on a social media group in the locality and the family cannot continue to provide water as they were under pressure from a section of people to stop the supply”, said Akhila. CP Velayudhan, a former CPM branch committee member, also confirmed that since the Muslim family had suddenly stopped supplying water many people in the colony, irrespective of party affiliations, were affected. However, Sainudheen Kalappadathil, a member of the Muslim family has been quoted by the TOI report that the water supply was hindered due to some technical problem. For the last three days, RSS’ Seva Bharati has stepped in and have been supplying water to the colony. Following the boycott of Hindus by Muslims, there is widespread anger for blocking the basic necessity of these residents. It is pertinent to note that Malappuram in Kerala has one of the highest concentration of Muslim population and according to Census data nearly 70% of residents of the district are Muslims. Shobha Karandlaje, the BJP MP from Karnataka flagged the issue on social media stating that Hindus of Kuttipuram Panchayat of Malappuram was denied water supply as they supported the Citizenship Amendment Act. The BJP MP also expressed her fear regarding communist Kerala taking baby steps to become another Kashmir. Taking a cue from her, many BJP leaders raised the issue through their Twitter handles on Thursday, following which the revenue authorities decided to convene an all-party meeting and take immediate steps to restore the water supply. Now, there has been an FIR lodged against Karandlaje for ‘promoting religious enmity’. Tirur tahsildar T Murali, who visited the colony on Thursday said that revenue authorities will file a detailed report of the incident to district collector Jafar Malik on Friday. “Panchayat authorities will take immediate steps to provide water to the colony,” he said. The anti-CAA protests are increasingly turning communal lately which is evident across the country. As Muslim groups failed to put pressure on Modi government despite unleashing violence on streets across the country, now even targeted, planned attacks on Hindus are being reported.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.025,"negativity":0.0845,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":3,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":9,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":49},{"content":"The Sunni extremists in Pakistan stopped the organisers of the Aurat March for women’s right in Islamabad from completing a mural, claiming it was against Sharia.

Within six months of Narendra Modi’s second term as Prime Minister, his government took several monumental steps to strengthen the territorial integrity of India as well as bring to closure disputes that have festered in the country ever since independence. MEA Jaishankar, too, has on several occasions hinted towards the fact that the current government wishes to resolve disputes that it has inherited from predecessors. Narendra Modi has always demonstrated remarkable clarity in matters of governance and politics. It was, perhaps, most evident during a debate on the Big Fight with Rajdeep Sardesai as the anchor in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks almost two decades ago. During the debate, he called out the mentality and the worldview that is now amplified by the anti-CAA protesters when they made ‘La ilaha ilallah’ the central theme of their protests. In the debate, Narendra Modi said, “Indian media never had the courage to use the term Islamic Terrorism because pseudo-secularism weighed heavily upon them. When, last Tuesday, after the attack in the USA, when global newspapers started using the term, then for the first time, and I wish to compliment Rajdeep Sardesai for the same, that they have demonstrated the courage to say the truth.” However, immediately, Rajdeep Sardesai “clarifies” that NDTV had not used the world “Islamic terrorism” in its reports. “We don’t need the compliments from you,” Rajdeep is heard saying in the video clip just after Narendra Modi’s opening remarks. Narendra Modi, who hadn’t become the Chief Minister of Gujarat yet, added, “As far as Islam is concerned, it has numerous positive aspects, yes. The question is, in what way is it being used by people today. Where do the roots of it lie? When one community argues that their community is different from everyone and superior when it is argued that until and unless you adopt my ways, you will not be able to attain Moksh, Allah or Jesus, then conflict is bound to arise.” He continued, “And I believe, India has advocated the philosophy of Truth is one but approaching it is many. If this remains the root of one’s ideology, that every path is equal, then there’s no possibility of conflict. But when I argue that yours is false, mine is true, conflict arises and hatred manifests itself. And when this hatred combines with sentiments of nationalism, then terrorism occurs.” The politician who would go on to fundamentally alter the direction of the Indian State also said that instead of criticising Islam as a whole, it would be better to focus on those elements who are using it to further their nefarious agenda. Rajdeep Sardesai, true to his nature, quickly retorts, “We haven’t used the term Islamic Terrorism, we have only raised the question. So we don’t need the compliments from you at the moment.” The words spoken by Narendra Modi almost two decades ago are still relevant to this day. The notions of supremacy that he alluded to during the debate are relevant to this day as can be seen in the manner in which ‘la ilaha ilallah’ was made the central chorus of the anti-CAA crowd. ‘La ilaha ilallah’ is a declaration that means ‘There is no God but Allah’. It’s a slogan that denies the existence of all Hindu Gods and Goddesses and calls them false. That it has been made the central focus of political protests ought to concern every sensible citizen of the country. Even Shashi Tharoor, one of the most ‘secular’ politicians from the Congress party was disturbed by it and when he called it out, he faced intense criticism and protests from the anti-CAA crowd. Later in the debate, Narendra Modi further elucidates the manner in which terrorism manifests itself. He said, speaking of the ideology of the terrorists, “Terrorism has reached the strength it has today because it is intertwined with fundamentalism. You have to understand that Muslims, and when I say Muslims I do not mean Islam, they have divided the world into three parts.” Explaining himself, he said, “One, Dar-ul-Aman, second, Dar-ul-Harb, third, Dar-ul-Islam. Dar-ul-Aman means land of peace, that is, where Islam has reached or not in a position to assert itself. There, peace should prevail. Then Dar-ul-Harb, where you have the strength, fight for it, plant your flag. And the third is Dar-ul-Islam, to convert the whole world to Islam. To this end, certain political activists who belong to the Islamic faith are indulging in these activities. Until and unless we understand these people, we will not be able to tackle terrorism.” As expected, Modi set the cat among the pigeons with his explanation of the ideology that motivates terrorists. Rajdeep Sardesai, consistent with his nature, tried to interrupt him on several occasions but he managed to get his points across in spite of the cacophony. Narendra Modi did not stray away from his points even when accusations of Islamophobia were levelled at him. He said clearly that he was not levelling allegations at the entire Muslim community but only explaining the motivations that drive terrorists to commit the crimes they do.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.10749999999999998,"negativity":0.09525,"modiCount":7,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":51},{"content":"In a shocking revelation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday, most of the 127-odd terrorists arrested by security agencies in India for suspected ISIS links were inspired by the speeches of radical Islamic preacher Zakir Naik.\n\nAccording to reports, National Investigation Agency director YC Modi speaking at a conference of anti-terror teams on Monday said that terrorists and their sympathisers who had joined ISIS were inspired by speeches made by Zakir Naik.\n\nHe further outlined the emerging terror challenges before the country at the conference of top police officers.

Often ignored by the media and Muslim leaders, there is wide scale discrimination present in Muslim society between two factions- Ashraf and Ajlaf.\n\nThe Muslim society divides itself into two categories- The decendendents of Arab or other invading groups (also called ‘Ashraf’) and the local converts (known as ‘Ajlaf’). Though the Qur’an doesn’t mandate the creation of such groups, these terminologies emerged when the Islamic invaders from the west attacked and conquered portions of the Indian subcontinent, and converted local Hindus at the tip of the sword. Apart from this divide, there exists a Hindu varna-system among the Ajlaf category of Muslims, which is based on the caste they/their family belonged to before converting to Islam (eg- Muslim Rajputs).\n\nOn top of the Muslim caste hierarchy lie the Syeds, who are considered to be the direct descendants of Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Syeds have traditionally married within their caste and usually don’t marry someone outside of their community (for example, the Pathans). The Syeds are believed to be descendants of Husayn Ibn Ali, the grandson of Islamic prophet Muhammad, while the descendants of Hasan Ibn Ali (brother of Husayn) are called ‘Shareefs’. The two communities are often at the forefront of Muslim social hierarchy and are very influential in Islamic society.\n\nAt the bottom of the Muslim society are the Pasmandas of the Ajlaf category, who comprise of ‘Shudra’ and adivasi converts. Persion word for ‘those who have fallen behind’, the Pasmandas are the most discriminated group within Indian Muslims. Comprising of 85% of the total Indian Muslim population, the Pasmandas are politically the least represented group within the Muslim community in India.\n\nOnline news portal Firstpost published an article by Ajaz Ashraf in 2019, who spoke about the rampant discrimination against the Pasmanda community amongst Indian Muslims. According to Ajaz Ashraf, around 7,500 MPs were elected between the First and the Thirteenth Lok Sabha. Of them, 400 were Muslim and only 60 of the Muslim parliamentarians were from the Pasmanda community. The Ashrafs, though just 2.01 percent of India’s population, represented 4.5% of the seats between the First and Thirteenth Lok Sabha.\n\nThere have been several reports of discrimination against the Pasmanda community by upper caste Sharifs. According to the same Firstpost article cited above, writer Ajaz Ashrah witnessed that there were separate ‘lottas’ of drinking water for the Dalit Halalkhors (sweeper caste) and Mehtar castes in Muslim dominated areas. Similarly, there was clear discrimination in mosques where the upper caste muslims prayed in the front rows while the lower caste muslims prayed in back rows. In some places, Dalit Muslims are not allowed to access public burial grounds reserved for the Ashrafs.\n\nIslam, as a religion, has also resorted to such discrimination when the topic of ‘Caliphate’ arises. According to the Hadith, only a member of the Quraysh tribe (to which Mohammed belonged) could be the Islamic caliph. This is a sharp contradiction to the carols of ‘equality between believers’ the Qur’an brags of in its verses.\n\nThe Print has also accepted the existence of a caste system in Muslim society, though hilariously denouncing the caste system as a “Brahminical disease” in the first line of its article while referring to caste system amongst Muslims. The Print alleges that members of the Ashraf community hijack the politics of Muslim society during elections by declaring votes towards them as an Islamic duty, and taunt the Pasmanda members who stand as candidates.\n\nOn the 1901 caste census in British India, Dr BR Ambedkar had opined, “The Muslims do not realise that these are evils and consequently do not agitate for their removal. Indeed, they oppose any change in their existing practices”. (Ref: Pakistan or the Partition of India, pp. 218-223)\n\nAmbedkar had further stated, “Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. Regarding slavery nothing needs to be said. It stands abolished now by law…But if slavery has gone, caste among Muslims has remained…There can thus be no manner of doubt that the Muslim Society in India is afflicted by the same social evils as afflict the Hindu Society”.\n\nThis proved that Dr BR Ambedkar was not a fan of the Indian Muslim community, and had realised that the caste system was rampant amongst them as well. This played a pivotal role in his decision to adopt Buddhism as the standard faith for his Dalit followers.\n\nIn 2016, the BBC had published a report on the ‘untouchable’ Muslims. According to the report, when “Dalit Muslim” respondents were requested to share their experiences inside homes of upper-caste Hindus and Muslims, around 13% of them reported having received food/water in different utensils in “upper-caste” Muslim houses. Similarly, 8% of “Dalit Muslim” respondents report that their children are seated in separate rows in classes and also during school lunches.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz is at the forefront of politically mobilising the lower caste Muslims in North India. There have been several chants of equality by the lower caste Muslims against the Syedist patriarchy that is practised in Muslim society.\n\nDespite the rampant discrimination, negligible political representation and strategized alienation from Muslim society, the plea for help by the lower caste Muslims is left unanswered by the largely upper-caste Muslim political organizations, and shall soon be eliminated if the lower caste Muslims stand up to the Ashrafs.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.041,"negativity":0.07425,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":2,"pakistanCount":1,"_deepnote_index_column":53},{"content":"On Saturday, the radical Islamist organisation, the Popular Front of India (PFI) came out in support of the AAP leader Tahir Hussain and claimed that he had been a victim of “vicious politics”. The PFI has squarely blamed the Centre for the violence in Delhi and also hit out at the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for suspending Tahir Hussain.\n\nThe role of Aam Aadmi Party leader Tahir Hussain in the brutal murder of Intelligence Bureau (IB) employee Ankit Sharma and also inciting riots in the Delhi has now been under scanner.\n\nEyewitness accounts have revealed that Ankit Sharma was lynched to death by a Muslim mob. Journalist Rahul Pandita managed to get hold of multiple eyewitnesses who saw the young officer being dragged inside Tahir Hussain’s house by an enraged mob before his dead body was found lying in a drain.\n\nThe unruly Muslim mob perched on the top of Hussain’s building wildly flung bricks and petrol bombs at the opposite street, in order to attack a Shiv temple located there. A building adjoining to the temple was burnt down by the rampaging mob. The incessant attack on the temple structure had rendered the entire edifice rickety and tottering, on the verge of collapse. Following the riots, media teams that had visited Tahir Hussain’s house had found stones and bricks, petrol bombs, acid packs etc lying on the roof.\n\nNow, another horrific tale of the Muslim brutality inflicted upon the Hindus from Tahir Hussain’s bungalow has come to the fore. Muslims who lived for years intertwined with Hindu families in Moonga Nagar suddenly started baying for their blood. In one such incident, Muslim residents of the region did not even spare a wedding house whose Hindu women used to address neighbourhood Muslim men as “Bhaijaan” and greet them with a “salam”.\n\nTahir Hussain has gone missing soon after the FIR was registered against him for his direct involvement in the murder of Ankit Sharma, on the complaint of Ankit’s family.

While a Tanishq showroom in Gujarat has condemned the ad and apologised to the Hindu community for it, liberals are falling over backwards in justifying it. Perhaps the most clownish ‘hot take’ came from senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor who decided to pounce upon the occasion to peddle his personal delusions. Under normal circumstances, we would ignore such comments as the mad ramblings of a con-artist who has long passed his sell-by date but since the opinion has been voiced by an individuals who ‘larps’ as an intellectual, it deserves a response. Shashi Tharoor remarked on Tuesday, “If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them (‘Hindutva bigots’) so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” This is a preposterous claim. A country that lost huge portions of its territory to Islamic terrorism only seventy-three years ago cannot be the longest surviving symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ by default. Even after an event as cataclysmic and traumatic as the partition of 1947, if certain individuals wish to propagate India as a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, then they are deluding themselves. It is also evident in everyday discourse that India is not the symbol Shashi Tharoor and members of his party wish it to be. The events since 2019 have cemented these facts and have left no room for doubt. The response to the abrogation of Article 370, the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Ram Mandir verdict highlighted the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two communities in excruciating detail. While ‘secular’ intellectuals and politicians prefer to sing paeans to ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, it is an undeniable fact that the only Muslim majority state in the country refused to join the Indian mainstream and clung on to Article 370 that essentially provided for an Islamic state within Indian territory. When the article was abrogated, the Congress party and Muslim-oriented parties opposed it tooth and nail. With regards to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Indian Muslims wanted the descendants of those who created Pakistan to have the same privileges as the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist populations of the Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan towards whom India has a sacred commitment. The Act witnessed great protests and eventually culminated with communal riots in Delhi. The same could be observed in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi. Much violence and bloodshed could have been avoided if the Muslim community had chosen to respect the special attachment that Hindus have towards the birthplace of Rama. But they refused to, they fought until the very end for a Masjid built by an Islamic tyrant after demolishing a Hindu Temple. Thus, we see that the much exalted ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ that charlatans such as Shashi Tharoor evaporates into thin air on every major contentious issue. ‘Evaporates into thin air’ is perhaps the wrong phrase to use here since such a unity never existed in the first place. And these are only three of the most contentious issues in recent times. There are other long-standing issues such as cow smuggling and consumption of beef where there is no consensus between the two communities. Things escalated to such a degree that members of Youth Congress slaughtered a calf in broad daylight in Kerala and consumed its meat. That the leader of such a party claims that India is a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ is indeed a disgrace. Having said that, it is true that India is a symbol of a greater ideal. There is an idea at the core of the Republic of India, unfortunately enough, it is an idea that is reviled by men and women of a secular bent. However, it cannot be denied that India is the manifestation of the Hindu Civilization in the Age of Modernity and it is the custodian of the great civilization. It is India’s sacred duty to serve and protect our Hindu Civilization. Thus, India is not a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ but evidence of the superiority of Hinduism itself. India is the only country that is home to a heterogenous polytheistic culture. For Indians, the multiplicity of the Divine is not a theoretical proposition but a lived reality. There is no other country in the world where its citizenry worships a multitude of Gods and Goddesses, with their own unique strands of traditions and ritualistic obeisance, with equal fervour. Maa Durga, Shri Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Maheshwara, Swami Ayyappa, Ganapati, Kartikeya, Lakshmi, Saraswati, there is a plethora of Gods in the Hindu pantheon and we worship the many. A wise man once remarked that polytheism is the highest expression of human consciousness and it is only in India that it finds its true expression in the 21st century. India is the cradle of civilization that has shaped and continues to shape the destinies of multiple nations. And it is so because of Hinduism and Hinduism alone. Thus, secular politicians may want us to bend over backwards to accommodate their perverse fantasies but their misguided notions shall find place in our country no more. Hinduism is India’s destiny and it is Hinduism that defines India at the international order. There is no need for us to be apologetic about India’s Hindu identity; we are living in an age of Hindu assertiveness after all. Shashi Tharoor may be uncomfortable with the idea but it is one that he will have to live with. For it is the invisible threads of Dharma that holds our country together. Peoples from different cultural, linguistic, regional backgrounds with their own unique traditions and culture lend their allegiance to India not because of fancy ideals enshrined in our Constitution. They do so because such diverse peoples are held together by the strands of Hinduism that is not always visible but always felt nonetheless. Only Hinduism could ever hope to hold such a diverse country together. And there in lies its inherent superiority. Thus, India’s destiny and Hinduism’s are intertwined inseparably and it is one that will last till eternity.

The corridors of power see many footprints where ecosystems rise and fall at the will of the people, where rulers bite the dust and from the ashes, other rulers, for better or worse, emerge. The will of the people reigns supreme – again – for the better or worse – but the will of the people reigns supreme nonetheless. In India, especially, democracy has a 24/7 job. Every election cycle ends with the beginning of the preparation for the next election cycle. After the 2019 General elections, we have had elections in several states, with many more to go before 2024 General elections. After the results are declared for every election, in a society which has now been divided on the basis of ideology, whether one agrees or not, there is one section of the population for whom democracy ‘lives’ and another, for whom democracy ‘dies’. However, to the credit of the non-Left, they have been far more gracious in accepting the people’s mandate compared to the Left. The Left often blames people, calls the majority population ‘Hindu extremists’ assuming that only Hindus voted for the BJP and that every Hindu who did, is an “extremist”. They cry, whine, abuse, blame the system, blame democracy, curse the mandate, curse the people, curse the leader, evoke Nehru and Gandhi and the Holy Pope even to express their angst. Their angst mainly revolves around the fact that the people who voted BJP refused to agree with them or fall for their propaganda. The non-Left, thankfully, simply dust themselves off and prepare for the next battle. At least traditionally, they did. Any party focussed on the Hindu cause and one that does not either control or bow to the Left ecosystem has tasted long bouts of electoral loss. Only recently, have the political bells starting tolling in favour of the BJP, that has traditionally, been aligned with the Hindu cause. With political power and streaks of unprecedented victory, the non-Left has started mirroring the Left in their response to defeat, thankfully, not completely.

However, until now, the organizers of such events have never bothered to disassociate themselves from the hate that is often observed towards Hinduism or the slogans against the integrity of the Indian Union.\n\nOne reason for QAM’s statement could be the fact that the slogans in support of Sharjeel Imam were a vow to fulfill his dreams and unfortunately enough, Sharjeel Imam’s dream is to convert India into an Islamic State. Moreover, the possibility of homosexuals and transgenders being caned in public or thrown off rooftops will increase exponentially if India is converted into an Islamic State. Therefore, a significant section of the LGBT community is naturally not comfortable with that and hence QAM’s condemnation.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.107,"negativity":0.099,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":58},{"content":"The Zakat Foundation, as we have reported earlier, is linked to the Radical Islamic preacher Zakir Naik and a host of Islamist organisations. Furthermore, they demand ‘proportional representation’ and reservations for Muslims in government jobs. The Zakat Foundation, aside from its extremely problematic views, has been relentless in making their demands heard regardless of which government is in power. When the Congress was in power in 2013, the Zakat Foundation had met the then PM, Manmohan Singh and demanded that seats where Muslims form a large population be ‘delimited’ and Rahul Gandhi had promised to add it in their 2014 manifesto. Delimitation is the act of redrawing boundaries of Lok Sabha and Assembly seats to represent changes in population. While the delimitation is in process, the number of seats allocated to a state also change depending on the population and demography. The delimitation committee’s decision is considered sacrosanct and cannot be challenged in any court of law. Initially, when the Delimitation Committee was formed, the idea was to ensure equal representation of every segment of the population and also to ensure that no political party gets an advantage in the electoral process by ensuring that the geographical area was divided fairly. During the negotiations for Ram Janmabhoomi, the Zakat Foundation was a part of the process. They had posed 8 extremely problematic demands to concede the Ram Janmabhoomi. Eventually, the negotiations failed, however, it is important to understand the mindset of the Zakat Foundation through the demands they made. One of the demands made by the Zakat Foundation was “The constituencies of Lok Sabha and state assemblies where the Muslim population is very high while the Scheduled Caste percentage is not among the highest should be de-reserved. Instead, reserve those constituencies where SC percentage is among the highest, as recommended by the Sachar Committee.” This demand stems from the ZFI’s intention of increasing Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha. The ZFI is of the opinion that the number of Muslim MPs in the Lower House of the Parliament is less than the number it is supposed to be in terms of their proportion to the Indian population. In short, they wish to have Muslim MPs proportional to their share of their population, a demand that was summarily rejected by the Constituent Assembly of India.Furthermore, the Sachar Committee that is spoken of here is a panel that was set up by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to look into alleged Muslim deprivation and Syed Zafar Mahmood actually served in the Committee. Thus, he is promoting the recommendations of a committee he was himself a member of.The demand for delimitation was not limited to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and the negotiations thereof. This demand has been one which has been pushed by the Zakat Foundation since a long time. In fact, it is one of the tropes they use to tell IAS aspirants that they need to get into the bureaucracy so that they can make such demands a reality. In a presentation made by the Zakat Foundation President in the year 2016, he reveals that he had met erstwhile Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and demanded that before the 2014 elections, the LS seats should be delimited to ensure that more Muslims get elected to the Parliament. In 2013, when the 7th Pay Commission was announced, the Zakat Foundation made a representation to the then Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and asked if they Pay Commission can be implemented, then why not the Delimitation demands. Interestingly, Dr Manmohan Singh was reportedly “reminded” of this pending issue while Zakat Foundation had met him in the aftermath of the Muzaffarpur riots. According to a Times of India report, Zakat Foundation chief said, “The PM told us that in view of the upcoming election how can a delimitation commission be appointed now?”. It is to be noted that Mahmood was also the PM-appointed officer on special duty to the Sachar Committee. In 2013, Rahul Gandhi had held a detailed discussion with Muslim leaders from across the country. In this discussion, Rahul Gandhi had promised that the issue of delimitation of Muslim seats will be recommended to the committee and that he will also ensure that Congress adds this demand in their 2014 manifesto. The twocircles article says: The matter was raised during the meeting with Rahul Gandhi by Dr Syed. Zafar Mahmood, President, Zakat Foundation of India who presented 20 Works to be done for Muslims. These also include the establishment of fast track courts to deal with terror allegations, compensation of Rs 50 lakh to each person who is judicially acquitted of terror allegations, deletion of para 3 from the 1950 definition of scheduled caste, withdrawal of limited competitive examination scheme for recruitment of additional 1400 IPS officers, restoration of minority character of AMU. Essentially, if the Congress had come back to power in the year 2014 or 2019, delimitation of seats was a near certainly. This would mean far more Muslim representatives in the parliament and more importantly, the reservations being taken away from the SC/ST community. What is interesting to observe is that this demand is not very different from the demand of separate electorates made by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, a demand that was rejected by Jawaharlal Nehru. The demand for a separate electoral essentially meant that Jinnah believed Hindus and Muslims cannot co-exist and that Hindus were incapable of representing the interests of Muslims. This was a direct consequence of the two-nation theory that was espoused by Jinnah. That the Zakat Foundation is pursuing the demand for delimitation specifically of Muslim seats, while not exactly like demanding a separate electorate also points towards the same mindset.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.063,"negativity":0.07,"modiCount":3,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":9,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":59},{"content":"In a shocking revelation, it has been found that a staggering 221 people across the world have been killed by radical Islamists just in the first week of August, that is between August 1 and August 7, reported The Religion of Peace, a global Islamist crime watchdog.\n\nThe website stated that radical Islamists have carried out a total of 38 terror attacks within just 7 days of August in 11 countries.

To save both democracy and secularism, all other parties would have come together to form a government. Rahul Gandhi or a member of his family would have become Prime Minister. Or maybe the Congress would have won so few seats that the PM post would go to a third party with a 2-3% share of the national vote. Like I said, it is all about saving democracy. Narendra Modi would have become Leader of the Opposition. (Who would be health minister? It is impossible to say exactly, but my guess would be Lalu Yadav’s daughter “Dr.” Misa Bharti. Did you know that she topped the MBBS exam at Patna Medical College hospital when her parents were ruling Bihar? For some reason, this distinguished medical scholar does not appear to be practicing medicine.) Anyway. In that scenario, how do you think the media would be covering the pandemic right now? Let’s see: right now, you can go to mainstream or social media and find any number of taunts, jokes, jibes at PM Modi for the rising number of coronavirus cases in India. Would it have been the same if someone else had won the 2019 election? Perhaps. But consider this: along with what you see, take into account what you don’t see. Maharashtra is India’s number one state in terms of coronavirus case load. It has been so practically since the beginning. Other states have seen ups and downs, but in case of Maharashtra, there has no been no lull at any point. Just a constant surge. No let up in test positive rate either. It was over 22% yesterday. I challenge you to go to mainstream media right now and find one line of criticism against the way the Govt of Maharashtra has conducted itself in this pandemic. In fact, Shiv Sena MPs right now on Twitter are taking potshots at PM Modi over India reporting the highest number of virus cases in the world. No sense of irony about which state is reporting the highest number of virus cases in India. That is how comprehensive the clean chit given by the media to the MVA government. Imagine if such a formation was ruling India. Ok, but this is a pandemic. How can you blame individual state governments? But isn’t healthcare a state subject? It certainly is. And the media certainly brought this up, just in a different tone. Congratulations to the Maharashtra Chief Minister for making the war with Covid-19 look easy. You might notice that all seven Chief Ministers mentioned in the article just happen to be non-BJP Chief Ministers. Some people were so excited about the suddenly high profile role of state governments that they thought 2020 would be the year of the chief minister! Star Chief Ministers… Again, all of them non-BJP. Was there any state government which was vilified? Of course. At the time Rajdeep Sardesai wrote this article, Gujarat was number two in coronavirus cases in the country. Who was number 1? Never mind. So it’s not like they didn’t see the role of state governments. They just cheered non-BJP state governments early on. And savagely criticized the BJP ruled states. But as the pandemic progressed and it became clear the virus wasn’t going away any time soon, the media just fell silent. And pointed all its fingers at the Center. What began as the year for giving credit to Chief Ministers became a year where all the blame was put on the Prime Minister. For Uddhavsaheb, who went on to earn the tag of “best CM,” this turnaround in media perception must be particularly pleasing. Not long ago, the only party that was vilified in media more than BJP was perhaps the Shiv Sena. But he only had to sign the magical dotted line that made him an ally of 10 Janpath. And with that, all accusations against his politics went away. All questions about his governance style and performance disappeared into the void of Indian secularism. Our media is very forgiving. Then, the lockdown began and the migrant worker crisis gradually entered public consciousness. It started with thousands of workers in Delhi gathering on the UP border, unable to make a living in the capital any more. Interestingly, the media explained to us that the onus was not on the state they were fleeing from, i.e., Delhi. The onus was on the state they were fleeing to, i.e., Uttar Pradesh. This narrative was soon repeated nationwide. Migrant workers hungry in Maharashtra: why won’t Uttar Pradesh or Bihar take care of them? Then, the Central government began running special trains to take migrant workers back home. That’s when they blamed the Central government for running “Corona express” as part of a conspiracy to spread the virus in West Bengal. Oh, I’m sorry. Mamata didi never said “Corona express,” she said that the “people” called it that. Shame on “people.” Things have changed a lot since the early days of April and May. From number 2 at one point, Gujarat has steadily worked its way out of the swamp. As of now, it is not even in the top 10. The test positive rate has also dipped well below 2%. Since the beginning, Gujarat has seen 99,000 cases total, of which some 16000 remain active. For comparison, Kerala has seen 78,000 cases, of which some 22,000 remain active. Did you know that Gujarat has twice the population of Kerala? But Kerala is reducing testing aggressively. The other day, it only tested 11,000 people, finding about 1100 positive cases. A rate of 10% compared to under 2% for Gujarat. At this rate, if Kerala reduces testing to zero, it will certainly stay far behind Gujarat in number of total cases.Did I say Kerala? Did I say zero? It reminded me of this. That Hindu article dated May 5, 2020 is actually a little late in giving credit to Kerala for winning the war on Covid. This article in Quartz congratulated the Kerala government for winning the war on Feb 14 itself. Since then, Kerala’s legendary Health Minister Shailaja “Teacher” has been giving regular coaching classes to the world on how to stop the pandemic. In the process, she has collected so many awards and accolades that it would take too long to list them all. It is like being asked to make a list of all the great innings of Sachin Tendulkar. But as cases in Kerala kept surging, the media adulation slowly turned into silence. There was no follow up, no questioning about what Kerala did wrong. It seems Ravish Kumar gave up on his dream of a debate between Gujarat model and Kerala model. Earlier, he had asked if Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan should be made “captain” of India’s covid response. But for the most part, silence from the media on Kerala. Silence on Maharashtra and “best CM.” When things go wrong, the really fearless media chooses silence over dissent against ‘secular’ governments. In fact, silence has played a key role in India’s media history. Just before the 2014 election, the Congress ruled India for 10 straight years. This was the latest chunk in its near uninterrupted ~60 year rule out of 67 years of independence at that point. Can you imagine one of our fearless journalists sitting across from Sonia Gandhi and asking her these two questions: (1) Why is it that India’s per capita GDP crossed Pakistan’s per capita GDP only in 2007? Why did it take 60 years for the average Indian to catch up to the average Pakistani? (2) Why is it that less than 40% of Indian households in 2014 had access to toilets? Why were 3 crore households without electricity connections? Why did 15 crore households have no tap water? If Sonia Gandhi wouldn’t grant them an audience, they could have just put their questions out there. In their editorial columns, on their Facebook pages or Twitter timelines. They didn’t. They chose silence. Silence was the media’s favorite weapon for 67 years. They were silent during Lalu Yadav’s jungle raj in Bihar. They were silent when Mulayam Singh Yadav’s government allowed cheating in board exams in Uttar Pradesh. They were silent when Jyoti Basu’s government drove out all industry from Bengal and carried out massacres of political dissidents. They have questions only for Modi. So deafening is this silence that Rahul Gandhi can face the camera and boldly deny all responsibility for the actions of the Govt of Maharashtra, even though he has 10 Cabinet ministers in it.If Congress had won the 2019 election, suffice to say that we would have complete media silence on the pandemic right now. For 67 years, they could not ask why Indians don’t have toilets, gas, electricity or running water. They have broken their silence now. They are asking why India is unable to stop the pandemic. After all, France did it. The South Koreans did it a long time ago. The USA is slowly getting closer to doing it.

In 2019, Sonia Gandhi was made the interim president by the Congress Working Committee after Rahul Gandhi quit the post after the general elections fiasco. On Monday she would complete one year in office. The party claims that that the process to elect new chief has been postponed due to coronavirus pandemic and assured of complying with the provisions of the EC as soon as normalcy was restored. The Election Commission often stays away from interfering into the party’s internal issues. However, if it chooses, it can initiate action against any political party for failing to comply with the rules and regulations. The EC could also freeze the election symbol under the Symbol Order, which is an executive decision. The political parties are governed by Section 29 (A), sub-clause (V) of the Representation of People’s Act, introduced in 1989 to bring them under its ambit. Each political party, including the Congress, has to re-register itself, and agree to show its allegiance to the Constitution of India and participate in the periodic elections. Even though there are no rules for ensuring mandatory compliance, the Election Commission can time-and-again take a call on the matter, if and when, it deems appropriate. The EC may now examine if the INC Constitution has a specific provision regarding the election of a new president within a specified period after the incumbent vacates the post. The commission can order the party to hold the internal elections within this stipulated time frame. The worry for the grand-old-party is that the crisis within the party is likely to further deepen. The interim President Sonia Gandhi was recently admitted to the Ganga Ram hospital over some health complications. If she decides to go abroad for her annual medical check-up, the party may need to elect someone else in her place especially if Rahul Gandhi is reluctant to take charge. The president of the party can only be elected only by the All India Congress Committee. Meanwhile, the party cadres, including senior leaders of the party are demanding that the AICC should be convened at the earliest to fill up the key organisational position. They have also been asking for the reinstatement of the Congress Parliamentary Board, with a duly elected Working Committee, to provide representation to leaders who have a mass connect. Since multiple power centres have emerged, Congress party is currently highly vulnerable and susceptible to the machinations of the BJP, the Congress leaders believe since the current state of the organisation is both leaderless and directionless. While the Madhya Pradesh government collapsed earlier this year, the Rajasthan government is facing an existential crisis as well. There are also reports which indicate that the Chhattisgarh government may go the Madhya Pradesh way. The coalition government in Jharkhand also seems to have a bleak future. The BJP has been closely following the unfolding drama within the Congress and is waiting on the sidelines to take advantage of the unfurling situation. One of the outstanding issues with the Congress party is the indecisiveness of Rahul Gandhi. On one hand he has reportedly made it clear that he does not want to return as the party chief, on the other hand, he prefers to remain silent when his close associates raise demands for his reinstatement. Moreover, Sonia Gandhi’s health situation does not permit her to be pro-active as the president. Hence, the party may have to relieve her from many responsibilities in the larger interest of the organisation at the earliest. However, one of the major concerns has been that her her prolonged tenure has centralised the decision-making process. Most of the decisions of the party are made by her without any process of consultation. Prior to this, the Congress leaders apparently took decisions in consultation with the Congress Parliamentary Board. At one point, the CPB was an all-powerful body and each Rajya Sabha seat or that of the Legislative Council required its clearance. Contrastingly, the Congress party has done away with the CPB. Meanwhile the BJP has adopted the same with the Parliamentary Board of the party collectively arriving at important decisions with consultations. Ever since Sonia Gandhi took over the reins of the party, she has been the supreme leader. Apart from being the party president, she was also the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, the chairperson of the UPA and the head of the Election Committee and the Working Committee. She was also the convener of the National Advisory Council, during the UPA regime, which made her the de-facto Prime Minister. Some believe that such a concentration of authority and power has led to the decline of the party. In addition, her proclivity of favouring Dalits-Muslims over others fragmented and weakened the party. The senior leaders of the party are now in a view that, once Rahul Gandhi’s decision is known, the party should go ahead with the organisational elections and elect a non-Gandhi. In the interim, there could be either an arrangement of collective leadership or a leader with proven abilities and logistical skills such as Kamal Nath or Bhupinder Singh Hooda to be made the chief. The younger leaders can participate in the elections and therefore would discover their actual standing within the party. The leaders who win these election hurdles can be thus shortlisted as future leaders.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.12775,"negativity":0.041999999999999996,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":3,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":65},{"content":"The last week’s incident (October 16) where a high school teacher named Samuel Paty in Paris was beheaded by an Islamic fanatic for showing cartoons of prophet Mohammed to his students, has left the French people shocked.\n\nThe 18-year-old Muslim youth, a refugee from Chechnya, Russia had not only beheaded the teacher but also uploaded the gory pictures on Twitter, before being shot dead by the French police. Since then, French President Emmanuel Macron has described the incident as a terrorist attack. However, recently, an Islamic scholar went on to normalise this harrowing act by saying that the Muslim teen had not committed any serious crime.\n\nIn an interview to a Turkish TV channel, Sheikh Ali Al-Yousuf of the International Union of Muslim Scholars recently said that from the perspective of Islamic jurisprudence, the Chechen teen had “not done any serious crime”. According to the Islamic scholar, the teen did not do anything that offensive that he should be punished for according to the sharia law.\n\n‘The only punishment for insulting the Prophet is death’\nAccording to Al-Yousuf, the only punishment for insulting the Prophet is death. The only fault of the Muslin teen was that he carried out the punishment by himself. According to sharia, the punishment should be carried out by the Islamic State, said the Islamic scholar.\n\n“As I told you, if it is proven that the person who did this is a Chechen Muslim, and he did this out of anger because of the violation of the Prophet Muhammad’s honor, and if he indeed was a Muslim who did this in defense of the Islamic shari’a, then we let Allah be his judge. He may have carried out the punishment mandated by Islamic jurisprudence”.\n\nThe Islamic fundamentalist talking to the Turkey TV channel said that people should instead focus on the reason that forced the teen to do what he did. Normalising the crime committed by the 18-year-old teen, Al-Yousuf said that it was the growing ‘Islamophobia’ in France and elsewhere in the world which was prompting such extreme reactions, like in the case of the French teacher.\n\nBlames ‘Islamophobia’\n“Anyone who follows what is happening in France – the attacks against Islam and Muslims, and especially what we have seen lately – will see that there is an obvious media, political, cultural, and ideological campaign against Islam, Muslims, and the Prophet Muhammad, against every Muslim individual, as well as Muslim symbols, like the hijab. All this is crystal clear – it is called Islamophobia.\n\nThe Muslim scholar said that since Islam was the second-largest religion in France, and the number one religion in Europe, people in the West are insecure and think it must be attacked, They do not want Islam to advance in those places, opined Al-Yousuf.\n\n“I would like to say that in light of all these actions, we must take a look at those who incite and distort and those who attack our Prophet Muhammad, in a country that claims to be secular and democratic, a country that claims to respect human rights, religions, opinions, and ideas. I do not know what kind of respect this is with this cursing, insulting, and attacking of Islamic symbols. This is the problem. Before we talk about this act (the murder of Samuel Paty), its judgement according to the sharia and our opinion about it… We must firmly focus on all the hostile and disgraceful actions that have been directed against Muslims for many years, actions supported by the government and extremists in France and elsewhere that were meant to distort Islam’s image in the West,” he furthered.\n\n‘Decapitation is the punishment of blasphemers’, Islamists in Pakistan after the Charlie Hebdo incident\nThis reaction from the fundamentalist, however, does not come as a surprise. The reprinting of the cartoons on Mohammad by Charlie Hebdo had also attracted similar reactions from Islamists worldwide. Last month, Pakistan witnessed protests by tens of thousands of Muslims, soon after Charlie Hebdo decided to reprint cartoons mocking Prophet Mohammad, which prompted Islamic terrorists to launch a terror attack against them in 2015. “Death to France” was chanted and the protesters called for a boycott of French products. Protestors had put out posters which read: “Decapitation is the punishment of blasphemers.”\n\nIndian Islamists had marched demanding decapitation of Kamlesh Tiwari\nBack in 2015, lakhs of Islamists in India, openly supported by Islamist organisations, religious leaders and politicians, had marched on the streets demanding the beheading of Kamlesh Tiwari, a former Hindu Maha Sabha leader who had commented on the sexuality of Mohammad. Tiwari was charged under the NSA by the then state government in UP and jailed for several months. In 2019, some Islamists had entered into his office and stabbed, shot him to death, fulfilling the long-standing demand by Islamists that anyone who ‘insults’ their prophet should be beheaded.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.047,"negativity":0.1775,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":4,"pakistanCount":2,"_deepnote_index_column":66},{"content":"Ancient Wisdom dictates that nothing succeeds like success. Quite obviously, the converse also holds true. Nothing defeats like defeat. In the aftermath of a defeat, people are prone to making mistakes that could trap them in a vicious cycle of defeat. A similar pattern is unfolding before our eyes following the spectacular failure of the Liberal Establishment’s anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (anti-CAA) campaign. For the first time in a long time, we witnessed the public collaboration between opposition parties, the mainstream media, the Far-Left mafia in Universities and Muslim Extremists on the streets engaging in rampant mob violence. While the strength of the alliance came mainly from Muslim extremists, they were also the greatest liability for the other camps as the public demonstration of Islamic extremism only worked towards consolidating public opinion in favour of the government. To be sure, it was a very volatile alliance from the very beginning. Unlike the Hindutva camp, which is united by shared blood, history, culture, traditions and heritage, it’s only opportunism that is holding the Liberal Establishment together. The Opposition parties tolerate Islamic Extremism as it fetches them votes. The mainstream media largely acts as the propaganda wing of the Opposition parties. It’s only the Far-Left Mafia in Universities that sympathize with Islamic Extremists as the former is stupid enough to believe that the latter has genuine grievances and both of them share the same hatred towards the Hindu Samaj. Moreover, in Urban areas, Muslim mobs provide the Leftist intelligentsia with the muscle power that it desires. It was only the promise of a victory that was holding them all together. However, since the General Elections of 2019, it has been one defeat after another and the CAA was the last straw. The Liberal Establishment decided to mount one final push but it, too, did not achieve the desired results. Let us be clear here, the anti-CAA protests were a catastrophic defeat for the Liberal Establishment. Public opinion has definitively consolidated behind the government and the Establishment is recognizing this. Thus, we are witnessing this alliance of opportunism fall apart right before our very eyes as every distinct group looks to preserve their own interests. It is quite unlike the Hindutva alliance where every subgroup realizes that it floats and sinks as a collective. Here, it is just an alliance of convenience. When confronted with a defeat, every subgroup of the Liberal Establishment looks to secure its own interests first. And that is how the carefully constructed alliance unravels. The first instance of it was demonstrated when Aysha Renna, one of the faces of the Jamia protests and someone who has supported terrorist Yakub Memon in the past, was heckled by Communists after she spoke out against Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan. She was forced to issue a public apology over her remark against Vijayan. The second instance was when senior Congress leader Shashti Tharoor spoke out against the rampant display of Islamic Extremism in the anti-CAA protests and was thoroughly rebuked by the new leaders of the Muslim community. Tharoor had only remarked that the slogans of “There is no God but Allah” went against the ethos of pluralism and diversity they were trying to protect. Shashi Tharoor’s comments was an act of self-preservation by the Congress party. The party realized that the overt display of Islamic Extremism could cost them a lot in future elections and hence, had to disassociate themselves from it. But the new Muslim leaders stepped in and these new leaders are now trying to assume the leadership of the Muslim community and ensure that the votes do not continue to flow in the account of the ‘secular’ parties anymore. Shehla Rashid stepped in and claimed that the anti-CAA protests were a Muslim struggle and it was the liberals who were trying to hijack their movement. The message was clear, the new Muslim leader no longer wants to outsource the leadership of the community to the ‘secular’ parties. They now want to become the face of the community and their political representatives themselves. The hardline stance by Shehla Rashid and other Muslims has forced Shashi Tharoor to backtrack from his earlier statement regarding Muslim extremism because at the end of the day, the ‘secular’ parties desperately need the Muslim votes to stay relevant. The Congress party is now stuck between a hard place and a rock. There is no good outcome for them out of this. Meanwhile, Shehla Rashid’s stance doesn’t appear to be particularly smart as well considering the fact that Muslim identity politics will hugely consolidate support for the BJP and there’s no good thing that could possibly come of this. The slogans of “Ladhke lenge Azadi” and “Chheen ke lengey Azadi” ended up with one Muslim protester shitting his pants quite literally. As crude as it may sound, it’s the truth. Furthermore, the demonstration of Muslim Extremism during the anti-CAA protests gave the BJP governments sufficient leeway to brutally put down the protests. In the end, the Maulanas were left begging for mercy and tons of others were left with severe injuries that would take a long time to heal. The major lesson to learn is this: Muslim identity politics will no longer work in India. The people of this country have decided it is not something that they will tolerate any longer. Therefore, any attempt at Muslim identity politics will only benefit the BJP and give them more leeway in dealing with any potential outburst of violence. Worryingly enough, Shehla Rashid also appears to have delivered the final nail in the coffin for the Dalit-Muslim Unity Project. She is now advocating for the invasion of Muslims into benefits reserved for the Dalit community. She claims ‘Dalit Muslims’ should be granted the opportunity to receive benefits under reservations for the Dalit Community. In reality, there is nothing called Dalit Muslims. As ‘Eminent Historians’ keep telling us, Caste is intrinsic to only the Hindu faith and the egalitarian nature of Islam is what forced many to convert in order to escape the oppressive caste system. Therefore, people cannot turn around now and claim that caste is a feature of the Muslim community too. More fundamentally, Shehla Rashid’s demands mean that Dalits will now have to sacrifice their share of reservations and accommodate Muslims in order to achieve Dalit-Muslim Unity. The Dalit Community was already turning more and more towards Hindutva and this demand by Shehla Rashid, that Dalits sacrifice a portion of their reservations for Muslims, will further drive a wedge between the two communities. All in all, the entire edifice of the Liberal Establishment is crumbling apart and every group is struggling to preserve their own interests at the expense of the other. Liberals thought they could milk Islamic Extremism for votes. The Islamic Extremists believe they could use Liberals to further their own extremist agenda. The Leftist intelligentsia was under the illusion that it could be used to usher in an era of revolution where unicorns farted rainbows. At the end of it all, however, the only one that gets to benefit from all of this is the BJP. Members of the ruling dispensation must be watching all the events unfold with popcorn in their hands.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.102,"negativity":0.0805,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":4,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":3,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":67},{"content":"The radical Islamic organization Popular Front of India (PFI) has heaped praises on the Congress party after the Chhattisgarh government approached the Supreme Court demanding the declaration of NIA Act of 2008 as unconstitutional.

In a statement issued by PFI, they said that PFI national general secretary M Mohammed Ali Jinnah welcomed the Chhatisgarh government’s decision and urged the other non-BJP governments to approach the Supreme Court as well. Jinnah said that the law was against the “spirit of federalism”. Another government that received great compliments from the PFI was Pinarayi Vijayan’s government in Kerala.

A series of policy pledges to tackle what he calls Islamic separatism.\n\nIncidentally, the day that Macron chose for this announcement was Oct 2. It is not clear whether the French President meant this deliberately as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. However, two things are clear. First, the speech involves a level of plain speaking that is quite unusual for a head of state. Second, the speech completely changes the way France (and potentially the rest of Europe and even the West) looks at Islam.\n\nThe following is a collection of some of the upshots from the speech, translated loosely into English. We shall not go into details of his policy announcements, which are very specific to domestic governance in France. Rather, we will look at the introduction to the speech, where Macron explains what he has set out to do and why. The full text of the nearly hour long speech, in French, is available from the French Government website [pdf].\n\n“Who has put the Republic in danger?”\n\nThe French President lays it out thus:\n\n“There are two objectives for why I am speaking to you today. The first is to define the reality of our problems without any taboos. Who is it today, in our society, that has put our Republic in danger and our ability to coexist? The second is to share with you the decisions made by the government on how to tackle the situation. These decisions are the result of careful consideration of nearly 3 years.”\n\n“The problem is not secularism”\n\nThe President laid this out firmly:\n\n“The problem is not secularism. I have said many times that secularism in France means the freedom to believe or not to believe and to worship however you want, subject to public order. Secularism means the neutrality of the state and does not mean that religion must be erased from the public sphere. Secularism is the glue that holds France together.”\n\nIn France, they take secularism (in French: laïcité) with overwhelming seriousness. The state maintains the strictest possible distance from religion, bans all religious symbols in government buildings including public schools and forbids public servants from wearing them.\n\nA bit of historical context is needed here. The French Revolution saw religious authorities as part of the complex that supported the tyranny of the king. The 1789 revolution was followed with the Declaration of the Rights of Man. It explicitly rejected religion as the basis of government and laid the foundation for modern secular law. At the time, the US had just finished fighting the revolutionary war, in which France had been their ally against British colonial rule. The Declaration inspired the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution and was also the basis of the UN’s declaration of universal human rights in the 20th century.\n\n“Islamic separatism aims to form a counter-society“\n\nThe President describes his opponent thus:\n\n“It is Islamic separatism that we have to attack. Islamic separatism is a conscious effort, a politico-religious one. It repeatedly breaks with the values of the Republic and aims to form a counter-society. This takes the form of taking kids out of school, developing sports and cultural communities that become an excuse for teaching principles that do not conform to the laws of the Republic. This indoctrination negates our principles such as equality of men and women and the dignity of the human being.“\n\nA “counter-society” that does not respect the dignity of the individual. Ouch!\n\n“First it forms a parallel society, but its ultimate aim is to take over“\n\nThe President explains further:\n\n“The problem is this ideology which believes that its laws are superior to those of the Republic. I have often said that people are free to believe or not to believe, but every citizen, with or without religious belief, must absolutely respect the laws of the Republic. And let us name it and tackle it : it is in Islamic separatism that we find a desire and a methodical organization to destroy the laws of the Republic and create in its place a parallel system, based on different values and a different organization of society. At first, this is only a parallel society, but the ultimate aim is to take control of everything.“\n\nI warned you. This level of plain speaking is unusual for a modern head of state.\n\n“Islam is in crisis all over the world“\n\nThe President gave his personal view\n\n“A lot has been written, said and analyzed in this regard, about what our country is facing right now. I have the humility to admit that I am no specialist, but let me tell you in a few words what I think. Islam is a religion which is in crisis all over the world. This is not just happening in France, this hardening of attitudes is happening all over the world, including in countries where Islam is the majority religion. Just see the example of our friend Tunisia, how different it was thirty years ago. And Tunisia is one of the most educated and developed in that part of the world….“\n\nAnd with this, President Macron went on to lay out his ideas for tackling the problem as he saw it. For instance, requiring that all kids must attend public school, instead of possible indoctrination via “home schooling.” Closing down places of worship that are suspected of spreading radicalization. A national effort to shut down establishments that have practices that violate core French values, such as gender equality, for example by having different times for men and women to use a swimming pool. He would also crack the whip on elected officials, who might “compromise” on these values in certain neighborhoods, due to pressure from the local public.\n\nWhile Macron’s speech did not receive the kind of attention you would expect, possibly due to English being the language of global discourse, the usual suspects did cry out.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.056,"negativity":0.06575,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":2,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":74},{"content":"The Delhi elections are only five days away. With the elections campaigns reaching a feverish pitch, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath gave an interview to BBC. He has been campaigning in Delhi for the BJP and his remarks in his rallies have attracted a lot of attention. As expected, the Saffron-clad Mahant of Gorakhnath Muth was asked some pointed questions by the BBC on the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC. The BBC asked Yogi Adityanath if it wasn’t true that the Muslims protesting against the CAA and NRC today are the descendants of those who had rejected moving to Pakistan in 1947, a country that was created on the basis of religion. The Chief Minister of UP responded by saying that they hadn’t done India any favour by choosing to remain in India. Yogi Adityanath said, “They hadn’t done any favour. They hadn’t done any favour to India. When India was partitioned, it should have been opposed. Arguments in favour of India must be supported. Those which are against India must be opposed. This is what our nationalism says and it is also the duty of every Indian citizen.” It is pertinent to mention here that Sharjeel Imam, the mastermind of the Shaheen Bagh protests who urged Muslims to cut off North East India from the rest of the country indefinitely, had said that Muslims did not choose to stay in India due to secularism or any such thing. He had said that Muslims chose to stay in India due to their property and other reasons. The BBC has a history of dubious reporting about India.

The Diyanet is state body for administration of religious affairs and answers directly to Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe Diyanet reportedly has an annual budget of over €1 billion ($1.17 billion), which is more than Turkey’s Interior or Foreign Ministry.\n\nIn March this year, the German federal state of Hesse ended its cooperation with DITIB because they had doubts of DITIB’s independence from Turkish state. In May 2019, former German intelligence chief had alleged that the DITIB Imams are working for the Turkish intelligence. In January 2019, German media reported that the organisation had close contacts with alleged Islamists of Muslim Brotherhood in Germany.\n\nFrance vs Turkey\nDays after French President made the ‘Islam is in crisis’ speech calling out Islamic terrorism, Turkey President Erdogan had said that Macron needs ‘treatment’. Days later, a French teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded for showing a Charlie Hebdo caricature of Prophet Muhammad to his class. This was followed by other beheadings by terrorists shouting Allahu Akbar as France continued to call out Islamic terror attack.\n\nAmid such terror attacks, Turkish media has cited Turkish Muslim group accused of espionage, on reports of ‘pig’s head found in mosque’ in France.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.034,"negativity":0.11049999999999999,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":4,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":76},{"content":"While inaugurating various Namami Gange projects in Uttarakhand via video conferencing, PM Modi launched a scathing attack on the opposition, especially Congress for protesting against several bills introduced during the recently concluded Parliament session including the Farm Bills. PM Modi said that the nation can see how they are opposing the reforms without any reason. He said that those opposing the Farm Bills do not want the farmers to sell their produce in open market instead they want the middleman to earn profit. He added that they are opposing the freedom of farmers. “They set fire to the equipments farmers worship,” PM Modi added calling out Punjab Youth Congress’ stunt of setting the tractor on fire in Delhi. He added that the previous Congress governments did not implementing the MSP and broke their promise. He said that the current government acted on the recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission and implemented the MSP. Accusing the opposition of misleading the farmers, PM Modi said that the people lamenting the farm reforms because the source of their black money will be finished after the reforms. PM Modi took a dig at the Congress party for ignoring the demands of the Air Force for Rafale aircraft. He said that the previous Congress governments did nothing for empowering our security forces. He remined how the opposition had shown their “intention” before the country by questioning the surgical strike carried out by our security forces on Pakistan. He also recalled how the opposition had opposed Yoga in India while the world was celebrating the International Yoga Day and that how they had also opposed the Statue of Unity dedicated to national leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He said that no opposition has visited the Statue of Unity. PM Modi said that the people opposing reforms for the sake of doing it are losing relevance day by day. He recalled how they had opposed the Bhum Pujan of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya after opposing it in the Supreme Court. Attacking the Congress party, PM Modi said there are several smaller political parties in the country that never formed a government or been a part of the government and yet they never worked against the interests of the country but some parties that have been opposition for a very short time are behaving like this. Prime Minister Narendra Modi today spoke via video conference at the occasion of inauguration of development projects in Uttarakhand. PM Modi inaugurated six mega projects under the Namami Gange Mission in Uttarakhand. The projects include the construction of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with 68 Million litres per day (MLD) capacity, construction of an 18 MLD STP at Sarai in Haridwar, upgradation of the existing 27 MLD STP at Jagjeertpur, Haridwar and the inauguration of 26 MLD STP at Lakkadghat in Hrishikesh along with a 5 MLD STP at Chorpani and two STPs having capacities of 1 MLD and 0.01 MLD at Badrinath. The PM also unveiled that logo fo Jal Jeevan Mission and Margadarshika for village panchayats and Paani Samitis under the Namami Gange Mission. He also inaugurated the first museum on Ganga called Ganga Avalokan at Chandi Ghat, Hariswar which will showcase the culture, biodiversity and rejuvenation activities done in the river. Thirty projects have been completed in Uttarakhand so far.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.077,"negativity":0.04375,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":1,"_deepnote_index_column":77},{"content":"In 1947, the Indian subcontinent was partitioned into 2 countries- India and Pakistan, with India meant for Hindus and Pakistan for the Muslims. The British gave the remaining princely states a choice to merge with either unions or stay independent. One of the largest princely states within the Indian union was Hyderabad, a Hindu-majority region ruled by a Muslim Nizam.\n\nThe Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, was in a dilemma on whether he should join the Indian union or stay independent. On the other hand, the Majlis-e-Itihadul Muslimeen (precursor of present-day AIMIM) was adamant on the Nizam merging with Pakistan instead of being Independent. Being no more than a puppet to the MIM, the Nizam agreed to keep Hyderabad independent of either unions.\n\nThough the Nizam tried to legitimise the Princely state of Hyderabad by appointing trade officials in European countries and sending delegations to the UNSC, there were civil movements within his territory led by Arya Samaj, Hindu Mahasabha and Hyderabad State Congress to fight for Hindu rights in Hyderabad and merge the state with the Indian Union.\n\nFearing an uprising by the majority-Hindu community of the Hyderabad State, the Nizam sanctioned the creation of Razakars led by Kasim Razvi, which was to be a paramilitary wing of the MIM. The Nizam gave Razakars the power to suppress Hindu uprisings and movements by whatever means possible, in a bid to save his own skin.\n\nThe Razakars, after getting the green signal from the Nizam, started an ethnic genocide of Hindus in Rural Telangana (which is predominantly Hindu). The Razakars were committed to mass conversions of Hindus to Islam in an attempt to make Hyderabad a Muslim majority province. The Razakars went village-to-village and mass-murdered, raped and kidnapped several Hindu villagers.\n\nOne such incident is that of Veera Bairanpalli, a village in Telangana which was at the receiving end of the Razakars. The Jihadi forces had tried to enter the village to mass convert Hindu residents thrice, but were unsuccessful when the residents chased the invaders with slings and other crude weapons.\n\nHowever, the Razakars led by Kasim Razvi managed to infiltrate the village with the help of the Nizam on their fourth attempt during the festival of Bathukamma. At the borders of the village lied a mud fort which the villagers used to guard themselves from the Jihadis, the Razakars shot all the guards at point blank range and proceeded to massacre the unarmed villagers.\n\nOn entering the village premises, the Razakars stripped Hindu girls off their clothes and paraded them naked, followed by making them dance to their tunes as a sign of submission and surrender to Islamic superiority. Hindu women were raped mercilessly with the men shot dead. Several villagers jumped into open wells present in agricultural fields to escape the terror. Many temples were also plundered by the Razakars.\n\nRecently, The Hindu interviewed an 80 year old Charan Chandra Reddy who is one of the sole survivors of the massacre. At the time of Jihadi invasion, Reddy was a guard posted at the mud fort bordering the village and had narrowly escaped getting killed. “The Razakars killed 96 people in Bhairanpally that day. They raped women, paraded them naked and snatched away gold ornaments from them. As the brutes chased, the villagers ran helter skelter and some even died jumping into the open wells in agricultural fields,” Reddy told The Hindu in 2017.\n\nSome of the Razakar forces were shot dead by the villagers, which enraged Kasim Razvi and escalated the massacre. The Razakars rounded up the villagers and shot them dead after lining them up, in an attempt to save bullets. A survivor of this incident, N. Mallaiah, told The Hindu in 2016, “They plundered everything. The armed men molested women, killed sheep and killed able-bodied men just for pleasure. They looted every village en route.”\n\n“To save bullets, they lined us up and shot. The bullet missed me and went through my left hand. Thinking that I am dead, they threw me on the heap of dead bodies”, he further said. A resident named Dasari Pulliah added to Mallaiah’s statement, “Many of us climbed onto the mud fort which has been there since times immemorial. We took shelter and fired at the Razakars. We killed some of them and that enraged Kazim Rizvi who was controlling the Razakars”.\n\nA similar incident happened at Perumandla Sankeesa, a village in the Warangal district of Telangana. Between 1947-1948, the Razakars invaded the village three times with ecalating wrath each time they attacked the village. On 1st September 1948, the village saw the most bloodthirsty form of the Razakars, who came looking for the guerrilla forces that attacked the Nizam’s officials regularly and hid in the forests surrounding the village. The Jihadi army tortured villagers while interrogating them about the whereabouts of the guerrilla leaders and raped Hindu women under broad daylight.\n\nOne of the villagers who survived the attack was Chitti Komalu, a 99 year old resident of the village who gave an interview to The Hindu on the Razakar attacks. He was quoted saying, “The Razakars raided our village three times in six months in 1947 and 1948. I was caught alive and hanged upside down. They tortured me seeking the whereabouts of Thumma Seshaih, the commander of armed squad in this area. I was sent to jail for one and half years at Warangal, Gulbarge and Jalna. I was released after six months of police action that led to Telangana liberation and merger with Indian Union”.\n\n“Women ran away on seeing the Razakars and hid in maize fields. But they were chased and hunted down by the Razakars and raped openly in broad daylight,” he further said.\n\nThe Razakars continued their barbaric campaign till the Indian army routed their forces with Operation Polo in 1948, leading to the liberation of Hyderabad from Nizam’s control and accession to the Indian Union. These incidents highlight the sacrifices made by Telangana villagers to ensure the survival of Hinduism in present day Telangana. Remembering their sacrifices will honour those who lost their lives in these barbaric attempts to erase Hinduism from the face of Deccan India.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.058,"negativity":0.0865,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":1,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":3,"_deepnote_index_column":78}],"rows_bottom":null},"text/plain":"                                              content  nationalist  \\\n0   The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its ver...          0.0   \n1    A day after former Union minister Jaswant Sin...          0.0   \n2      (BJP) has got down to the exercise of regai...          0.0   \n3   The whispers have started: “If not Narendra Mo...          0.0   \n4   Going into the last full Union Budget of his t...          0.0   \n..                                                ...          ...   \n74  Earlier this month, the French President Emman...          1.0   \n75  The Delhi elections are only five days away.

The BJP leaders informed the governor that Y Patton had been elected the BJP Legislature Party leader in the Assembly. National People's Party's (NPP) state president Ato Yepthomi said he had also submitted a letter supporting Rio to the governor. The governor has asked him to give a letter of support signed by the party's national president Conrad Sangma along with a letter with the signatures of both the NPP MLAs at the earliest.

The NDPP-BJP alliance cornered 30 seats and has the support of two NPP MLAs, one JD(U) MLA and an Independent. Outgoing Chief Minister TR Zeliang submitted his resignation which the governor accepted and asked him to continue in office till an alternative arrangement was made. Earlier in the day, officials from the Election Commission along with state Chief Electoral Officer Abhijit Sinha submitted a notification constituting the 13th Nagaland Legislative Assembly to the governor. The governor dissolved the 12th Nagaland Legislative Assembly, the source said.","count":1},{"name":" In a scathing attack on the Siddaramaiah government, former prime minister HD Deve Gowda on Friday described it as the \"most corrupt\" administration the state has ever seen. People would teach a lesson to the chief minister whose intention was to \"finish off\" JDS, he said. The JDS supremo claimed that Siddaramaiah was \"staring\" at defeat in his own constituency of Chamundeshwari in Mysuru in the 12 May assembly polls. Gowda, in an interview to  , dismissed speculation that the polls might throw up a hung assembly. He maintained that JDS' alliance with Mayawati's BSP and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had only brightened the JDS' electoral prospects. \"If Siddaramaiah has to contest from a particular constituency, he has to nurture it. He did not. He just began paying visits to Chamundeshwari for the last three months. This will not work. Defeat is staring at Siddaramaiah's face,\" Gowda said. Gowda said people vote for leaders who keep society together and do not divide as Siddaramaiah had done by proposing a separate religious minority tag for Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats. He claimed Siddaramaiah's attempts to contest from two constituencies had created a negative perception about him. \"Siddaramaiah's attempts to contest also from Badami constituency, have created a public perception that the Chief Minister is not confident of winning Chamundeshwari seat...Our candidate, G T Deve Gowda, is a formidable candidate. He will defeat him,\" he said. The Congress has announced that Siddaramaiah would contest from Chamundeshwari, amid reports that he is still keeping the option open to contest from Badami in north Karnataka, which is perceived to be a safer seat. Reports suggest Siddaramaiah would face a tough battle in Chamundeshwari, with JDS going all out to scuttle his chances. \"People also will teach a lesson to Siddaramaiah, whose intention is to finish off JDS, which nurtured him in his political career earlier,\" said Gowda for whom the chief minister, formerly a JDS leader, has become a bitter rival. To a query on Siddaramaiah's five-year rule, Gowda said \"it is the most corrupt government the state had.\" \"I do not want to list the number of corruption charges against his government. There are many. People know,\" he said. To a query, Gowda said he was not expecting a hung assembly. \"There are certain things which have brightened the prospects of JDS, like our association with Mayawati's BSP, KCR's party and Assaduddin Owaisi. We are working hard, and there is no question of a hung assembly,\" he said. People would vote for JDS as they have seen the \"misrule\" of Congress and BJP in the last ten years, Gowda said. He said people were wise enough to vote for clean candidates, unlike some candidates fielded by the BJP and Congress who were facing graft charges. \"The end result will be different. People understand the misrule of Congress and BJP for the last ten years. Just look at the candidates they have fielded... People are wise. Will they vote for such candidates?\" he said. Asked if the Lingayat controversy would benefit the Congress, Gowda said it is a wrong calculation because the community is very \"well-inclined\" in politics and would not like to lose its political clout. \"However, it is very difficult to assess whom Lingayats would vote for.\" On allegations he is soft on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gowda said he would not attack him needlessly. \"I do not want attack anybody needlessly..whatever may be Modi and Amit Shah's strategy to win elections,\" he said. Gowda said he would not criticise the prime minister, unless he traded charges against him. \"Why should I scratch my head and pounce on them,\" he said. On Rahul Gandhi's dubbing JDS as \"Team B\" of BJP, Gowda said he was not going to use harsh words against him because \"he is still young\". \"Some people try to mislead him .... he should not get tempted over such things...he is still young. I am not going to use any harsh words against him,\" he added. To another question, Gowda said he was least bothered about Congress and BJP perceiving JDS as an irrelevant party. \"Let them have the impression that my party is an irrelevant party in this election. Let them have it till May 15 (counting of votes). I am least bothered,\" he said. Gowda said he is ready to give tickets to disgruntled leaders belonging to Congress or BJP, who have been ignored by their parties, after considering their chances of winning.","count":1},{"name":"19

People would teach a lesson to the chief minister whose intention was to \"finish off\" JDS, he said. The JDS supremo claimed that Siddaramaiah was \"staring\" at defeat in his own constituency of Chamundeshwari in Mysuru in the 12 May assembly polls. Gowda, in an interview to  , dismissed speculation that the polls might throw up a hung assembly. He maintained that JDS' alliance with Mayawati's BSP and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had only brightened the JDS' electoral prospects. \"If Siddaramaiah has to contest from a particular constituency, he has to nurture it. He did not. He just began paying visits to Chamundeshwari for the last three months. This will not work. Defeat is staring at Siddaramaiah's face,\" Gowda said. Gowda said people vote for leaders who keep society together and do not divide as Siddaramaiah had done by proposing a separate religious minority tag for Lingayats and Veerashaiva Lingayats. He claimed Siddaramaiah's attempts to contest from two constituencies had created a negative perception about him. \"Siddaramaiah's attempts to contest also from Badami constituency, have created a public perception that the Chief Minister is not confident of winning Chamundeshwari seat...Our candidate, G T Deve Gowda, is a formidable candidate. He will defeat him,\" he said. The Congress has announced that Siddaramaiah would contest from Chamundeshwari, amid reports that he is still keeping the option open to contest from Badami in north Karnataka, which is perceived to be a safer seat. Reports suggest Siddaramaiah would face a tough battle in Chamundeshwari, with JDS going all out to scuttle his chances. \"People also will teach a lesson to Siddaramaiah, whose intention is to finish off JDS, which nurtured him in his political career earlier,\" said Gowda for whom the chief minister, formerly a JDS leader, has become a bitter rival. To a query on Siddaramaiah's five-year rule, Gowda said \"it is the most corrupt government the state had.\" \"I do not want to list the number of corruption charges against his government. There are many. People know,\" he said. To a query, Gowda said he was not expecting a hung assembly. \"There are certain things which have brightened the prospects of JDS, like our association with Mayawati's BSP, KCR's party and Assaduddin Owaisi. We are working hard, and there is no question of a hung assembly,\" he said. People would vote for JDS as they have seen the \"misrule\" of Congress and BJP in the last ten years, Gowda said.

The history of 200 years is seen as a metaphor of Dalit triumph against the caste-based tyranny during the Peshwa rule. The violence in Pune on Monday resulted in the death of one and vandalising of several vehicles that were stranded on the Pune highway for hours. Violent reactions were also reported from Aurangabad and other parts of the state. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and the Congress have alleged the role of right-wing organisations in the violence, calling it a pre-meditated attack. The violence and the subsequent political reactions though are obvious. The root cause of the incident can be traced to the interpretation of Maratha history. Broadly speaking there are two school of thoughts that decipher the Maratha history. A section of historians have portrayed Shivaji as a Hindutva icon who fought the Islamic aggression of Mughals. Another section, mostly Dalit historians, believes that Shivaji was a \"Bahujan\" ruler who was subjected to humiliation by the upper caste Brahmins. The right-wing portrayal of Shivaji is that of \"Hindavi Swarajya Sansthapak\" (the founder of Hindu kingdom), and \"Gau-Brahman prati palak\" (the protector of cows and Brahmins) while the other section call Shivaji as \"Rayate cha Raja\" (king of the ryots). \r\n \r\n Shivaji's kingdom after his death was caught in a family feud and was further handled by the Peshwas, who were upper caste Brahmins and the prime minister in Shivaji's cabinet. After achieving glory during Peshwa Bajirao I's rule (where the Peshwas extended their rule beyond Attock, now in Pakistan) the Peshwa rule became notorious for its Casteist rule. The Peshwa rule or Peshwai, as it was called, came to an end in 1818, mainly after the battle of Bhima Koregaon. A small battalion of the British East India company, mostly comprising soldiers belonging to the Mahar caste fought the mighty army of 28,000 Peshwa soldiers. The Bhima Koregaon battle, more than a fight of supremacy, has been seen as a symbol of uprising against the Peshwa tyranny against lower castes. Ever since, the interpretation of history has not only been at the centre of academic debate, but also a boiling socio-political issue. Although there has been undercurrents in Maharashtra's political circle, lately after the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis (a Brahmin) has come to power, agitations with historic connotations are on the rise. Immediately after the BJP came to power, Fadnavis was at the receiving end for conferring the state's highest Maharashtra Bhushan award to historian  . Maratha organisations for years have alleged that Purandare was responsible for the Brahmanisation of Maratha history. In 2004, Pune's Bhandarkar Institute was vandalised by Maratha organisations alleging that American researcher James Laine had portrayed Shivaji and his mother in bad light. This has led to the banning of the book. But since then, Maratha organisations suc as Sambhaji Brigade and Maratha Mahasangh have been at the forefront of aggressive Maratha agenda. So in 2014, when a Brahmin Devendra Fadnavis became the chief minister, it was likened to the rule of Peshwa. Similarly like the Purandare episode, Maratha organisations uprooted a statue of renowned  from Pune's Sambhaji Park. The allegation was yet again the same, wrong portrayal of Sambhaji through a Brahminical prism. The Brahmin versus Maratha socio-political conflict had a third angle of the Dalits. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar calling for annihilation of caste burnt the copies of Manu Smriti. Anti-Brahmin tone has been the main ingredient of the Maratha and Dalit movements. Although the struggle was targeted at Brahmnin upper caste hegemony, clashes have been noted only between the Marathas and Dalits. Violence between Brahmins and Dalits, or Brahmins and Marathas have hardly been noted. Although the Brahmin community remains a meagre three per cent of the state's population and politically uninfluential in Maharashtra (unlike Uttar Pradesh), they still have been at the centre stage of such agitations. Maratha organisations took to the streets after a girl from the community was raped and murdered in Kopardi. There were mammoth rallies by the community to demand justice for the victim and also reservation for the community. The massive Maratha morchas also had an undertone of anti-Dalit sentiment as the accused in the case were  . The Maratha and Dalit communities indulged in major violence and bitterness in the 1980s when former CM Sharad Pawar announced the renaming of Marathwada University as Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. The latest incident is yet another case of the strange history of clashes - while the Mahar battalion fought an army of Peshwas, the latest clashes have been reported between Marathas and Dalits. The violence will undoubtedly have its own political ramifications. But it has once again brought to the fore the complex caste cauldron in Maharashtra politics.  ","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.0425,"negativity":0.13075,"modiCount":2,"bjpCount":2,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":1,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":1,"_deepnote_index_column":2},{"content":"The Crime Investigation Department of the Gujarat Police on Wednesday arrested former Indian Police Service officer Sanjiv Bhatt for allegedly planting drugs on a lawyer who was held from Palanpur in Banaskantha district in 1996,   reported.

The district police led by Bhatt had arrested Sumersingh Rajpurohit for possessing around a kilogramme of opium. The police had claimed the drugs were found in a hotel room occupied by Rajpurohit in Palanpur.  However, the Rajasthan Police later concluded that Rajpurohit had been falsely implicated by Bhatt and other police officers.

At a marriage function in Chennai, Stalin asked parents to name their children with “beautiful Tamil names”. He cited the example of his own family, where everyone except him, was given a Tamil name.  “My father wanted to name me Ayyadurai, because social reformer Periyar was referred to as Ayya and Durai was the name of DMK founder CN Annadurai. But the day I was born, my father was attending a condolence meeting of Russian leader Joseph Stalin. When he was informed of my birth while on stage, he instantly announced he was naming me after Stalin,” revealed the DMK working president.   Stalin wasn't merely regaling the audience with a story. The attempt is to subtly contrast it with Delhi's lack of enthusiasm for Tamil. This comes at a time, when the Centre, in a reply to a question in Parliament, reiterated the position of the Supreme Court that had ruled in 2012 that Tamil cannot be the official language of the Madras High Court. It may be noted that in 2006, when Karunanidhi was the CM, the Tamil Nadu Assembly assed a resolution, urging the Centre to get Presidential assent to make Tamil the official language in the high court.  In the last 24 hours, members of the judiciary, too, have pitched in, arguing that making Tamil the language of the courtrooms would make it easy for litigants, especially those from rural areas.  On the face of it, one can look at the question asked in the Rajya Sabha as one pertaining only to the judiciary. But that would be missing the point. The political context is the renewed attempt by the DMK to invoke pride in Tamil language. Stalin has, on more than one occasion in the past four years, spoken against moves to promote Hindi at the cost of Tamil in Tamil Nadu. Strangely, the DMK glosses over its failure to get the then UPA government, in which it was a partner, to get its way in 2006. Matters have only got more difficult now with the Centre citing the SC order and the NDA government's own emphasis on Hindi.  The language card has become a rallying point for a Dravidian party, like the DMK, against the BJP, which is seen as a Hindi and Hindutva party in the state. The BJP, too, has given enough opportunities. The provocation came soon after the party came to power in May, 2014. According to a report of  ,  that year asking government employees and officials of all ministries, departments, corporations and banks to use “Hindi or both Hindi and English” on their social media accounts, but “give priority to Hindi”. Recently, when milestones on the National Highways in different parts of Tamil Nadu, like Krishnagiri and Vellore, were painted with names in Hindi, Stalin accused the BJP government of Hindi hegemony. It took an uproar with threats of reviving the anti-Hindi agitation of the 1960s to force the authorities to pull back.  Even on the day the Budget was presented in Parliament, social media users from Tamil Nadu criticised finance minister Arun Jaitley for frequently switching into Hindi during his speech.  What is the game plan behind the renewed focus on Tamil? With elections in 2019 and the possibility of Assembly polls taking place anytime, if the fragile AIADMK government collapses, the DMK seems to have zeroed in on the Tamil template. The intention, it would seem, is to combat the nationalistic slogan of the BJP with its own brand of Tamil sub-nationalism. In a sense, it is similar to how Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah is harping on Kannadiga pride, with emphasis on Kannada language and Karnataka flag, to offset the brand of nationalism the BJP espouses.  But while it may galvanise a few, Stalin would be committing a mistake if he makes it the cornerstone of his campaign. 2018 is not 1965 and a large section of Tamil Nadu sees merit in learning Hindi as a means of communication. After the anti-Hindi agitation, India has followed a three-language formula with English, Hindi and the regional language at the school level. It seems that just like the DMK under Annadurai rode on the anti-Hindi agitation to come to power, Stalin is borrowing the template in a post-Jayalalithaa era. But if the DMK tries to make Tamil Nadu into a parochial island, harping solely on the Tamil identity, it faces the risk of boomeranging.  What Stalin and team seem to be doing is to mark out a new rival as it fears the rise of BJP in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK has been systematically weakened over the last year. And Stalin, it would seem, wants to fight that battle in chaste Tamil.  This anecdote, however, gives an interesting spin to DMK's anti-Hindi position. The story goes that Karunanidhi was asked why he nominated a young Dayanidhi Maran to the UPA Cabinet in 2004 when there were senior DMK MPs available. Karunanidhi is believed to have said Dayanidhi knew Hindi. ","nationalist":0,"positivity":0.0505,"negativity":0.071,"modiCount":2,"bjpCount":6,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":1,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":4},{"content":"West Bengal residents were treated to a curious sight on Sunday, the day Ram Navami was celebrated across the country.

One, though a nascent force in Bengal, BJP has already succeeded in triggering a fundamental shift in the state's political discourse. Two, Mamata Banerjee is trying to pro-actively nip in the bud BJP's attempts to consolidate the Hindu votes. These statements are not at variance with each other. If we look at the political discourse leading up to the 2016 Assembly elections, the focus was on unabashed minorityism. At roughly 30 percent, Bengal has a sizeable Muslim population. Through her policies and politics, the Trinamool Congress chief was   the 'votebank'. Soon after ending Left's three-decade stranglehold over Bengal and rising to power in 2011,   a state-sponsored monthly stipend of Rs 2500 and \"own land, own house\" for each of the state's \"30000 to 40000\" imams. Over the years, she has   this strategy. The Bengal chief minister has set up Haj houses, new campus for Aliah University, sanctioned 400 madrasa hostels, and introduced scholarships for Muslim students,  reported. If any criticism for these policies came her way, Mamata showed a remarkable intolerance for dissent and an autocratic style of functioning, quite unlike the \"liberal icon\" image that she is of late trying to promote. In September 2012,   reported how police tried to intimidate the publishers of a book written in Bengali by a senior police officer criticizing Banerjee's policies. The 102-page book Musalamander Koroniyo (What Muslims Should Do) written by Narzul Islam — then the additional director general of the West Bengal police — had criticized the chief minister's move to allow stipends for imams and plans to \"recognize 10,000 madrasas\". According to  police raided the College Street office of the book’s Kolkata publisher, Mitra & Ghosh\". Publisher Indrani Roy told the US-based newspaper that \"government has tried to intimidate us in different ways\". The report further stated, \"Roy said she believes the raid, the first in the publisher’s 80-year history, stems from Banerjee’s intolerance to criticism. 'It is rather unnerving,' she said. 'We are actually very scared. Our freedom is at stake and who knows what will happen tomorrow'.\" These days, however,   that \"only West Bengal can fight against this communal politics and intolerance and save the country.\" During the campaign stage for 2016 Assembly polls, huge cutouts of the chief minister — head covered in white chador and arms joined in prayers to the Almighty — were ubiquitous. Mamata also religiously attended iftaar parties. As an  report from June 2016 notes, \"Banerjee can be seen attending several fast-breaking ceremonies with her cabinet colleagues. With her   and her colleagues wearing skull caps. Banerjee can be even heard quoting Urdu couplets in a bid to display her skills with the language and familiarity with the community.\" Mamata's campaign speeches in Muslim-majority areas ended with an invocation to Allah, as a report in   in April 2016 noted. \"Allah ho Akbar,' she (Mamata) cries out, adding, 'La Ilah Ilalah Mohammad un Rasool Allah. Inshallah, paribartan hobe (God willing, there will be change).' For West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, no stump speech is complete without a string of invocations aimed at Muslims, who number close to 28 per cent of the State’s population\". Her zeal often led to decisions that drew condemnation from the courts. The Bengal chief minister has been   Calcutta High Court for trying to \"appease the minority section of the public at the cost of the majority section without there being any plausible justification\". Her attempts to prevent the BJP from holding a rally in the state has been quashed. Mamata evidently believed that she can afford to pay a small cost for consolidation of Muslim votes. Two things happened in 2016 Assembly polls. One, the Left and Congress were decimated despite forming an alliance. Two, BJP emerged as the chief Opposition. It didn't take long for Mamata to realise that the Left and the Congress are no longer a threat to TMC. She also realized the need now to focus her attention on BJP, a party that is cadre-based, organised and is adept at playing the waiting game. Mamata drew some quick conclusions. If the Left and Congress are insignificant in Bengal, then there is no longer any need for TMC to attempt a Muslim consolidation. Conversely, she needed to quickly move and prevent BJP's attempts to consolidate the Hindu votes by portraying Mamata as \"anti-Hindu\". Theoretically, even if Mamata succeeds in getting the backing of state's Muslim population, any consolidation of Hindu votes as a countermeasure would damage her politically. The 2017 Ram Navami celebrations, organised by the RSS across Bengal, drew  . It was enough to tell Mamata that she needs a quick resetting of her priorities. The zeal of TMC ministers in snatching Ram away from BJP during Sunday's celebrations was a culmination of this \"reset\" that Mamata has embarked on since last year. Gone were the huge cutouts in strategic locations of the city. On April 2017, Mamata had tweeted: Around this time, Anubrata Mondal, a party leader and a Mamata loyalist, was quoted as  : \"There are 127 Bajrangbali (other name for Hanuman) temples in Birbhum district. On Wednesday evening in each of the temples, puja will be held. All our legislators and other party leaders and workers will take part. We will worship Bajrangbali everywhere.\" In January 2018, TMC organised a   in Bolpur town of Birbhum district where thousands of priests and attendees were given \"a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a shawl and pictures of Sarada Maa and Ramakrishna\" ostensibly to teach them \"real meaning of Hinduism\". Rahul Gandhi's temple run during last year's Gujarat elections seemed to   as well. It is in this context that we must see TMC leaders' zeal in taking out Ram Navami processions and state food minister   armed with a mace. .  reported that Arup Roy, a state minister, has said \"the chief minister had asked all key party functionaries to take out rallies every Sunday until the upcoming panchayat election.\" The winds of change are evident. Trinamool's shift from blatant minorityism to soft Hindutva is in sync with similar attempts from the Congress at the national level. Notably, both parties are at pains to insist that they have been wrongly portrayed as \"pro-Muslim\" in the past, and their temple visits and taking up of Hindu causes are not examples of \"soft Hindutva\" but a move to deny BJP the chance to project itself as the sole savior of Hinduism. Both claim that doing so does not make them \"any less secular\". It is here that BJP has scored a major victory. Under Narendra Modi, the party has reinvented \"secularism\", breaking its unanimity with \"minorityism\". What we are witnessing in Bengal is TMC's attempt to respond to this changed definition. The likely repercussions of this churning (disempowerment of Muslims, for one) will be evident over time. What is of immediate interest is how it affects voter behavior. By all purposes, we should get a definitive answer by 2019.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.063,"negativity":0.0455,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":8,"rssCount":1,"hindutvaCount":2,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":5},{"content":"An unidentified person hurled a shoe at AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi when he was addressing a rally at Nagpada in south Mumbai on Tuesday, 23 January, the police said.

In a press release by Anoop George Chaudhary from the AICC legal cell, the Supreme Court unit of the AICC has clarified that they have nothing to do with the PIL filed by Poonawalla over the Rafale issue. The press release states that Poonawalla’s PIL seeks for the disclosure of the renegotiated price of the Rafale deal and the party explicitly denied any involvement in the PIL as it has been filed on Poonawalla’s individual capacity. The press release goes further to insist that the Congress party does not have even the ‘remotest’ connection with the PIL or Poonawalla and the party thinks that the apex court is not the forum for raising such issues. The letter concludes by reasserting that the party in no way can be linked to Poonawalla or his PIL. It is notable here that Tehseen Poonawalla , who is a vocal supporter of the Congress party and the brother-in-law of Robert Vadra, had filed a PIL in the SC seeking the disclosure of the renegotiated Rafale deal in March 2018 . While the Congress party has been incessantly attacking  the government over the deal alleging  that corruption has taken place and the deal was done to benefit Anil Ambani’s firm, the abrupt announcement of distancing itself from Poonawalla’s PIL is being questioned by many on social media.

Similarly, Sunil Chhetri’s feat of equaling Lionel Messi’s record for the number of international goals may seem paler when one compares the quality of their respective opponents. The Indian policy space is facing a novel tussle between the quantity and quality of administrative achievements. Having aced successive political communication battles, the BJP-led NDA government has also established its own paradigm for communication of governance-related results. After all, what are the chances of the median voter digging into headline data? Such onerous exercises attract only a small section of the society. For instance, in April 2018, the government claimed that India had achieved 100 percent electrification. The devil in the detail emerged only when some pointed out that 100 percent village electrification   mean 100 percent  electrification. There are, in fact, over 3 crore rural households without any access to electricity. An electrified village, on the other hand, is defined as a village with access to basic electricity infrastructure, and where public places and at least 10 percent households have been electrified. An ODF village is one where no visible fecal matter can be found in the surroundings, and where all households and public institutions use “safe technology option for disposal of faeces”. Remarkably, the number of ODF villages has increased by 725 percent, from around 47 thousand in 2015-16 to almost 3.88 lakh (as of 25 June 2018). As per guidelines, once a   declares itself as ODF, at least two inspections – within the subsequent 3 and 9 months – are to be carried out to confirm the same. It seems though, that around 90 thousand of these villages have not been verified. Quality and sustainability of the scheme across these villages is not beyond doubt, and therefore, neither is the claim that 17 of the country’s states/UTs can be deemed as ODF. The fact that   for ODF verification suggest that  two inspections be carried out, provides no incentives for the local administration to continue with similar exercises. Yet, an increase of 3.41 lakh in the number of ODF villages sounds like a massive achievement (and is an important part of an otherwise incomplete story). Similarly, the government’s claim to have saved Rs 90,000 crores owing to its Direct Benefit Transfer initiative should merit plaudits. As per official claims, most of these savings have been made owing to de-duplication and deletion of fake or non-existent beneficiaries from official records. Yet, MGNREGA provides a good example of just how lack of quality-monitoring tends to exaggerate administrative achievements. Although DBT for wage payment under MGNREGA may have streamlined administrative processes, the system’s efficacy is not beyond doubt. On one hand, imposition of the DBT system (with some exceptions) in early 2016 placed the cart before the horse by demanding that even the remotest of villages process payments electronically (irrespective of the quality of their internet infrastructure and capacity of local officials). At the same time, official data suggests that the process of transferring money from the governments’ accounts to beneficiaries’ accounts is taking much longer than expected. Official data (as of 23 June 2018), nevertheless, suggests that 20 percent of all dues uploaded for payment processing during 1-16 June 2018 (all of which should have been processed by 23 June) remain unpaid. This may have adversely affected over a quarter of all MGNREGA workers who worked during this period. Notably, owing to India’s agricultural cycle and weather patterns, the months of May and June usually witness the highest demand for MGNREGA work within the year. Delays during this period of increased distress fly in the face of the program’s fundamental spirit. The absence of a coherent counter-narrative has only helped the incumbent government. To some extent, one can blame the lack of credibility within the Opposition, which has resulted in a one-sided communication monopoly for the government. In fact, back in the days of UPA-II, it was not as much the irregularities that the CAG discovered but the astronomical numbers associated with the 2G spectrum sale and coal block allocations that dealt a blow to the government of the day. The Opposition of the day got lucky, for not only did it receive these big numbers to fling at the ruling government, it piggybacked on the claims of an independent authority that was perceived as credible. The very fact that we are critically reviewing the quality of public delivery suggests that on numerous fronts, we have overcome the challenge of scaling up services. That is a fact that one can’t deny. After all, it took only 31 percent of the country’s voters to hand over a decisive mandate to the BJP in 2014. With current political developments, even if that threshold were to rise up by a few percentage points, the   may well be enough. The government need only target the required “critical mass”, which consists of voters who have either benefited from this scale-up or perceive the scale-up to be a big enough achievement in itself.

Addressing a meeting of All India Christian Federation at YMCA, Secunderabad on Monday evening, Uttam Kumar Reddy said that ‘Jesus willed Governance’ will come in Telangana only if Congress is voted to power by defeating both TRS and the BJP.

He’s heading into an election year and there, on a flower-bedecked stage in front of the Karnataka state Assembly, Opposition leaders he thought would never come together held up their arms in a show of unity to sound the bugle for a Modi versus All battle in 2019. The occasion was the swearing-in ceremony of HD Kumaraswamy as chief minister of a JD(S)-Congress government. However, it would be foolhardy to jump to conclusions from one grand show of camaraderie by the Opposition. But for the first time in the four years that the Modi government has been in office, it would seem that the road to 2019 is not a one-way street. If the show of Opposition unity translates into seat pacts on the ground, a contest is very much in the offing and the outcome is anyone’s guess. Modi@4 is a sharp contrast to Modi@3. Last year, at this time, he was riding high, having swept the UP Assembly polls with a record number of seats. However, the past year has not been kind to him. A series of electoral and political setbacks has tarnished the aura of invincibility. Growing unrest in the countryside has left gaping holes in Modi’s shining India story. And financial scandals like diamond merchant Nirav Modi’s flight from India, leaving behind a mountain of debts in a public sector bank, has left Brand Modi looking slightly frayed at the edges. Increasingly, the narrative seems to be slipping out of Modi’s hands. Claims of fast-paced development through figures trotted out by ministers for rural electrification, gas connections and highways have begun to sound hollow in the wake of brutal rapes in Kathua and Unnao, an eye-popping farmers’ protest march through the streets of Mumbai, a flyover collapse in Modi’s constituency of Varanasi, controversial police encounters in Yogi Adityanath’s UP and continuing joblessness. In fact, the big development in the past one year has been the manner in which the Congress has mastered the tools of social media to fight the BJP on its own turf. This has undoubtedly helped craft a counter narrative that Modi is finding difficult to challenge in a rapidly deteriorating socio-political environment. It is ironic that today, as election year looms, the BJP is teetering dangerously close to squandering the majority it won so handsomely in 2014. In four years, it has lost nine seats in by-polls, bringing its numbers in the Lok Sabha down to 273. And last week, two of its Karnataka MPs including BS Yeddyurappa, resigned before taking oath as MLAs in the state Assembly. Modi has also lost two major allies, Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP and Shiv Sena, which has declared that it will fight the general election on its own. There’s trouble brewing in Bihar as well. What seemed to be a great coup when the BJP reclaimed Nitish Kumar from Lalu Yadav is rapidly turning sour. Smaller partners like Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Khushwaha have teamed up with Nitish to form a ginger group which is giving the BJP a hard time. Also, although it received a huge shock in the Assembly elections in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, the BJP managed to scrape through and stop the Congress from pulling off a major upset. Many analysts feel that despite the setbacks, Modi’s personal appeal is still strong. But his fifth year is going to be tough for him despite his phenomenal communication skills and ability to connect directly with people. Street protests are growing and turning increasingly violent as the marginalised and the dispossessed fight the State for a better deal. Tuticorin, where 12 persons were killed in police firing during the recent protests against big corporate interests, brings back grim reminders of Nandigram which proved to be the last nail in the Left Front’s coffin in Bengal. And Modi still hasn’t come up with a plan of action to implement his biggest 2014 election promise: Job creation. He needs an out-of-the-box idea to regain control of the narrative before it’s too late. If Karnataka is a sign of things to come, the momentum may be shifting to the other side.

Like many far-left liberals, he is also seen indulging in hate-mongering by calling for Amit Shah’s murder. Brazenly attempting to incite the Muslims, the Tamil academician is heard telling the crowd that “he expected but no Muslim doing it”, hinting that he expected that the Muslims in the country would kill Home Minister Amit Shah for implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act, which they have been falsely claiming to be anti-Muslims, but no Muslim has yet killed him. Nellai Kannan said this at a rally by Islamist organisation SDPI. Nellai Kannan has fought elections on a Congress ticket in the past and is largely viewed as a Congress supporting voice. The Islamist outfit PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after merging three fringe Muslim outfits – the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of the Tamil Nadu – to protect “interest of the backward and oppressed people.” In Kerala, most of its leaders were members of the banned Student Islamic Movement of India. Reportedly, the PFI was allegedly involved in at least 24 political murders in Kerala. The Islamist outfits Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and its sister organisation PFI Popular Front of India have been accused of extreme communalism and has a long history of resorting to violence against their political opponents. The PFI is also accused by the National Investigation Agency for being involved in love-jihad cases in Kerala. Recently, the SDPI members were also arrested in connection with the brutal murder of ABVP worker in Kannur. Recently, PFI members were accused of killing 42-year-old activist Ramalingam. The activist was brutally murdered for opposing religious conversion. The accused PFI members have been preaching conversion to Islam. In December, two people, former members of the extremist Islamist organisation, Popular Front of India (PFI) had joined the IS. The police said that K Sajjad and Anwar Poothappara had links with the radical Islamic outfit in the past. The anti-CAA Muslim mob has been on a rampage in various parts of the country since the Citizenship Act was brought in by the Modi government. While several Pakistani Hindu migrants across the country have been celebrating and lauding the passing of the historic Citizenship Amendment Act, which has brought their lost hope back, Muslim mobs had gone on a rampage, destroying public property and creating chaos. In fact, UP DGP OP Singh had said that members of radical Islamic organisations – Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political front, Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), including political parties like Samajwadi Party were involved in instigating Muslim mobs to indulge in violence across the state during the anti-CAA protests. Three people associated with the radical Islamic organisation PFI, including UP state head Waseem, have been arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police for orchestrating violence by spreading misinformation through social media platforms. While the anti-CAA lobby has been resorting to severe violence, stone pelting, vandalism and arson to voice their dissent, the left-brigade has been continuously trying to incite the citizens against the government. On December 19, a video surfaced in which a Maulana was heard passing derogatory remarks against India’s PM Narendra Modi and HM Amit Shah, threatening to wage ‘jihad’ in India as he rejects to accept the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) bill by falsely claiming that they are anti-Muslim.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.067,"negativity":0.14275,"modiCount":2,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":1,"_deepnote_index_column":11},{"content":"ABP News Journalist Rubika Liyaquat, known for her tenacious attitude, has become the victim of radical Islamists yet again.

Mamata Banerjee claimed that Narendra Modi had not taken care of his wife and went on to ask how will he take care of the country.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.044250000000000005,"negativity":0.057,"modiCount":1,"bjpCount":1,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":0,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":14},{"content":"Two incidents have made it to national headlines within the space of a few hours that highlight very real cultural problems in India today. The two incidents might appear extremely different on the face of it but both of them highlight a very significant problem within Indian society. By any measure, the Faridabad incident and the Munger shooting are indeed absolutely shocking.\n\nWe are living in a culture of denial of the obvious. We have made denial of reality the cornerstone of our worldview. Even though all of us are well aware of the truth, we will go to extraordinary lengths to pretend otherwise during public life. For instance, we are well aware that on the best of days, the Police are perceived as people to be avoided at all costs.\n\nThere are the much vaulted arguments about police reforms. One would expect the number 1 priority on that list would be reforming the culture that has come to dominate our police force but somehow, it is never on the agenda. There needs to be far more accountability for the police and far stricter punishment for dereliction of duty. Most of all, it is necessary for everyone to see that justice is being done.\n\nThere is no point in blaming the Police alone. Our systems work because there are great men and women working in the government, the bureaucracy, the Judiciary and the Police who manage to compensate for the systemic flaws just enough so as to ensure that the edifice could be maintained. The system itself is rotten to the very core.\n\nThe Munger shooting is the most obvious in a series of incidents that reflect the utter moral depravity of the secular state. First of all, the Election Commission of India reserved the 28th of October for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly Elections. Either they were not aware of the specific traditions of Munger or they did not believe they were important enough. In either case, it reflects their remarkable incompetence.\n\nThen, the Police suddenly discovered their bravado while dealing with Hindu devotees. There are different versions of what precisely happened but there are videos that suggest that the Police used brutal force against the devotees when they took out a procession for the Visarjan at around midnight on the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe Police apparently thrashed the devotees which sparked a protest that ultimately led to the death of one and critical injuries for six others. Ideally, the entire team of police officials responsible for the madness should be suspended prior to an investigation and charges related to murder ought to be invoked if some of them are found guilty for the death of the Hindu devotee.\n\nThe brutal murder of the Hindu devotee, and that is what it precisely was, highlights a very salient aspect that has been hitherto ignored. Genuine Police reforms ought to be the concern of every concerned Hindu and reforming the culture of the Police is an extremely Hindu issue. Because ultimately, it is the Hindu masses who suffer the most due to police brutality.\n\nThe Police is too afraid to act against even genuine criminals from minority Abrahamic communities because they are actually scared for their lives. It is the law-abiding Hindus which bear the brunt of their brutality as it is against the weak that the bullies discover their strength all of a sudden. And make no mistake, the ordinary masses of all communities are weak.\n\nSome compensate for it by building tight-knit communities where ‘One for All, All for One’ is the motto. Those communities that fail to do so have to suffer the consequences for their lack of organisation. We cannot afford to live in a culture of denial of the obvious anymore about the actual extent of malfeasance within the Police. And until the Police is reformed, the Hindu masses will continue to suffer and pious devotees will continue to be slaughtered.\n\nImagine the monstrosity of the whole situation. Hindu devotees embark on the annual Visarjan procession and in the way, they are brutalised by the Police and one of them even loses their lives. And yet, after a few days, the same governments which cannot adequately punish and reform the rot that has set in within government institutions will attempt to reform Hindu society itself. It is quite disgraceful.\n\nThe culture of denial is again prominent in the murder of Nikita Tomar in Faridabad. The 21-year old was shot dead in broad daylight by two men outside the Aggarwal college in Ballabgarh. The two accused fled the scene after committing the murder. One of the accused, Taufeeq, appears to have been an obsessive stalker of the girl who murdered her when she refused his advances.\n\nThere is no point in denying here that significant sections of the Muslim community harbour opinions that are radically at odds with the mandate of civil society. Reports have emerged which suggest that the victim was being coerced into converting to Islam and marry the accused which she was resisting. And hence, she was murdered.\n\nInstead of speaking out against this menace, our cultural institutions are busy promoting nonsense such as the Tanishq ad which actually leads to the death of Hindu women. In this particular instance, it was a case of Islamist murder but there have been too many occasions in the past when Muslim boys have lured Hindu women by forging false identities and subsequently murdered them when their actual identity was discovered.\n\nThe two incidents highlight the fact that we cannot afford to live in a culture of denial anymore. It leads to the actual death of ordinary Hindu citizens who want nothing more than to live in peace. The elites might delude themselves by intricate fantasies but the masses do not have the luxury of entertaining such delusions.\n\nUntil we rid ourselves of the culture, ordinary Hindu citizens will continue to be murdered with impunity and without any consequences when all they want to do is participate in the Visarjan of their beloved deity. Until we rid ourselves of the culture, we will continue to have murders like that of Nikita Tomar who had to forfeit her life because she did not wish to marry a psychopath.\n\nBoth these incidents are heart-breaking, to put it mildly. But there are lessons from them that Hindus must learn. Until the appropriate lessons are learnt, such incidents will continue to occur with an obscene frequency. The unfortunate deaths of both Nikita Tomar and the Hindu devotee in Munger should only strengthen our resolve to ensure the reformation that we seek in our institutions and public life.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.09,"negativity":0.1845,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":0,"_deepnote_index_column":15},{"content":"In a shocking display of intolerance and bigotry, a group of radical Islamists attacked over 10 Hindu families on Sunday at Korbanpur village under Muradnagar Upazila in the Comilla district of Bangladesh.\n\nAs per reports, the Hindu households were selectively vandalised and later set on fire after a man allegedly expressed solidarity with France and defended the Charlie Hebdo cartoons in Facebook comments.

While addressing at Shri Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkur today the speaks on the government historic decision to impose the newly amended Citizenship Act. Greeting everyone present at the Mutt, he asked the nation to remember how the last decade began. In contrast, he said, the third decade of the 21st Century has started on a strong footing of expectations and aspirations. “This aspiration is to see India as a prosperous, capable and all-encompassing world power. It has now become the psyche of every Indian that the problems we have inherited have to be solved. This message emanating from the society also inspires, encourages our government,” said the PM. Modi slammed Congress and its allies, saying they are against giving relief to those who have been brutalised and victimised in Pakistan. “Pakistan was formed on the basis of religion, religious minorities were being persecuted there. The persecuted were forced to come to India as refugees. But Congress and its allies don’t speak against Pakistan, instead, they are taking out rallies against these refugees,” PM Modi said. Strongly defending the amended Citizenship Act Modi asked anti-CAA protesters rioting at the behest of Congress and other Opposition parties, to raise their voice against Pakistan’s atrocities of the past. To those who are agitating against the Parliament of India, Prime Minister said, “If you have to agitate, raise your voice against the exploits of Pakistan in the last 70 years. Now the need is to expose this action of Pakistan at the international level. If you have to raise slogans, then raise slogans related to the way minorities are being tortured in Pakistan. If you have to take out a procession then take out a procession in support of Hindu-Dalit-victim-exploited from Pakistan”. Our Govt is working tirelessly to solve the problems that have persisted in India for decades. We’re working to ensure that every poor has a house, a gas connection, clean drinking water, healthcare, insurance cover, and every village gets broadband service, said PM Modi addressing the programme at Shri Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkur, Karnataka. Talking about the schemes which had been introduced by the government for farmers, Modi said that the BJP government had done all these keeping in mind the welfare of the agricultural community in India.

While a Tanishq showroom in Gujarat has condemned the ad and apologised to the Hindu community for it, liberals are falling over backwards in justifying it. Perhaps the most clownish ‘hot take’ came from senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor who decided to pounce upon the occasion to peddle his personal delusions.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, we would ignore such comments as the mad ramblings of a con-artist who has long passed his sell-by date but since the opinion has been voiced by an individuals who ‘larps’ as an intellectual, it deserves a response.\n\nShashi Tharoor remarked on Tuesday, “If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them (‘Hindutva bigots’) so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?” This is a preposterous claim. A country that lost huge portions of its territory to Islamic terrorism only seventy-three years ago cannot be the longest surviving symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ by default.\n\nSo Hindutva bigots have called for a boycott of ⁦@TanishqJewelry⁩ for highlighting Hindu-Muslim unity through this beautiful ad. If Hindu-Muslim “ekatvam” irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India? pic.twitter.com/cV0LpWzjda\n\n— Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) October 13, 2020\nEven after an event as cataclysmic and traumatic as the partition of 1947, if certain individuals wish to propagate India as a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, then they are deluding themselves. It is also evident in everyday discourse that India is not the symbol Shashi Tharoor and members of his party wish it to be.\n\nThe events since 2019 have cemented these facts and have left no room for doubt. The response to the abrogation of Article 370, the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Ram Mandir verdict highlighted the seemingly irreconcilable differences between the two communities in excruciating detail.\n\nWhile ‘secular’ intellectuals and politicians prefer to sing paeans to ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’, it is an undeniable fact that the only Muslim majority state in the country refused to join the Indian mainstream and clung on to Article 370 that essentially provided for an Islamic state within Indian territory. When the article was abrogated, the Congress party and Muslim-oriented parties opposed it tooth and nail.\n\nWith regards to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Indian Muslims wanted the descendants of those who created Pakistan to have the same privileges as the Hindu, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist populations of the Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan towards whom India has a sacred commitment. The Act witnessed great protests and eventually culminated with communal riots in Delhi.\n\nThe same could be observed in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi. Much violence and bloodshed could have been avoided if the Muslim community had chosen to respect the special attachment that Hindus have towards the birthplace of Rama. But they refused to, they fought until the very end for a Masjid built by an Islamic tyrant after demolishing a Hindu Temple.\n\nThus, we see that the much exalted ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ that charlatans such as Shashi Tharoor evaporates into thin air on every major contentious issue. ‘Evaporates into thin air’ is perhaps the wrong phrase to use here since such a unity never existed in the first place. And these are only three of the most contentious issues in recent times.\n\nThere are other long-standing issues such as cow smuggling and consumption of beef where there is no consensus between the two communities. Things escalated to such a degree that members of Youth Congress slaughtered a calf in broad daylight in Kerala and consumed its meat. That the leader of such a party claims that India is a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ is indeed a disgrace.\n\nHaving said that, it is true that India is a symbol of a greater ideal. There is an idea at the core of the Republic of India, unfortunately enough, it is an idea that is reviled by men and women of a secular bent. However, it cannot be denied that India is the manifestation of the Hindu Civilization in the Age of Modernity and it is the custodian of the great civilization. It is India’s sacred duty to serve and protect our Hindu Civilization.\n\nThus, India is not a symbol of ‘Hindu-Muslim unity’ but evidence of the superiority of Hinduism itself. India is the only country that is home to a heterogenous polytheistic culture. For Indians, the multiplicity of the Divine is not a theoretical proposition but a lived reality. There is no other country in the world where its citizenry worships a multitude of Gods and Goddesses, with their own unique strands of traditions and ritualistic obeisance, with equal fervour.\n\nMaa Durga, Shri Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Maheshwara, Swami Ayyappa, Ganapati, Kartikeya, Lakshmi, Saraswati, there is a plethora of Gods in the Hindu pantheon and we worship the many. A wise man once remarked that polytheism is the highest expression of human consciousness and it is only in India that it finds its true expression in the 21st century. India is the cradle of civilization that has shaped and continues to shape the destinies of multiple nations. And it is so because of Hinduism and Hinduism alone.\n\nThus, secular politicians may want us to bend over backwards to accommodate their perverse fantasies but their misguided notions shall find place in our country no more. Hinduism is India’s destiny and it is Hinduism that defines India at the international order. There is no need for us to be apologetic about India’s Hindu identity; we are living in an age of Hindu assertiveness after all. Shashi Tharoor may be uncomfortable with the idea but it is one that he will have to live with.\n\nFor it is the invisible threads of Dharma that holds our country together. Peoples from different cultural, linguistic, regional backgrounds with their own unique traditions and culture lend their allegiance to India not because of fancy ideals enshrined in our Constitution. They do so because such diverse peoples are held together by the strands of Hinduism that is not always visible but always felt nonetheless.\n\nOnly Hinduism could ever hope to hold such a diverse country together. And there in lies its inherent superiority. Thus, India’s destiny and Hinduism’s are intertwined inseparably and it is one that will last till eternity.

The statement said that people should be aware of the challenges faced by the nation just months after securing independence.\n\n\nBillboard informing J&K residents about invasion of Kashmir by Pakistani militias on October 22, 1947(Black Day)\n“Pakistan invaded Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947, and brought in its wake horrifying mass plunder and vandalism. Thousands of men, women and children were mercilessly slaughtered by the intruders. Four days later, on October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession, merging his state with India. Following the accession of the state to India, Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar, the state capital to repel the tribal invasion,” the statement noted.\n\nPakistan Army launched ‘Operation Gulmarg’ to snatch Jammu and Kashmir\nSoon after the partition, the Pakistani leadership, both civilian and military, was desperate and determined to expand its territorial area. Several attempts were made by Pakistani leaders, including Mohammad Ali Jinnah to convince Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir to accede to Pakistan. However, Singh had remained adamant on his demand to have an independent princely state.\n\nSoon after the independence, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called ‘Operation Gulmarg‘ and put it into action. According to the plan, 20 Lashkars (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribals, were to recruited from various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. The armed Lashkars were expected to reach their launching point in Abbottabad on October 18, and subsequently cross into Jammu and Kashmir on October 22, 1947. The primary objective of the Operation was to capture Srinagar by October 26, 1947.\n\nThe 20 Lashkars were to be divided into a group of 2—10 militia tribes were expected to attack the Kashmir Valley through Muzaffarabad and the remaining ten were expected to join the rebels in Poonch, Rawalkot and Bhimber from where they were to advance to Jammu.\n\nBLACK DAY\n\nOn this day, Lashkars armed with axes, swords & guns backed by #Pakistan Army attacked Jammu & Kashmir.

Akbar Khan, who was entrusted with the operation, devised a plan to make the Kashmir rebellion appear like a revolt waged by the people of Jammu and Kashmir against their non-Muslim rulers. The aim here was to take the cover of civilian unrest for the impending military action. Through a concerted attempt, rebellion against Maharaja Hari Singh was ginned up and rebels were encouraged to take up arms against the Hindu ruler.\n\nAs a prelude to this plan, Pakistan stopped the supply of essential goods like petrol, oil, food, sugar, salt etc. to Jammu and Kashmir, effectively blockading the state and thereby actively stoking rebellion against Maharaja Hari Singh.\n\nPakistani Pashtun tribal militias and Pakistani Army regulars invade Jammu and Kashmir\nThe weeks of planning and illicit manoeuvrings under Operation Gulmarg culminated into the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir which marked the commencement of the events that led to the first Indo-Pak war. In the wee hours of October 22, 1947, scores of Pakistani Pashtun tribal militias, in connivance with the Pakistani state and army surreptitiously crossed the border from Garhi Habibullah into Jammu and Kashmir and attacked the town of Muzaffarabad.\n\nSeveral accounts claim that the tribal raiders, raised by the Pakistani Army, were aided by the traitors of the 4 KI guarding the outposts at Lohar Gali and Ramkot. Many Muslim forces tasked with protecting the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir mutinied and colluded with the rampaging Pashtun tribesmen to defeat the forces deployed by Maharaja Hari Singh.\n\nThese rebels provided crucial information to the armed raiders about the troop deployment and position and helped them prevail over them. Even before the sleeping residents of Muzaffarabad could realise, the town was already under the control of invading Pashtun militias. Documented accounts state that hundreds of women were raped and abducted, houses looted and men slaughtered on the streets.\n\nAfter wreaking havoc in Muzaffarabad, the Pashtuns marched towards the prosperous town of Baramulla, even though the path to Srinagar was clear. Here too, the Pashtuns killed innumerable men and women, looted houses and then set them on fire. Out of 14,000 population at the time, less than two thousand had remained. Most of them were either killed in the Pashtun onslaught or fled the village for safer places.\n\nThe ‘Lashkars’ wreaked havoc, killed, raped and looted Hindus and Muslims alike\nThe invading tribal groups had no regard for anyone. They ran riot, leaving chaos, destruction and killings in their wake. They even raped nuns, who were performing their duties at St. Joseph Hospital and schools in Baramulla. Even doctors, paramedics, and nurses tending to the sick and incapacitated were not spared. They were, too, subjected to a brutal assault by the invading tribesmen.\n\nAs Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani regular army soldiers were busy looting Kashmiris in Baramulla, defiling their women and vandalising the properties, Maharaja Hari Singh sought an intervention from India to stop the devastation, which was contingent upon his signing of Instrument of Accession.\n\nAfter Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India on October 26, 1947, the Indian Armed forces were airlifted to the Kashmir Valley the next day. The Army launched an aggressive offence against the rampaging Pashtuns and stopped their march towards Srinagar. In the subsequent months, the Indian Army purged the state of the Pashtun tribesmen and Pakistani regulars and forced them to retreat to what is present-day Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.\n\nFor years, Pakistan perpetuated the myth that tribal raiders were liberators who had come to Kashmir to fulfil their religious obligation of jihad and avenge the deaths of Muslims killed in the communal riots in Jammu. However, in reality, the tribesmen were not carrying out any religious war or jihad. They were there to brazenly trample upon the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir, rape and dishonour the women, plunder and pillage Kashmiri, regardless of their religion.\n\nThey were aided, provided and instigated by the regulars in the Pakistani army. Whose motive, to this day, remains to add the region of Jammu and Kashmir to the territory of Pakistan and push India’s northern border further down.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.041,"negativity":0.11025,"modiCount":0,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":1,"pakistanCount":6,"_deepnote_index_column":19},{"content":"Ever since the abrogation of Article 370, the pro-Islamist lobby has been gunning for Prime Minister Modi with the most despicable lies and propaganda. Several pro-Islamist Indian journalists took it upon themselves to defame India internationally, while others, habitually peddle lies through proxy websites and social media to tarnish the image of India after the Modi government decided to abrogate Article 370 and finally, fully integrate the new Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India. The pro-Islamist lobby has now found a new way to hit-out at PM Modi, albeit, with lies and deceit. In the parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Modi hit out at Kashmir politicians like Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti for their threats prior to the abrogation of Article 370. Prime Minister Modi in parliament first quoted Mehbooba Mufti. Read: Jammu and Kashmir: NC’s Omar Abdullah and PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti booked under Public Safety Act PM Modi quoted a tweetstorm by Mehmooba Mufti on the 5th of August, the day Article 370 was abrogated. Specifically, PM Modi referred to this tweet where Mehbooba Mufti had questioned what Kashmir got for “choosing India.” Then, PM Modi referred to Omar Abdullah and said Omar had said, “आर्टिकल 370 को हटाना ऐसा भूकंप लाएगा की कश्मीर भारत से अलग हो जायेगा (The abrogation of Article 370 would bring a massive earthquake that it will divide Kashmir from India.)”. Before we get into how the propagandists are now trying to twist PM Modi’s words, one must understand the context in which PM Modi was speaking. First, PM Modi spoke at length about the development that has taken place in Jammu and Kashmir. He then spoke about how there are charges that the Abrogation of Article 370 was against the tenets of the Constitution of India. It was then that PM Modi quoted Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah to explain how it was their statements that were against the very tenets of the Constitution and the territorial integrity of India. Read: AltNews’ Pratik Sinha helps New Yorker water down Pulwama attack, cast aspersions that Balakot airstrike was fabricated To understand this better, here are parts of what Mehbooba Mufti had said after the abrogation of Article 370. “Decision of J&K leadership to reject 2 nation theory in 1947 & align with India has backfired. Unilateral decision of GOI to scrap Article 370 is illegal & unconstitutional which will make India an occupational force in J&K. GOIs intentions are clear. They want the territory of J&K by terrorising it’s people. Those elements in J&K who rejected the constitution & sought resolution under the UN have been vindicated. GOIs intention is clear & sinister. They want to change the demography of the only Muslim majority state in India, disempower Muslims to the extent where they become second class citizens in their own state. What did J&K get for acceding to India? Another partition along communal lines? Our special status isn’t a gift bestowed upon us. Its a right guaranteed by the same parliament. A contract entered into by J&K leadership & India. Today the very same contract has been violated (sic).” Further, Omar Abdullah had said that this decision will have ‘dangerous consequences’ almost threatening the Union of India. To understand what he meant by these threats, one must look at Omar Abdullah’s 2014 tweet-storm where he had elucidated exactly what these ‘consequences’ were. Essentially, both Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti had spoken about breaking India up, inciting violence and supporting terrorists and separatists of Kashmir if Article 370 was abrogated. In fact, after being put under house arrest, Omar Abdullah had also raised questions on Kashmir acceding to India and said that the accession was based on Article 370, essentially hinting that now that Article 370 has been abrogated, there is no reason for Kashmir to be a part of India. In fact, Omar Abdullah’s statement post the abrogation of Article 370 and those of Rahul Gandhi, whose party is today shielding Omar Abdullah from the statements of PM Modi were quoted by Pakistan in their anti-India dossier to UNHRC. Now that these problematic and dangerous statements were mentioned by PM Modi in the parliament itself after time had wiped them clean from public memory, the lobby had to find a way to save face, as they always do, when Islamists are exposed. The Lutyens cabal then focussed on one word that was used by the Prime Minister as a ‘matter of speech’, in order to whitewash the threats issued by the Kashmir leaders only points to a deeper malaise within the Lutyens ecosystem. Several propagandists took to Twitter to claim that PM Modi was lying and that he had, in fact, quoted a satire website Faking News and passed the word ‘Earthquake’ as an authentic quote by Omar Abdullah. The trope was started by propagandists like Swati Chaturvedi and to help the narrative reach further, self-proclaimed fact-checkers like AltNews who have been caught peddling lies often also chimed in along with Congress and other usual suspects. What the propagandists were trying to do is shield Islamist leaders from Kashmir like Omar Abdullah and latch on to one word, while hiding the truly seditious statements that Abdullah and Mufti had given after the abrogation of Article 370. The chorus would have been funny if not tragic. ‘will cause earthquakes’ is a popular figure of speech and even their favourite Rahul Gandhi had used it. PM Modi simply paraphrased it. Just that it happened to have been used on Faking News too, doesn’t mean he quoted Faking News. Basically, PM Modi used a figure of speech to paraphrase whatever was said by the Kashmir politicians. While the manner in which PM Modi paraphrased Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti did not alter the meaning of their sentiment, the same cannot be said about the cabal. In fact, paraphrasing and interpreting wrongly the meaning of PM Modi says has been the favourite strawman tactic used by the cabal for a long time with the media happily playing along, just as it is now. Going back to point from where the vilification of Prime Minister Modi started – The Gujarat riots of 2002. Times of India had reported that speaking about the riots, PM Modi had said that ‘every action has a reaction’, essentially meaning that the burning of Hindus has been answered with the riots. However, Modi had never said this. After TOI reported this blatant lie, several op-eds by media foot soldiers were written demonising Modi. Later, in 2013, before the 2014 General Elections, media had misquoted Modi yet again. They reported that Modi had compared Muslims to dogs by saying that even if a dog died, he would have felt bad. In reality, it was again only a metaphor used. Modi had essentially said that we are human beings who feel bad even if an animal dies, the Muslims and Hindus who died were human beings and he is pained by their death. The most recent was PM Modi’s “15 Lac” comment during the run-up to 2014 elections. PM Modi had said, to quantify the amount of black money stashed abroad that if we ever got all the black money back to India, there was so much, that every person could get 15 Lac out of it. That statement was twisted to report that PM Modi had promised the people of India that he would credit Rs 15 Lac to every citizen’s account. The politicians used that to call Modi a liar and the media simply played along, throwing every ethic of journalism to the wind. This is just the tip of the iceberg in the saga of how politicians and their pens for hire have misquoted and maligned PM Modi ever since his Gujarat days, that how ‘project vilify Modi’ is still very much in progress. One has to wonder why the lobby is so desperate at this point in time. Perhaps because with the anti-CAA riots and Muslim mobs wreaking havoc, the carefully crafted narrative of how the only problem that ails India is that of “Hindutva” is falling apart, or because of Shaheen Bagh and how the media aided the Islamists there have exposed the true face of the cabal. Either way, the desperation of the pro-Islamist lobby is rather evident if they had to cling on to such strawman arguments to vilify the Prime Minister.","nationalist":1,"positivity":0.0545,"negativity":0.11450000000000002,"modiCount":29,"bjpCount":0,"rssCount":0,"hindutvaCount":0,"islamCount":2,"pakistanCount":1,"_deepnote_index_column":20}],"rows_bottom":null},"text/plain":"
